        "text": "What's up boys? Welcome back to another Is it Imba or do I suck? Today we have a good friend of mine called Rep This who sent me an email, Hello, Kev I am a 4 5K MMR Protoss struggling versus MASS early Hydras I do not know what to do Perhaps I am too slow on my response But I think that this Zerg build is just too powerful and Protoss will get crushed no matter what they do In this particular replay, I forgot to start my Zealot versus a ling rush, but I didn't lose too many probes And I think I could still be in a winnable position But alas, I got Hydra Thank you for reading this Yours truly, Reptis. All right, Rept, this Let's have a look at your replay This sounds very interesting as you got Ling rushed Now, in the top left, we have our boy Reptish, who is the star of this video We'll be seeing whether he's right Is mass Hydra too Imba? That's the real question here, of course We have our boy, JD, man, who's starting with a 12-pool, which is the fastest Zergling Rush anyone can do It is without speed I have a beautiful guide on how to respond to this Let's see how well Reptish does against 12 pool It gets a Pylon scout, so you should be able to notice rather quickly what will be going on. Now, the way you want to deal with a 12 pool, most of the time is you just get a Gateway, you get a Cybernetics Core, you get a second Gateway, and then you get a Pylon, and then you're going to be completely fine. There's absolutely nothing that your opponent will be able to do. You're gonna bust out one or two Zealots depending on how brave you're feeling and then you shouldn't lose any Probes. Hell, the Zergling shouldn't even get past your wall. If you truly need to, you can always block with a Pylon. Let's see how our boy Raptis does. So to start off with, he almost loses his Probe, barely doesn't while trying to block the Hatchery that is going to go down at around 117, usually from a Pool, uh, 12 Pool. Now at this point Raptis figures it out. Let's see what his response is. One, two, puts a guy in gas, sends another Probe down, I guess. Now, the way you want to build your second gateway is you want to build it either one forward on one over here, so that you can wall with a pylon easily over here or over here, however you want to build your wall. You don't want to build all your buildings in one line, because then in this case, you will never be able to wall up this little area just because if you build a pylon here, there's still a spot here for the Zerglings to go through. Now on top of that, as he mentioned in the email, he forgot to start a zealot, which is extremely stupid, that's truly the only thing you need to be thinking about at this point. Lose the probe for free Right now he realized oh dang it, I need a Zealot. He won't be able to wall off properly because, like I said, he will need a pylon here and a pylon here. Instead, he holds positions his probe, tries a wall, like 10th, that's not a cool wall, that's the Lings in. The Zerg starts attacking the pylon. This is already a very difficult situation. If I was warped this now, I would start an Adept as soon as possible. Chrono boost that and I send my Zealot into the main base while continuing probe production to try and deal with this. The moment you lose more than two Probes, I think this game is pretty much over most of the time at the highest level So far we've seen five workers gone down Maybe one more will go down I'm not sure what he's doing, I just leaves the Adepts over here It's a weird play Okay, yeah, one more, two more workers go down So seven workers die against He killed six Lings and seven workers die That's an extremely bad trade His opponent already has a Hatchery But perhaps it's still possible I mean, this is about 4 4K MMR Both players are Master 3, I believe Let's see how they they go into a longer game most of the time if you're not playing at the highest level you can always come back if you play a lot better than your opponent i'd be confident that i'd be able to make this game work so so far we've really only seen mistakes from raptist but i'm sure we're going to see something really broken from the Zerg relatively soon who is adding some Queens starting to spread some Creep here comes the first Adept white clicks this tumor will be able to get it nowadays of course you can't cancel those tumors anymore since the latest patch That's nice I mean a free tumor is a free tumor I would not let the shade finish There we go. Good job. No third base. So good scout coming out of Raptis here I wouldn't mind seeing a Robotics Facility go down Probably going into a DT drop, which actually is a pretty bad call Usually if your Nexus gets delayed and you have very little money, DT drop is kind of difficult to pull off You don't have enough gas, you don't have enough money. Stargate usually is a lot better. You get earlier damage out on the map and you can really still focus on chrono boosting probes out so it's what I would recommend after a 12 pool to build a Stargate but you know who might rank 6 GM that's who I am just making sure you guys know it's not a brag it's just the truth Adept dies does scout that there's a Drone at the third base which is annoying probably a third, but that's not good You don't want to sacrifice an Adept for that, especially against slow Lings You have to be extremely slow in order to lose your Adept against, what, 10 slow Lings Truly the reaction speed of a raccoon that had a few too many drinks. Don't we know them all? So we see a Warp Prism Now, another mistake that our friend Reptis makes is that he builds the Warp Prism before the Gateways You're supposed to build Gateway, Gateway, then Warp Prism, then take your gases His Probe count is also too low though, so this shouldn't even really be possible He will continue worker production, I guess, relatively soon and then take two gases, but this seems like we're world's worst DT drop in the world And this is another reason why you shouldn't be getting DT drop Meanwhile, our Zerg player, nicely droning up, going up to 45, once these five drones finish, we'll be getting a Lair and probably heading into Hydralisk then, which is what Reptis was struggling against. Now is he a stalker? Might be able to chase away his Overlord Don't think he should be able to get this There's no speed yet on the map And this Warp Prism might be able to do a little bit of damage with these DTs There's no detection There is a Lair so he can start an Overseer Here we go It's on the wrong side of the map though, my friend You're going to need an Overseer at home Hydralisk 10 goes down as well as well as 10 more Lings A little bit of indecision where exactly to warp in JD Man, our friendly neighborhood Zerg, is floating 1,200. minerals as well right now so it's definitely saving for the Broodlord switch DTs do get warped in and this should actually be a kill there is an Overseer being built right now but i mean DT is right clicking a base this should be completely fine right i kind of believe this should be going down this also will never be fine still up yeah and there goes a third base besides to not pick up does pick up and it looks very good actually well doesn't look very good but supply is pretty close, worker count is even, and there's no third base for the Zerg I mean, this is pretty much the dream scenario after his awful start. So at this point on, what you wanna be getting is you wanna get Charge, you don't wanna get a double forge Double forge is always terrible, but especially if you're behind Just play single forge and just get attack upgrades again, Zerg You don't really need armor upgrades Banelings will kill you no matter how many armor upgrades you have Banelings don't care about armor Well, they do, but they actually don't Like, they do so much damage that, armor never really makes a difference So we see some interesting Archon drop here not really getting anything done almost loses the Warp Prism. How much has he killed so far? Well, he hasn't killed a single worker. He killed a couple of extra units but I mean his army just looks so extremely small. He only has four Gateways. His Charge is very late. Does he not realize that he needs to build defenses rather than macro up like he just killed the third base. But he should be doing at this point is just getting more and more units making sure you can't die now we see the Zerg is he actually going to attack I'm not quite sure yeah I guess so he's going to attack with 44 workers this is a complete all-in he is rebuilding the Lair in case he loses his overseer. Plural as there's two Overseers um doesn't want to die to the DT. There's no charge there's no army no upgrades are done I mean what units Just wrapped this actually half He has five Zealots without charge. There's a prism with two Archons flying around But it's, oh my god, drops on top of the hydras and this should never work Oye, yoy, yu, Trap, Trap, this This has to be the saddest game I've watched in my life You absolutely made zero correct 'cause GG gets called and Trap loses the game Well, Trap how to tell you, but first of all, you completely respond incorrectly to 12 pool, do seven workers Then instead of getting Stargate, you get DT drop You kill the third, which is nice Then you play double forge You don't start charged until like a minute later. And you just keep producing workers, even though you know that the other guy is probably on 44 workers, because you just kill this third. I mean, Hydras are good, but you know what? I'm not gonna be the one telling you. Hit it boys! Hey bro you suck! You suck! You suck! You suck bro! All right boys that will be it for today.

        "text": "What's up boys? Welcome back to a new. Is it Imba or do I suck? Today We have the barcode Terran taking up against Mr Fair, the Protoss player, and we'll be looking at whether Protoss is imbalanced or if the barcode player sucks Now, this is one of the more interesting emails I've received Actually, let me read it out while I pass this real fast Protoss lost their entire army because of excellent micro, then managed to remix of no bases and A move my army to death I couldn't have done anything better, and the Protoss is beeping brain dead You must watch this replay, Kevin You must Now, this was all fine, but this email came without a replay. Now, our superstar of the day sent me an email seven hours later. Oh, I forgot the replay. With the replay attached. So even before the game started, I feel like he's already shown his colors a little bit. I think he might be a bit of a moron. But let's hop straight into the game and figure it out ourselves. So, in the top left corner spawning against the Red Terran, it is our superstar of today. It is Mr Barcode, who shall rename Nameless. And at bottom right, one against the Bluthels, it is Terran, who is not quite the hero, not the superstar of this replay, but he's the one whose race we shall be judging whether it's Imba, or if our barcode player just sucks So you just have a standard Barracks first opener into what I can only assume to be a gas? No, all right This is something that I've never seen before, not in a long time at least This most likely will be a gasless expand, which isn't actually a build So the reason why this isn't really a build is because it's really hard to scout any kind of tech You basically need to build a blind Bunker. It's difficult to see third timings if you don't have a Reaper And if you're not putting on any kind of pressure with Factory or Starport units either, then it's just going to be hard to get any kind of information, stuff like DTs, Oracle, save-ups, rushing third bases Basically anything is going to be hard to deal with because from a gases expand, Terran can't actually do that many different things All they can really do is a two or a three Barracks, which doesn't really have dot match potential against people that play at a higher level. Because if you know it can only be a three Barracks, you can just go either straight into Colossus or you can attempt to DT drop into Colossus, DT's into fast three base. There's so many things you can do. The freedom you give the Protoss is absolutely amazing and I can tell you every Protoss would love to play against the gasless Command Center expand. So let's move forward. We do see two more Barracks on the way as that's no real surprise. Two extra refineries being added on top of this as well. Pick supply block for whatever reason by our superstar already. Got supply block at 23 which means he forgot his second Supply Depot for a little bit. Now his natural Command Center will finish up and go straight into an Orbital. Now, our Protoss player actually knows what he's doing. He opens Robo. I like Robo against Gasless Expand once again, because you get the info with the Observers. You can go into early Colossus, which is great. It's absolutely fantastic. And really, the Colossus are the backbone of your army against any kind of Terran opener, which will mainly consist of Marines and Marauders. So with a couple of force fields, one, two Colossus, maybe even an Immortal, if you're very afraid you should be in a very good position as the Protoss player. I really like that he builds the Robo Bay this quick as well. Usually you'll see people go up to three-gate first, maybe even up to four gas. But once again, because he's not playing against any factory opener, that's completely unnecessary. So I'm a very big fan of this and the Observer being Chrono Boosted. Not as big a fan of the Straight Immortal. I wouldn't have minded seeing at least one more observer, as well as because our Protoss player is a plighter, but so far our Protoss player is looking a lot better than our Terran. When it comes to build order choices, this Terran seems a little bit clueless. We have an Engineering Bay on the way as well, a fast third gas. I'm, I have to admit, I'm not extremely familiar with how you're supposed to play it out If you play triple rax, like what your gas timings are, this gas feels very fast, though, for a three-rax opener I'll admit to that The bunker is a safety play a safety play, a couple of Marauders Most of the time as a Terran, you will be looking to hit a Stim Combat Shield timing with this kind of build order So his plus one is a bit ill-timed, I believe As you see, Stim and Combat is going to finish way before plus one will finish. Usually you want all your important upgrades to finish at the same time because right now he's investing a lot in this plus one upgrade, which probably won't matter in the fight unless he decides to wait for it but then why were you rushing the stim and combat shield? Probably better to get a faster Engineering Bay in that case Imagine if a fight would happen now with this I'm not saying that our Terran player has a big chance but he has a better chance right now than in 10 seconds because then the Colossus will be out In general I'm not a massive fan of these weird mass barracks plays especially from Gasless. Yeah our Protoss player moves into position big Stim forward and our Terran player kills exactly Zero units and loses 625 resources So far there's only one person losing their army in a brain that way and that's the Terran Get a second bunker as some kind of safety measure which makes sense. But once again. It's just in a really bad spot and in my mind. If the Protoss player just builds the second Colossi gets a Warp Prism he can just kind of kill these bunkers from a distance with Thermal Lance and from that point on I don't really see a way for the Terran to come back but maybe the Protoss will make some mistakes maybe the Terran makes a magnificent place as he is getting an E-Bay block onto this third base denying the Protoss from expanding here we see the Protoss moving forward with that big immortal power we'll be able to target down that bunker extremely quickly good force field coming out of him as well managed to get one or two Marauders and it feels very tempting to move on here move in here and go for this bunker just right click it but there's no reinforcements there's a bunch of Marauders here, how many is there exactly? There's eight and if you only have a single Colossus, not a lot of Zealots, it can't feel kind of scary. So you always got to be careful here as the Protoss player As a Terran, you're just praying that you are allowed to survive another day after your awful start We do see finally at the 650 mark, we see some Medivacs starting, which is extremely late, usually Medivacs, even from a Starport opener, or a one-one opener, a Barracks Factory Starport opener We do see those Medivacs usually starting at what, maybe 5 30, 545 delay So almost a full-minute delay onto those Medivacs for a push that did absolutely nothing early on So not sure if this is the wisest play for our Terran player Does have a third Command Center on the way as well, but there's also a third Nexus already for a Protoss. So in the base count they're relatively even. I don't favor anyone particularly in the base count I do like the army of the Protoss a lot more right now We'll be going up to three Colossus. I believe, yes, there's the third one moving about Usually after three Colossus is the time you start switching out of Colossus into a more Templar, Immortal-focused play. So with these three Colossus, what you want to do is you want to force out a lot of Vikings from the Terran and then go into Templar, into Immortals, which Vikings don't shoot very well on the ground They're kind of bad on the ground, honestly, kind of slow, can't kite with them. So that's usually the play you want to go forever. We see more Colossus. So a more Colossus focus style. Now, what are we seeing from the Terran? Usually when you're behind as a Terran player, you want to do one of two things. Either you want to go for some kind of SCV ball in, or you want to actually either get very stable. So with tanks, that kind of stuff, and start making walls and bunkers and that kind of composition. Or you just want to start making plays. Now, our friend over here is doing nothing. He has nothing really to keep him extremely safe. He's getting a lot of Vikings. I guess it helps against Colossus, but there's no extra bunkers, no extra tanks. And with just two Medivacs, it's very difficult to make plays. Added to that is that this Observer is seeing absolutely everything. As you can see, this Terran is capable of seeing it. You can always see the shimmering over here. But he's not noticing it. It would be great to scan that away, just to make the Protoss a little bit more scared because in theory the Protoss has complete map vision, complete map control. Now, as long as he sees your army, he knows where you are. He can move wherever he wants. He can set up run bys. He can patrol two Zealots in rather random locations. He really can do what he wants. I mean, there's no issue there. Now, we continue our Viking production as the Terran, which I like. 2-2 is also a good move. So, so far, if we don't take the early game into account, our Terran hasn't been playing too poor. He hasn't really been doing anything. Can't really make mistakes if you don't do anything whatsoever. A little Marine spotting that fourth base knows it's time for his own fourth now. And it would love to see a Ghost Academy go down relatively soon. And as I say it, he just on the Ghost Academy. So this Terran definitely does know how to play. He's no stranger to the game of Starcraft 2. Let's just put it like that. This guy seems pretty all right. Protoss player is trying to shark around a little bit here I wouldn't be surprised if he will be going in for a fourth base deny or something like that Usually if you have a big supply lead, you have your Templar, you have a good Colossus count, you have your charge, get your upgrades going, it's good to make that kind of play, especially if you see that there's no Ghost on the field and that you're completely free to move out wherever you want Now this Viking count is rather healthy, right? 10 Vikings for four Colossus Usually what I say is you want about two and a half to three Vikings for every Colossus there is Maybe three and a half even. So for about four Colossus, about 10 to 15 Vikings, anywhere in between there depending on what the rest of your army looks like should be okayish, majority of the time. So we see a Liberator switch, once again, a good move by the Terran here realizes he doesn't need more Vikings than he has right now. It's like, you know what? I want units that do more for me that, you know, can really control an area. Liberators definitely are a very good choice there. Now, some of the things I would love to see from this Terran, um, a Marine over here for vision, Marine over here for vision, Marine over here for vision, perhaps a turret in this area, and I wouldn't mind the sensor tower over here, the sensor tower over here, to just get this vision of where the Protoss army is moving, especially if you're going into Liberators, it's very difficult to pre-siege your army in the correct locations if you don't know where the army is And you can't just go around scanning all the time because you want to be using MULE So this is why these sensor towers are so extremely, extremely cost-effective, even though it feels like a big investment. But if a little bit of a fight going on, a big scan on top of the army, and honestly, this fight, well, the Planetary Fortress went down very quickly and some zoning storms from the Protoss, but I honestly think this army might be capable of taking on this army Now, as this is going on, there is a run-by into the natural of the Terran The Terran responds with a single Liberator around his Command Center So a lot of workers did get lost there, about 20-ish or so A couple more got lost in this area We were at 71, now we're at 49. So that was a bit of a bad move by the Terran, who now very desperately needs a good fight, right? He has a very big army, sure, his army supply is bigger. There's a couple of issues I have though. There's no 2-2 on the way yet, or no 3-3 on the way yet and he doesn't have a Planetary Fortress, and he doesn't even know where the Protoss army is. So the Protoss gives him the surprise of a lifetime. Even though I'm not sure if this is a good surprise for the Protoss, he doesn't really need the fight right now. This is an okay position, some decent storms coming out, but these EMPs are hitting absolutely everything. And once the High Templar disappear, and your colossus start falling against the Vikings, I mean, Marine Marauder and equal upgrades against pure stalkers, just going to destroy a stalker, immortal army. This is why most people prefer lower Stalker counts, bigger charge slot counts and just kind of keeping your Templar split because the moment this happens the game just kind of ends as we can see right now 121 army supply against 50 army supply and the Terran is definitely in the advantage there now if you're a Terran and you're wondering what to do is just go for the throat you can go for the throat while sending small groups of arrests to other bases perhaps so you can send like you go over here with your main army send eight Marines to the third so you still kill that that that that eco over there. Instead, our Terran opts to go for the fourth base first, zones out his opponent with a couple of Liberators Still has a bunch of Ghosts as well Still no 3-3 on the way And he has a couple more Command Centers This looks really, really good for the Terran, right? I mean, he kills his base for free He scans this army He's like, all right, there's absolutely no way that I can lose this As long as I keep Macroing, that's what he keeps doing Everything is producing We're getting more Liberators sent to our main army, but still no 3-3, which is bothering me a bit. There's another thing that I'm worried about for the Terran is I wouldn't mind seeing a couple of extra Ghosts being at it, maybe going up to six, seven Ghosts at this point, just in case you miss any kind of big EMPs. I also feel like he's a little bit too, too passive. Like he should be way more keen to fight Like this big Archon count against your Ghost, if you just hit your EMPs, this army disappears just like this. There we go Moving forward is the Terran right now. And now this actually looks a little bit scary honestly. This is starting to feel like a bigger army. We get big warp-in after big warp-in as the Protoss was floating a lot of money. But once again Terran succeeds in this goal and will be able to basically just take out this third base for free. Now once again I feel like just moving on top of this army that you just damaged so much probably would be better. Why would you give your opponent the time to remix or to get a lot more units? Especially because at this point you actually are running low on Ghost energy. There's maybe one, two EMPs left in this army. Dealing with Archons is going to be extremely difficult. So after you kill the third base, I'd actually kind of advise going back home now as your army is looking very, very weak here, Mr Terran And let's have a look at how the EMPs land Well, the EMPs don't land because there's no EMPs anymore So right now the Terran actually is being chased back home He still has bigger army supply The problem is his army supply doesn't have enough Ghosts that can EMP It's just really important that he hits his EMP Meanwhile, the Protoss player, who had a bank of about 6K once he lost the third and the fourth, he actually didn't lose that many Probes He's equal worker count He just built two more bases. If he starts reproducing workers right now, it's actually going to be in a pretty okayish spot Now, Mr Terran, who hasn't been playing too poor, I have to admit, he's been doing an okay job except for the early game We need to take a good fight right now We need to take a good fight We're still up in Army Supply. We have five bases up, two planetaries, I mean these are these guys are hard to kill and this army is extremely poor against EMP All you need to do is hit the EMP and the EMP is a radius of about 500 meters at this point So let's see where the EMPs will be hitting first two EMPs completely managed to miss everything Third EMPs also just If there was a maybe a saw a bug over here or something but he surely managed to get that bug in that case and now once again there's no EMPs remaining against an army that I mean this army is completely shield and energy based if you just hit half an EMP on this army it's going to be impossible for the Protoss to win already a couple more ghosts are joining the fray right now and the pro is actually doing a rather good job microing this out some good army movement as well and here is once again why the sensor tower would be so extremely useful because our Terran is completely blind he has no knowledge of anything he's just prepared for an attack at this area and it's like, oh wait a second, you walk to my planetary on the 4th. And this is why I get the Sensor Tower I mean, you can always try to repair, but once there's a couple of immortals, a bunch of Archons, some storms Oh, first with EMP being hit, but another good storm hitting as well So don't forget that at EMP with the enhanced shock wave is so easy to hit and also outranges anything the Templar can do So as long as you have vision of the army, honestly, you should never really get stormed And you should be able to hit some some goody and pieces, you know A Terran has a very, very weak army We also don't have a lot of harass going on I mean, this base has been practically empty without anything. Like one Liberator there would have been able to put in some work Same over here No cannons, no pylons Wouldn't even be able to warp in any Stalkers These are just things where in a scrappy game like this, it's nice to send out a Lib or something Four Libs at home were nice, but one Lib on the other side of the map is probably a lot nicer These are some goodie in peace from our Terran, who also is completely unaware of any kind of run-by happening Like I said, no real vision anywhere on the map I mean, this whole middle area is basically blind This area is blind. And here come a couple of Zealots, which will be going real hard on these two SCVs Does the Depot lift at time? No, Depot does not lift in time So these three Zealots will be going Ham on to those six SCVs that are just idling But this was a big distraction Look at that A complete F2 from our Terran to deal with six. Zealots and here's the main army of the Protoss moving forward, snaking forward, absolutely going hard, very quick movement by this Protoss player and even though it's in the Sensor Tower he still managed to actually check if there was a fourth in there would have been a fourth he definitely would have been able to have it and at this point as a Protoss player you're pretty happy your upper base your army is big but still very vulnerable to EMPs and here we go to EMPs and here we go to EMPs EMPs hitting absolutely nothing One EMP hitting all the Templar, but half of the army is still not really being hit Ah, this feels very good for the Terran Very nice fight. If he just one or two more EMPs on top of this army and he should absolutely be able to win this Yeah, there we go manages to just completely chase it back At the same time though, a little bit of a zealot run-by here will be going hard on those turrets and the refineries These kind of run-bys never do too much anymore Once this base is mined out, you're going to get 3-4 SCVs but sending in 10 zealots for 3 SCVs really isn't the way It also of course distracts the Terran, so that is nice and all And some late EMPs coming in, but this army is so extremely weak Good micro once again out of the Terrans, some nice splits. If you need more Medivac at this point But I actually kind of start to dig the position of the Terran once again. If only he would be able to do something about these bases with either a Liberator, this one for example or a little bit of a drop just any kind of a rest to to pull his opponent apart because sure he's defending very well he's taking he's taking good fights even though 60 70% of the EMPs are being missed I still feel like it could be way way better for him if he just managed to to finally get some momentum on his side and fights where he wants to fight rather than wherever the Protoss wants to fight so once again our Terran getting pulled kind of caught out of position this base will not fall I believe good EMPs but these storms will absolutely end the game I believe I mean there's not enough Medivacs to heal everything here all of these Templar are clumped so there's no real excuse if you have vision of the army to get completely stormed you can just put one EMP on I mean at this point at this point we there's no go so it becomes very difficult but I'm afraid I need to turn on my, what you call it? The swear words. I don't want to see the swear words here, but this is the children-friendly channel. Oh no I mean these storms are just absolutely destructive. Yeah, I just... Ah, our Terran is actually serious. Oh no. A couple High Templar falling now. And our Terran seems to have taken this game rather serious after dancing in the storms for a couple of minutes, dancing in the rain, sitting in the storm. The worst opener I've seen in my life. He did have a lot of nice moves, you know, some of the micro was nice, the unit compositions were good. And he did actually play well. He did play well, but so did the Protoss. The Protoss did play well. And if the Terran was just a little less passive, really went for the throat when he was up, 80, 90 army supplies. There might have been some slight errors there, but it's actually it was kind of a high-level game, which I enjoyed to watch. Protoss was good, Terran was good. However, if we just have a quick summary of the game. First of all, opener of the Terran complete garbage, put him really far behind. Second of all, there was no real way that he tried to come back, except just just being kind of passive with Vikings. Three, his map vision was kind of poor. They have some good fights in the midgame. He had a very good fight in the mid game, but then he decided to not finish the game. Instead. Just going for the outside basis, very slow movement with the army rather than pushing on top of the Protoss player. Really pushing the advantage. And then finally just missing almost all of your EMPs. And that's not easy to hit your EMPs, but it actually is with the enhanced shockwave. Like the radius is so big. You can click anywhere on the screen and it's probably harder to miss something than to hit something. So yeah, I'm sorry, Mr barcode. I know he won't like it. As you, I'm sure you truly believe that you played better and pros are very imba with. You suck. You really just suck. Sorry, man. I don't like this either. All right, boys.

        "text": "What's up, boys, welcome back to a new Is it Imba or do I suck? Today we have a replay from my boy, Harstom's Butt, against Demidar, who is a Terran? Let's turn on the sound as well. As, actually, let's read the email first. First, that's how we're supposed to start. What does it say? Despite some lessons learned from your amazing coaching session, Terran is clearly imbalanced. How else can you lose a game after you easily defend the three rax with a fast third, double forge, amazing harassment and even DT transition? It must be either the matchup that needs fixing or that stupid map, where your aim of command forces your army to split up and choose two routes. That makes it much too easy for Terran to kill half your army Either change the maps in favor of Protoss or remove Ghosts from the game I hope my high-level analysis qualifies me for IOTS Also, my latter name in honor to you is Harshom Butt Nice Fantastic opening statement here by my boy Harstom's Butt who apparently defends the three Barracks perfectly and it still goes on to lose the game Now, if that is the case, that would of course be ridiculous because a three Barracks attack is something you invest heavily in as a Terran. If he actually holds with a third base, good probe count, one one on the way, like he says, his upgrades are on the way, then, I mean, there should be a walk in the park. It's most likely going to be imba, right? Now, let's first start with this pylon. I'm not a massive fan of this. pylon position but if you're going to build a pylon here at least build your Gateway in this location rather than over here you always want your Adept to pop as close to the Reaper as possible and in this case it's over here which means if the Reaper attacks this bottom area your Adept will need to walk all the way over here which take a very long time if you build your Gate over here it's going to be slightly closer which can save you a Probe and it doesn't matter if you wall with a Cybernetics Core or Gateway i also actually don't believe this is a complete wall i think there's still one here so poor job with the wall there Mr. Harsden's bot and we see our opponent is opening with a gasless expand now the moment our Protoss player will scout this he should know the timing it's like hey wait this CC is way too fast this can only be a gasless expand and I think he does realize as he immediately goes back without even scouting the gases here now what can you do after you scout that there's no gas for your opponent It means that there will be no Reaper on your side of the map, which means your first unit should make its way straight across the map, to scout, to try and do some harassment, force out the bunker. You don't need to Chronoboost out your second Gateway unit either, because still there won't be a Reaper, which means you can just Chronoboost probes, be a little more economical, and put on some pressure with that first Adept, that first Stalker Only the first unit will be Chronoboost the second one won't be So we open with a Stalker this time around, which is fine as well I don't mind that honestly As long as he sends it straight across the map and does not Chronoboost the second unit, I'm going to be a happy camper What is this? Puts the Probe in it This, first of all, is a pretty bad location for a Robotics Facility, which is why I didn't really like this Pylon. The reason for that is, if a drop would enter, were to enter this base, this pylon and this side is most exposed, which is why I would always build my buildings over here I built my first pylon here Like you're a lot less exposed if the drop comes in from this, area, which is most likely where the drop will come from, if all your buildings are over here, harder to unpower So always keep in mind that you want to build your important tech structures away from your cliff's edge, always away from your cliff edge or away from the spot that is most likely to be dropped. Now, we do have a probe that won't be mining anymore for the rest of the game most likely, as it's locked up between a Gateway, a Cybernetics Core and a Robotics Facility. We're keeping our stalker at home, which is not too great. I see Harvestrom's Brut is actually opening up with a Robotics Facility into Twilight Council. So this is just a blink play. And I'm kind of happy with that. I'm glad to see that. You get the quick Robotics Facility for scouting. You get the Twilight Council for the blink later on. You can harass a little bit with blink perhaps. These buildings aren't too great. They're not very useful. It's not a wall in the front. And they're not in a safe location either. And it kind of blocks your army movement as well, trying to go into your own natural. Not a massive fan of that, but so far, Harkstom's what is playing pretty all right. Build order is being executed tightly. See some Chrono Boost on top of that blink. Not necessary because, once again, we scouted the lack of gas early on, which means if it's going to be a factory, it's going to be a very delayed factory, which in turn means that any kind of harassment will be later. No need for this Chrono Boost on top of the blink. For some reason, we have a probe cut here at 39. I'm not aware of this probe cut. I know this build very well, but your probe cut usually starts the moment you hit full mineral saturation on your third base I'm starting to suspect that Harstams-Bow did not read the signs correctly and thought he was playing against just a regular gas expand, so a Barracks gas perhaps So he is very prepared for some kind of drop Now, this just means that at this point, he's behind because he hasn't been producing workers Terran is even in worker count, and we see the income is about 300 ahead or 200 ahead for the Terran, which is actually kind of big You want to be up five, six workers against Terran always Not mining properly from this base is also very big. We have another war pin, even though we just scouted exactly what's going on So we see three Barracks and we're like, hey, he's probably going to push at some point, but not yet Because, you know, he doesn't have enough units for that We should definitely be getting more workers But instead, we stay on a very low worker count And one scan in the bottom here, you can really see the difference in income because the moment you have even more workers, the MULEs will just destroy you Like, they just get more income for the Terran He has two Orbitals Look at that Four or 500 minerals more per minute. On top of that, we lose what? Two Stalkers for three? Two Stalkers and a Probe are down for free already, which will make it harder for us to stop to harass. Imagine if we had six Stalkers here, probably would be able to target down one or two Marines. I mean, he still managed to force out the stim, which is good, but then doesn't run away. So he will lose another Stalker, doesn't get anything. Three Stalkers lost, and all he really did was force out the stim. On top of that, no Forge on the way yet, we're actually downing workers at this point. Charge hasn't started. There's plenty of army to deal with the three Barracks. I agree with that. Plenty of army to deal with that But even if the Terran in this case will lose his complete army, it still is kind of okay for the Terran He's been mining four or five hundred minerals more for the past minute and a half, two minutes This whole army might be worth about 1,200 resources, maybe slightly more, maybe slightly less So if you have two and a half, three minutes of mining 400 less, it's basically an even game On top of that, ProDolz isn't getting any extra infrastructure, no extra forges, no extra gates So Terran will get a lead in upgrades and still has a lead in economy and basically is even in the amount of resources they have compared with units. If you would lose absolutely everything without killing a single unit But I mean, this is a sizable army Terran would go back at this point, this game would be practically over Protoss would be like 90% dead No way you can win anymore Because you need worker production You just need more workers So Guardian Shield is being used Zealots in the back Immortal will start tanking the Marine Marauder fire, and one Immortal does go down So even though in the end for the unit loss table, it might kind of even up after the Stalker losses This whole trade that the Terran had was a fantastic trade I mean, unit lost actually is still in favor of Terran Terran has been mining more Third CC. C is done. He's up and upgrade. If I was a Terran player, I'd be pretty happy with this, honestly. And even though you can say, hey, wait a second, there's like way more supply for the Protoss here. Sure, that's true. But look at his infrastructure. He's building off of three gateways. He's adding two extra now, but he needs to be going up to six, seven, eight gateways at this point. 1-1 finally starts, which is nice. And he has some safety so he can finally probe up. But I think in a minute or a minute and a half when Terran's infrastructure really gets online, he's going to just be able to even up the supply relatively easily or even pull ahead. So even though the Protoss believed that he was very far ahead after the start, he actually doesn't have much of an opportunity for anything at this point. And Terran is actually in a completely fine spot, I believe. Some good chasing here by the Terran. We'll be able to take out those Stalkers. Still no extra gases for the Protoss. So, Protoss, once again, kind of high in supply, but the supply he has is kind of bad. It's consisting of mainly Zealots, low worker count. Finally, gases are coming online. There's no Templar Archives yet. Finally, Stargate. There's no fourth base, which means at the moment that Terran will get these extra gases. Terran will be looking at a pretty sizable economy lead once again. As we see, this MULE putting on some real work, pushing up the Terran income, to 35, 3,400, almost consistently Warp Prism does come out, once again I think at this point, a fourth base would be appropriate Storm, a couple of Templars, 2-2 should be on the way, and then going into 7 to 8 gas as fast as possible, so you can afford a Colossus switch Another thing that the Protoss isn't doing is that he isn't really using his army lead that he has been having for the past, well, four or five minutes, three, four minutes maybe, to gain some extra map control with his army So this army could be on the map while a Warp Prism is here, and that could scare the Terran. You know, it could be maybe try to fight the main army, and then your Warp Prism will be able to do a lot of damage in the main base However, we only see a Warp Prism starting now And I feel like the Protoss is kind of not using the only lead he had, which is the army lead I guess a little bit of a economy lead as well We see second Starport coming out of the Terran as well as 2-2 starting So upgrades are completely equal Terran doesn't really need to fight this army He sees like 30 Zealots or, well, 21 Zealots He's like, you know what? I think I'm just going to go home. Try again later on when I have a couple of Ghosts. Maybe one, two-two upgrades, a couple of Vikings with my army as well. And I think Terran seeing this, an army quality that consists of mainly zealot-stalker and one Immortal and not seeing a fourth base, as a Terran you're going to be kind of happy. Like you're going to be like, oh, that's cool. You know, that's really cool. As long as I don't lose my army right now, as long as I don't take a bad trade, I'm going to be completely fine. So Terran just continues expanding. Should probably add a Barracks or so and get two-two started rather than just plus two attack. And this fight is very weird by the Protoss player He's just going in with the Zealots for now Then the rest of the army will join, but Terran can start kind of to the left side And this was a very costly engagement here for the Protoss Unless he managed to get all of these Medivacs and the whole bio army I think this actually was a really bad trade Terran, even though he's floating 1400 minerals, is actually pulling pretty far ahead in the supply count as well right now Combined that with a fourth base being done, Protoss' fourth base just starting I'm starting to like the Terran's position more and more The moment he macroses up a little bit, just really gets everything going. He should be completely fine in this game, honestly here we finally have that the double Robotics Facility switch but we can't really support it with the gas count that we're on right now like we want to be getting Templar we want to be getting upgrades soon as well i mean we're currently still on 1-1 we want to definitely get plus 2 attack started but we only have 200 gas in the bank we're still on 5 gas we haven't taken this this gas yet we haven't taken any of these gases and worker count of 68 isn't too bad usually you're on 4 bases you want to go up to 75 76 workers to comfortably mine from eight gases. Now, the one thing I got to complement our Protoss for is his map vision is absolutely fantastic He has pylon spread all over the map He has unit spread all over the map I would love to see an observer here, or an observer here, and I would love to see this tower being taken, and just a Zealot at this tower as well You can kind of battle for vision of this tower, but in general, a Protoss should be able to get that kind of vision that you, you know, if you want it, just send a Zealot there just send a Zealot there Zealots are stronger than Marines at one-on-one, so it should be fine Now Dark Shrine gets added on top of that. I'm really not a fan of this because once again his gas is so low already. He can't... What he's building Adepts? Why is he building six Adepts? What? It's not even Glaives. That makes absolutely not... This is just bad, honestly. This makes no sense. Yeah, he just doesn't have the gas. So you see he builds one Colossus at a time right now. He can't even afford Thermal Lance yet. Probably will start a second Colossus before that. Extra gas is being added was going so slow. You really need to be going up to eight gas. 76 workers is good, but you need to use those workers appropriately and you definitely should be pushing some workers into those extra gases. You see the Colossus switch is just going to be so slow Usually as a Protoss player, what you want to be one tech ahead So in this case, our opponent only has Ghost as a special tag and the Protoss only has Templar as a special tag, which means in this case those will be good fights for the Terran most of the time If the Terran gets Ghosts and Viking, and Protoss has only Templar and Colossus, once again that should be good for the Terran Only when Protoss is a tag ahead, so imagine you get Disruptor Templar and Colossus or mass immortal Templar Colossus, then you should be able to fight a Ghost Viking army. Or maybe you can get Fleet Beacon and Tempest and Templar and Colossus, just always be one tech ahead of your opponent So when your opponent has two, you get a third, when your opponent has three, you get a fourth That's kind of how you want to be fighting, but you never want to be fighting on equal tech if you also have equal or worse upgrades. And in this case also, kind of just a worse army supply because 77 workers is very good for the Protoss, but the Terran workers supply just means that his army is going to be absolutely massive. Combine that with the fact that these upgrades actually look a little healthier and his army just looks way scarier than what the Protoss has. So the Protoss', because of that complete lack of gas, these two extra gases we see what? Two, three Colossus without Thermal Lance by the way. 3-3 finally starting, Dark Shrine which will probably never be used. So I guess maybe this run by but shouldn't really do anything. Um this army isn't scary to fight against right? Like where are the Templar? There's four Templar over here. I mean, four High Templar in theories enough Maybe you want to get a couple more, but you really want to be more comfortable with gas This is a bad fight to just straight up walk into Your High Templars aren't with your army Your Colossus don't have range Your upgrades are still being researched There's three upgrades on the way And he already just bled out two Colossus basically So once these High Templars join the fight, maybe he can try to push this back, but you should never try to engage into this terrible storms being thrown as well First good EMP gets hit, but once again, like he's down in tech, he's down in army, and he's down in upgrades as well as the Terran has plus three. There's so many Vikings to deal with the Colossus and goes just EMP absolutely everything I mean, there's no way in hell you're going to win a fight like this Scan to basically show the DTs and Demidar is in such a good position right now It becomes so difficult as a Protoss to deal with that And it's really just because that complete lack of gas, The lack of upgrades he had here and honestly kind of the poor decision making to walking into a fight as you're still researching three different upgrades Your Templar ending position Oh, we actually get a GG well played It's rare in the PvT that we see a GG, but today we have one So, yeah, the verdict. The early game wasn't too hot. Too little Probes. Forges too late. Too late Fourth Base. Gases are too late. Transition into Colossus was way too slow. The timing of going in with the Warp Prism was kind of bad. No rule run by it into the third base, which is the most vulnerable base. No Warp Prisms into the main. Do I need to continue? I think we all know the answer. You suck. It's the way of the world, my friend. It's the way of the world. All right, boys. Thanks everyone for watching this Is it Imba or do I suck?

        "text": "What's up friends and family and other creatures from the sea? Today we have another Is it Imba or do I suck? And today's email reads There's nothing worse than losing to a sky toss That is mainly because of this feeling of helplessness I get each time I see a fleet of Carriers flying across the map to annihilate me It seems like no matter what army composition I have, there's practically no chances for me Not that the Carriers is the only Protoss unit that really makes me sad, but this game is a good example when it comes to them I had a full limit of new patched Thors and Vikings, and he almost didn't notice my army. What other units could I build? It is doubtful that perfect EMPs and Armor Missiles would help in any way. I was watching Hero Marine stream the other day, and he said that TVP almost makes him want to quit playing Starcraft 2. I know I shouldn't relate to him that much since I'm only at 3,500 MMR, and he is like 6,500. But still, maybe in the end of the day, Protoss race is overpowered. It just feels that they always get it easier. No name. And then we open the replay. We take our positions. We see today's subject is called Coombrain. Well, Mr Coombrain, let's investigate that claim, eh? So the main issue seems to you with air units. Now, I must admit I've heard every single complaint about Protoss in my time from Terran Zealot is too strong Zealot is too fast Zealot has too much HP Zealot is too cheap Zealot is not enough supply Adept is too strong It's too fast Too much supply with every single unit, except perhaps the Carrier So I'm curious to see how this Protoss managed to get, first of all, into Carriers and then did anything Now, this Protoss, I know I don't want to make it a habit to criticize the person who didn't send in the replay, but we open up with a Forge first into Gateway This is a build I've never seen before into a proxy Pylon that immediately gets spotted as well. So I'm just extremely curious what's going to happen here. It's two cannons. No Cybernetics Core yet. Another response of our Terran seems decently reasonable. In general against Cannon Rush, if he doesn't get the high ground, I'd always recommend a Reaper, right? You send a Reaper across the map. You have good chances to do some damage because the Cybernetics Core is most likely delayed. Reaper usually arrives at 2 30. Well, the Reaper would have about 30 seconds without any unit there. No cannons being built here either. So that would have been a first word of advice I could give, but I don't mind the Marine as much either. I mean, it's a relatively okay choice. Now, double gas, no CC. I guess you get a Tank against this in this case can also get something else but yeah Tank this is all extremely reasonable i i don't mind this there's a Stalker at home a Stargate at home now of course a scan once again the reaper could have done this but i don't even mind it all too much one of the many adventures that Terran has is they can build their CC on the high ground and be completely fine against this kind of play like he already could have had this one done earlier as well. Now the moment you get a Tank you want to start shelling away at these cannons so it's important to get vision. Now you can get vision by for example sending a Marine down or not. Too sure about floating the Barracks especially not keeping it in range and then ideally you'd target the Shield Batteries first instead of the Photon Cannons but this is all very fine. You could also use the Cyclone to lock on to one of the buildings to kill it faster. That also would be rather helpful. But I think just sending a Reaper as a start would have pretty much won him the game almost immediately filled like four or five workers probably. Now we're floating 600 minerals and we're moving out with our Command Center to this location as we're cleaning up this our just normal regular natural location. We don't really have any scouting information on our opponent. We know there's a Stargate but nothing else. It's been five minutes in game. We haven't seen anything. We are ready for our Oracles. We have two Vikings at home. And this is a secondary Starport. It's going to be a long day in the office today, boys. Yeah, two Starports. 1,100 minerals in the bank. We could throw down two or three Command Centers, I guess. But for some reason, mass Viking is the way forward. I'm not entirely sure why. We still have no info. This could still be a one base all in. Like there could be six Void Rays waiting here. Could also already have four bases. I have absolutely no clue. Transferring workers to this base and going into double gas The logic of this base still kind of, you know, if you're going to take a base, why not this one? as a more natural third base, straight into fusion core And a tech lab, so I'm assuming Battlecruisers But then what is the second starport for? Maybe Arterran isn't aware that he can swap buildings so he could just lift this one up and build a tech lab and then get, instead of having to build a secondary starport, just gets a fusion core and starts a Raven Continuous Cyclone production Still floating 900 minerals. Our Protoss, meanwhile, his build didn't make any sense, but his micro and macro like a god, like constantly below 300 minerals. This build doesn't make a lot of sense, but for what he's doing, it kind of makes sense, you know, saving up Carriers. Well, as our Terran spots the Fleet Beacon. The response is more Starports. Now, usually the way to beat Carriers is just to play regular Bio, honestly if you just play a three Barracks build you get a couple of mines you can forever deny a third base then you just do a one one push with Ghost or you go even go into two two you get Ghost and you get double Starport Viking and at that point most of the time you just win as the moment Carriers are out of interceptors which i very quickly against Marines they are kind of useless honestly in low numbers Carriers really freaking suck so you can deny a third base forever if you let Protoss get into Carriers for free while you're I mean down a base and building an army composition without any upgrades whatsoever, then yeah, it's probably gonna get a little bit harder. Now I have to admit both players are doing a fantastic job denying themselves all information. So far our other Protoss really knows is that there is a Barracks and a Bunker. And all our Terran really knows, actually Terran does know there's a third base with the scans. He put three scans on the other side of the map. He knows there's Carriers on the way. He knows there's three bases. So he knows he's on equal footing with this Protoss. And he knows the army composition. Our Protoss doesn't really care. He's like, you know what? I'm just building Carriers. I'm upgrading. Just let me be me all right. First, more Vikings as well as Yamato cannon for the Battlecruisers. So I'm very glad we got this Fusion Core, so we can boost out more Vikings. A second Factory is being built. This is way too many production structures. It's way too heavy in gas for three bases, right? Like all of these are just producing exclusively gas units. It's simply not possible. Now, we're lowering our mineral count extremely quickly. And also our gas count is going down very fast, because we have so many production structures. A Tech Lab on a Factory gets put down again. And a Tech Lab on a Barracks. Um, yeah, this is, I, it's very difficult for me to give, uh, any analysis of this game because I have never seen something like this before. It's, it's like, yeah, is like, yeah, is like a completely foreign concept, how both players are playing We now see a move out with four Cyclones and a lot of Vikings, which in my mind should be enough to clear these Carriers, has to, uh, There's seven Carriers now and the Carriers do have plus one Plus two is on the way There's a couple of Shield Batteries So perhaps our Terrans, our Protoss might be able to defend, but he doesn't seem to be too keen on that Now, let's take a look at the focus fire Whenever you have Vikings against Carriers, you want to focus fire on the Carriers and not the interceptors He's doing a good job. Didn't use a single missile from the Raven, which would have helped But just kind of gets a move I guess that's what you get if there's carriers in Shield Batteries I actually didn't know how this fight was going to go I'm going to be real with you, boys Like, this could have gone either way for me because this is a fight I actually never see in my life Like pure Viking versus pure carrier So, yeah, it's just really the unit composition that is lacking from the Terran here And just the complete lack of upgrades The plus one helps a lot, of course, for carriers. And armor upgrades are extremely useful in this case for the Vikings, or just any kind of upgrades would be useful for the Vikings at this point. Now we get two more factories. I assume that's going to be the Thors. We have a single Battlecruiser with a single Yamato. And once again, we're flooding 1,300 minerals for no real reason. which is also quite impressive, given how many production structures we have. Like, with a single click of the button, like, if you just hold down the V button for one and a half second, like, you'll be spending all this money straight into Vikings, which probably isn't the unit you want, but at least you're spending your money. Meanwhile, our Protoss player is. This guy is truly playing single player. Both players are kind of playing single player. But at least the Coombrain is. He's responding a bit. But he's responding rather poorly. As we have a Planetary Fortress on the way. Which is interesting. And probably a good call. I wouldn't mind seeing like three extra bases. With the money that we have. Just expand all over the map. Like this guy is definitely not planning on moving out. Just going to build carriers and sit. He is getting very good upgrades has double Cybernetics Core, has a Forge, even build a Twilight Council so he can continue upgrades. So right now we're on 1-1 already and soon to be 2-1-2 against just a plus-1 armor upgrade Now, that's of course very good for the Protoss player, who also is taking a fort So they're expanding at a similar pace The Toss won the first fight, but maybe the Terran can still win the second fight Now, against Carriers, once again I said, I think Vikings very good I think with Mech it's also possible to beat Just get a bunch of Thors, like really a big Thor count, good upgrades If you really want, eventually you can add EMPs But if it's just pure carrier, you don't actually need it, I think Maybe if they add in Immortal Chargelot or something like that, you will. But if you have well-upgraded Thors against mass Carriers, I'm pretty sure you win. Like, I haven't played that too much, but I had it once or twice, and the Thors seem extremely powerful, especially if you have them in combination with Ghosts. It makes it so much easier. We're not a massive fan of the Vikings, especially because he isn't really getting ship weapon upgrades whatsoever. And we have the two Stalker sacrifice. So this is the first time I believe, yeah, our Protoss moved across the map. Still not aware of how many bases there is, but some good info on what kind of army our opponent has. And as a response, of course, the Protoss continues building carriers, as he's been doing for the past nine minutes now. We see our Terran is going up to six Thors, builds three more, nine Thors. The only thing really lacking here is the upgrades. Like I don't mind the army too much. It's just he's flowing so much money constantly, and he started his upgrade so late that the Protoss is just really far ahead upgrade-wise. Like he's, I'm not great at counting, but this is up three upgrades at this point. And he's getting three upgrades at the time. Well, the Terran forgets to start his plus two Armor. I'm actually not quite sure what the Terran is doing. Currently nothing. He just had zero APM, just scratching his head. Yeah, just not doing anything at the moment. Neither is the Protoss though. This is fantastic to watch. It's just mesmerizing to see the moves here. As we finally start the plus two and double Robotics Facility get started. Okay, so Protoss is like, you know what, I want to counter his unit composition and Immortal seemed like a reasonable choice. I agree with that. Now, the Terran, I feel like, needs to realize that Ghosts are very useful. Ghost basically cuts the HP of his opponent down 33%, real fast, which is a powerful ability, of course. So if you have an ability like that, why would you not use it? Especially with the amount of cash that this guy is saving, when he's preparing for the apocalypse or something Like 5K, 1K in the bag Slowly but surely getting some extra upgrades The plus 2 has started But once again, ProD is very far ahead I can't believe how little things are happening in this game So we see the good old scouting Mothership Is this real? I'm not sure what they follow A scan on top of his own army in case there's an observer It's a reasonable play This is just This has to be the best game I've seen so far and is it Imba or do I suck Confirms where the army is The Terran scans again, making sure that it really was just a scouting Mothership. It doesn't really continue any upgrades Like, damn, I have a lot of money Let me add three, four, five more Factories Which is a wise call, actually I don't mind that But I also wouldn't mind getting extra upgrades. extra upgrades that really is a big issue right now we have 1-1 upgrades against 3-2-2 so before this fight let's just quickly say he's up one one four upgrades right now the Protoss so usually if you're up for upgrades you win the majority of the fights now we see the Thors are putting in some works the Vikings are not completely target firing on the on the on the Carriers all right now they're just following the interceptors which is the incorrect call and this fight was an absolute massacre massacre I'm actually surprised how much it was lost here like basically the Terran was down four upgrades didn't really focus fire at all still killed I think three or four Carriers maybe even more maybe five it's not bad the Terran here I mean he's gonna die very painful that soon I can only assume, no? Our PTITDROGO is getting very close to being maxed out. After confirming with the mothership where his opponent's location was, he Yeah, he just kind of A-moved across the map and killed him I can understand why this is very frustrating for the Terran, but I think there were some small things he could have done better, like the upgrades, the constant floating of money, perhaps could have gotten some Missile Turrets, improve the army composition, either with a Raven or with some Ghosts Carriers are difficult to fight if there's High Templars underneath, but without High Templars, it's just carrier, you can just kind of kill them, I think, especially if you focus fire on them Oh no, we're going to have another try here, where our boy Coombrain is. So he moves forward, starts targeting some interceptors down Oxtoos is very, very afraid of this Oh, but the mothership is on its way back and I guess that will be the end be the end for our boy Coombrain, who has no production left Once upon a time he did have eight factories, but that time is well behind us As one more scan reveals that indeed, the scouting mothership has returned Yeah A couple more carriers make their way across the map, and Coonbrain is trying his hardest, producing more and more SCVs No extra production facilities, because that would be foolish Of course It might actually get a chance to win in that case. If you use some of that money that he has in the bank The Armory sadly, most likely will get killed before 3-2 finishes Meanwhile, our Protoss on 3-333 For like the past few minutes No G G gets called and Sargon R wins. You suck I'm sorry, man. Didn't build a Reaper initially to stop the cannon rush Didn't put any pressure on your opponent Played an awful composition blindly, double Starport, constantly floating money No upgrades Bad micro in the fights Bad army composition No Missile Turrets. They already mentioned slow at expanding Eight things you can improve on You really suck this game, buddy I don't know. I'm sorry It's the way it is, boys All right.

        "description": "In todays episode of \"Is it Imba or do I suck?\" we have a grandmaster/master 1 player send in his replay where he loses to a viper hydra lurker player.This can ofcourse be only due to 1 reason: ZERG IS BROKEN!!Or is there more than meets the eye? Find out right now!",
        "video_id": "50vUPiXkMWE",
        "text": "Well, it's our boys, welcome back to a new Is it Imba or do I suck? And today we'll be looking at Peacekeeper, who is a Master 1 slash Grandmaster player. We're playing against Rook Mackintech, who I do know. He's a bit of a streamer and he's a Grandmaster on the American server. Now, let's actually have a look of the email of Peacekeeper, of course, as we always shoot. 22 minutes of a PvZ, it's reddddickety-year. How good Hydra Lurker Viper can trade versus literally everything, even Skytoss, seriously, 10 range on Lurkers. You can't feed back the Vipers if your HT instantly dies to Lurkers. Master 1 GM. Fantastic. Alright. Let's get into it then. This is probably the highest level game we have done so far on Is It Imba or Do I Suck? There's some actual Grandmasters involved. My sound is on. The graphics are all tuned up. I think we're ready to help solve this mystery: is Hydra Lurker Viper actually completely broken or this peacekeeper just suck a little bit Now I do have to note that I believe Mac and Tech is about 150 MMR higher, but that might of course be because this race is simply better It might have nothing to do with actual imbalance The openings look very standard I mean, these guys know exactly what they're doing, so we're not going to focus too much. on that just see some standard Pylons going down some Adepts being Chrono Boosted and all that Mackintech is leaving his Overlord over here checking what the first unit is might go in if he sees no Chrono Boost on the second unit no probably should have but he doesn't and we see peacekeeper with a double Adept most likely into a Phoenix follow now let's take a quick look at the Adept movement decides to attack the Hatchery for a bit so ideally you want to scout the Lair with one shade, that's exactly what he does, and then maybe go for the Drones, the next shade, so you can see if he's actually building Drones or Lings or something like that. Now something that's a bit older is that he played double Adept into Oracle, it means that you don't have anything to deny the Overlord He will of course go Phoenix after But this is just a slight variation, honestly nothing big here And double gas is going down He's playing a good game so far honestly Very tight build order Hitting his Chrono Boost, hitting his timings Let's see what his Oracle will do I don't like his flying movement very much Usually you just poke into one base, not into both Took some real damage for that Now he will be going here We'll manage to get two workers Yeah, Macintech doesn't respond And the Oracle gets away. So this is a pretty good damage for the first Oracle Now we have a Forge twice Twilight follow-up Does he start with an Observer? I assume? Observer, third base Oh, this is kind of nasty Yeah, this is why you always keep your Oracle with your first step It's really important So this is kind of the first mistake This should have been way smoother So ideally with this kind of opener, usually you get your base at around 420 If you get Forge Twilight before, perhaps 4 30 So this base is already extremely late Now, as a round of a very, responds to him losing his first rope, he threw down four Gateways, but he immediately got scouted by an Overlord. So I doubt this will do very much, honestly. We're also not seeing any Immortal production, which is kind of unsafe against any early kind of roach bust. Let me do see Immortal now. It's a little late. Sentries are late, so our info is going to be delayed because we don't have any hallucination scout. But honestly, he's playing a fine game so far, you know? Adepts, this is dicey, but he managed to get back into a good position together with the Oracle. This actually turned out pretty all right. So I think he's actually in a pretty fine spot. Now a couple of points is that he hasn't really been producing workers at all. Instead of producing workers, he's built four Sentries. I believe he went up to eight gates already, which is very early 8 gate, but it simply means he has no workers. Now his opponent kind of realizes that and starts producing roaches as a response to this most likely. I think Macintech could have droned up a bit harder, but I mean this is looking a lot like a push to me as well. Like this is just an 8 gate. It's going to hit most likely with plus one and charge and try to do some damage. Now, I'm not a massive fan of this. Of course, this is very aggressive. And if scouted well, the Zerg usually gets out ahead. I think the Zerg is doing a good job scouting and reacting to everything. Now what I don't understand is that we're seeing a second Robotics Facility over here and a cannon and a Phoenix. Because this is kind... this makes no sense. Like he's been preparing for a big attack. He's built what, six Sentries? That's a lot of gas. Usually you only get two with this kind of army. You need to attack if you're not attacking with Sentries, and you cut Probes for like two minutes. Like that's really bad. His gases compared to a regular build order are almost a minute late. That's really, really late. That's like 200 gas you just threw down the drain. This base should have been fully saturated if he wasn't going for an 8 gate. He cut so many workers to throw down these Gateways and I was going into Storm and plus two. It's adding another Robo. So he should have been light years ahead in economy, but instead he decided to go for like these six Sentries are completely useless at this point, right? Like Sentries are really really bad. They're good to have two or three of them, but not more than that in PvZ. Because either Ravagers destroy them, Lurkers destroy them, your own Archons destroy them. Losing that Oracle is extremely painful as well. You always want to be able to know where your opponent is. Now, on top of that, if we take a look at what Peacekeeper knows, is he knows some stuff. He's aware of the tech. He's aware of how many base there are. He sees these two gases, so he knows it's going to be eight gas. The problem I have is that he has no map vision whatsoever. So if we take a look here, we see, well, basically, no vision except where his army is. So that's an issue. Like, this is good. This is exactly what they needed to do a bit earlier as well. Send out the prism. These are all good moves, honestly. Colossus is not a good move. Colossus are awful if you build them. Yeah, it might as well just quit. Like, it's no use, honestly. Useless unit. You want to be getting immortal charge Archon Storm. Colossus don't really contribute anything to any army that Immortals don't. Storm beats everything that Colossus do, and Immortals are just better than Colossus. Like they're just better. It's easier to transition out of Colossus. Colossus are really expensive. They really delay any kind of follow-up tag. So yeah, I'm definitely not a fan of this. It's a good run by though. But this army composition so far is pretty good garbage. On top of that we haven't really been on the map yet. Like we have an army that's supposed to be on the map with many force fields, maybe try to deny some creep. We don't even have an Observer right now. Once again, because we're lacking vision everywhere, actually we have pretty good vision. Then we were just completely, this guy was, piecekeeper was completely out of position, and let these roaches cancel this Now, losing these roaches obviously isn't the best, but Zerg has a decent enough eco that he can afford to roaches at this way Roaches are not a unit you want to have in your army anyway as a Zerg A roach is kind of like a Colossus It looks nice on paper but in theory it's complete garbage Now we want to be doing harassment with this Warp Prism We want to be transitioning into Skytoss and we definitely don't want to keep producing Colossus as we're going up to four Colossus Like the Colossus dies against every, it's such a bad unit. Like don't build it against her It's fine against Terran Even against Protoss, it has some uses But against Zerg, it's just not good It's a garbage unit Please don't build it The Zerg's getting his Vipers out Zerg doesn't have a lot of map vision either That's okay Protoss is not completely aware of various opponents army is There's still an Oracle with this army, which is nice And now we're going to get a push All right Now, whenever you push as a Protoss, what you want to do is you want to set up harassment as well So we see these two Adepts, we should see a run by here, and the prism should be flying into the main. Because it's very difficult for Zerg to defend multiple areas, especially with a Warp Prism Like, the Warp Prism is only one unit and can keep a lot of units at bay Like, you'll need to put units everywhere to deal with it, and you need to run around And if you get one warping in with the Warp Prism, bam Just like that, whole game can end. Now, is there any storms available? Yeah, we have four or five storms, we have a bunch of Archons, we have the six, six Sentries that don't forget haven't done anything at all this game it's a lot of gas in there and where's our immortals we have four Immortals in here as well and we're attacking in one angle now this is the absolute specialty of the lurker is defending one spot they're great at keeping chokes they're great in a stationary position as long as nothing else is happening on the map the lurker is what the lurker is built for right it's like defending a single position like it's absolutely great So as long as the Protoss keeps moving around his army as one massive ball, that is basically the dream scenario here for the Zerg. So even this, if the Zerg is out of position, that's completely fine because as long as the Protoss has one big army, he can just F2 his complete army to this spot, burrow and be fine. Now, the problem comes here when you're trying to poke in from one angle without anything else happening, is that the Vipers can perhaps start abducting one or two units into the Lurker, and that's when it becomes dangerous. Now we have a good setup here for the Zerg. Protoss should really be, A, should be looking to saturate this fourth base, 12 minute in game, no saturation, no cannons, and should definitely be transitioning into air. There we go. That's a good transition. But this fourth base should be fully saturated already. Fifth base should have started. Maybe here's a better fifth base. Like, natural mined out, main mined out. Third base is, eh, still some minerals left, left but also getting close. So you want two extra bases already at the 12 minute mark of course. Like he's not mining up. Like it's cool that you're doing a push, but this is it looks funny because he's maxed and has a 2K bank. But this is pretty all in actually. Like he needs to do very well in this fight because he only has 500 gas. He doesn't have any extra gas income. Like he needs to do a lot of damage. His opponent is getting way more income, has bigger worker supply as well And once again, are Protoss attacking in a single location? And even if he manages to kill this base, that's completely fine Because Zirk still has a fourth base Like, the Toss is thinking, well, I'm not playing him so hard You know, I'm killing hydras, doing damage, and we almost killed a fifth base But, mate, your fourth base isn't even mining yet Like, you have 16 workers mining four patches Like, you're not doing that well at all, buddy You're not doing that well Now, finally, we have some multitasking going on for a while. A setup at least for a run by towards this base as the Protoss decides it's time to oh my god it just walks it in I guess never mind here's at least a Warp Prism but yeah I mean Lurkers are there should be able to deal with that this is the problem so I thought what he was going to do is he just want to leave these Zealots here and I walk with the main army to this area and that leaves a challenge for the Zerg right needs to split armies what if he doesn't leave enough Lurkers, what if he doesn't send enough Lurkers? Like he could lose. Now instead what the Protoss does is he sends in 12 Zealots, loses them all to lurkers Then after he loses all of those, he sends in the Warp Prism, loses those, kills like three drones, like, oh, he did some nice harassment there And his main army is defending his main ramp, even though he's completely aware the full army is here Should be pushing forward here, at least clearing this creep Clear maybe some spines Send three Zealots over here while you're attacking this place Like there's so many things you can do This Protoss just isn't using them Now, finally the fourth base gets down, but at this point, yeah, look, third is running dry We need a fifth up already at this point. Here we go with the Prism Will we see more multitask? No, no multitask A single Prism flies into a spore as the main army is guarding this area for whatever reason Like Prisms are not easy to deal with for Zerg And this guy isn't using the time Look at this Just standing guarding the ramp Pompi-dompy-pion Oh, moving back and forth Oh, this is great Save at home Like, these guys are made for war Like, this is like building an army and I'm not using it I mean, why are you building the army, mate? This is StarCraft We're not the world peacekeepers here, bro Like, no mutually assured destruction in StarCraft. Like, we just attack when we have an army, you want to destroy our opponent. And we have a some more run. In his mind, the Protoss is doing so many things. He's like, oh, doing run-bys all game long, I'm using my Warp Prism. But technically, he's never actually, or almost never doing multi-prong. He's almost always attacking with one thing. And whether that is a Warp Prism with three Zealots or his main army, it's still only one thing that's happening. Like, this is the first time he's actually putting some pressure onto his opponent while a run-by is happening. And even though this didn't look great, he did take out three Spines, killed a couple of Roaches, and he set himself up for a later run-by, which, honestly at this point, I doubt, will ever come Now, we see these Colossus Let's see if the investment paid off, hey? Colossi with two kills, one with 11 kills, probably Lings These Colossi did absolutely nothing, well, he's the most useless unit in the game Congratulations, I'm happy you build them Lose an Oracle straight into his opponent, Decides once again, fly with his, walk with his entire army towards his opponent, loses two Carriers, into Lurker Hydra This is probably what he thought was very Imba Damn it The Lurkers managed to kill my Hydras, or my Carriers. Now the Zerg is like, you know what? I think I've waited long enough That's just sacrifice half of my army into yours Nice Now the Protoss are like, this guy's fuming and you know it's like, oh man, this guy sucks so much, I can't even control his army I'm doing run by his whole game long and I just lost two carriers earlier for free But I did all the feedbacks as well and, you know, I'm putting a lot of effort into this game my buddy, you're down like 7K, 4K Like, you're going to need some absolutely wonderful fights And, I mean, he's getting them Like, he's getting some really good fights at this point because his opponent doesn't have the supply right now. But he's, I mean, the Protoss is still behind Like, he's just been doing nothing all game He's getting out mined for, like, the past 10 minutes Like, obviously he's going to be in a garbage position So he's finally taking his six base Still on 65 workers, by the way, not the 74 that you actually need Continues adding more Stargates Goes up to eight Stargates, even though he's on 65 workers and has 70 gas in the bank It's not even mining from his fifth base Instead, starts mining from his sixth base Starts building two Colossus again, as these have been working out so great And yeah, the Zerg is like, well, this basically looks pretty exposed, not a single cannon there. And Toss is like, oh my God, I'm out playing him so much Meanwhile, this base has been going, you know, nothing's been happening to this, but there's not a single run by No Warp Prism in the main in the past eight minutes Toss is pretty blind as to what's happening in general As a single Observer in the middle of the map, Army could come from here at this point Toss would have absolutely no idea Army could come from here at this point Toss would have no idea Like there's so many things that could be happening right now and Toss just isn't aware of them So you have a little weird, look at this Zerg, the Corruptor squad This is math. It's Zerg's playing pretty well, honestly It shows in the bank, like he's doing well I wonder what these guys are going to do Now the Protoss is like basically F2ing back home to deal with six Corruptors recalls a part of his army Like if there's one guy that's getting out play there, it's definitely the Protoss who just ran back home to deal with a Corruptor squad Now if the Zerg was slightly quicker, he could have killed this base in the process, but he realized a little bit too late. So a little bit of the, you know, paying attention to one thing syndrome as well, even at Grandmaster level, this happens a lot where they'll think they're multitasking, but actually they're just doing one thing at the same time And he just get in a good position and probably would be able to abduct one or two of these carriers Yep, there we go And I mean, the Zerg doesn't even need to trade properly Like, the Protoss thought that Zerg was trading very efficiently, but it's actually not the case Like, the units lost tab is extremely even The problem is just that the top isn't mining anything Like he's practically been on four base. Like even though he has had six bases at some point, he's been mining from four for 20 minutes The Zerg's work account isn't that high anymore and he's actually been losing fights a little bit as well Like this army is extremely cost effective The problem is just that he isn't mining at all our Protoss player and he's not really doing any harassment either So yikes As we continue on, we have our Zerg player who is also running out of bank And we have our Protoss player who's starting to run dry as well, but he's feeling at our Protoss player You can see it, you know, I was like, oh, this went well, the last few fights he killed some units Here he goes. With the Zerg run by into Brood Lords, there's a lot of carriers here It's like, alright, this is it, boys How many Corruptors can there really be well? There's 20 Corruptors You have 10 Carriers In theory, this sounds pretty all right, but in actuality, if there's no Void Rays or Archons, you're just going to lose a lot of your Carriers Because Corruptors trade really well against pure Carrier And this is why you always need to get either some Void Rays or some Archons with your army And this trade was pretty cost-efficient for the Zerg And a cost-efficient trade for the Zerg, who still had a 2K-2K bank, against the Protoss who didn't have a bank, is always going to be good, of course. So there's another remix coming with 12 Corruptors There's still Broodlords alive These Corruptors will just be able to target down the Carriers And I'm honestly expecting an angry message from the Protoss at any point now Like what is going to happen here, you know? The mining isn't enough from the Protoss His army isn't good enough And once these 12 Corruptors pop, I do believe all the Carriers will go down There's still Vipers Like this, this Zerg has been microing pretty well, honestly This guy's pretty cool He does kill one of his own Extractors And then he's like, you know what? I think I've waited long enough Just going to go in, snip your Carriers. Not sure how great of a move that is, but once the new Corruptors join, I'm looking for it Oh, an actual GG by Peacekeeper Well, Peacekeeper You didn't multitask once You were basically on four base in a 21-minute game Your force started mining at the 15-minute mark Your armor control is pretty decent and I'll give you that But you built Colossus, so your army sucked There was no Archons Like army composition wasn't great The multitasking was non-existent What else was there? Yeah, and the mining Just not sufficient mine You just got outmined all game I love to tell you that Hydralisk Lurker Viper is broken, but I think the reality of the case here, my friend, is that you suck it boys please subscribe to me leave a like and comment down below see you boys next time bye bye."

        "text": "What's up everyone, welcome back to a new episode of Is It Imba or Do I Suck? Today we're following Destiny, who sent me an email: I heard some I like your videos Nice, that's a good start. In these two replays, I always felt like I out macro my Zerg opponents, but sometimes still lose to their Hydra and then Lurker later on. I always scout everything and react and chrono my Planetary Fortress whenever I can. I know first replay my Storm and upgrade was late, but I played really cautious. The opponent took forever to take his third and did not attack me. I even killed 12 workers. Then I lost a pure Hydra. All right. Well, we're going to be looking at that first replay. So that's the only part that is really important. He did say, it always seems like I cannot outproduce my income and always floated minerals. Thanks for the videos. And he also wonders how many gates he needs. So the problem here is Hydra OP, as it also says in the title. We're going to have a look at this one, Mr Destiny who's playing against Shadow Water is missing a W so it's either Shadow Ater or Shadow without W water. Well just called him Shadow. So Destiny against Shadow. Destiny is just opening with a very standard looking one gate expand and Shadow just opening with also kind of looking standard two base play. Should be going into a third base soon after the Lings hit the field. Now we have a Stargate opener which is the most common one and probably the best opener in my opinion as well. And an Adept into a stalker. Who is this Adept up to? I decided to go back home. Maybe afraid of some kind of all in like, ah okay so he doesn't scout a third base and he's like, hey, that's weird. That's weird. You know, I'm just... What? Wait. Okay, so he scouts the lack of a third base. I thought his response was gonna be, I'm gonna go back home, finish my wall because it might be like a Ling flood or something like that. I did not expect an Adept Stalker move out into a third base at 3:15, into a Void Ray If this was a Ling flood, this game would be completely over already. Usually if you don't scout a natural, what you want to do is just play very cautious or not a natural if you don't scout a third base from the Zerg you want to play very cautious like get your wall up as soon as possible and then with the first unit you get from your Stargate preferably an Oracle you scout across the map to see exactly what he's doing maybe try and get some damage done we do see a Lair tech here from shadow was also going into a Roach Warren now honestly if destiny survives here it's going to be in a really good spot like he's basically up a base like his base started about a minute and a half faster than it usually does which thumbs up for that my friend i like it that's a big play um yeah shadows just going to be kind of far behind he's also playing two base so in a usual situation if destiny managed to survive with an opening like this he would be in a very good spot but now he's playing against a guy who's just you know basically down a full base from the the four minute mark on so So as long as he survives for the next minute and a half, I think he's going to be in a very good spot. Destiny, that is He is, uh, his Void Ray did get a single Overlord kill His Oracle's going to be able to get some information as well These Shield Batteries, I kind of understand them, but the problem is he shouldn't have opened a Void Ray So a Void Ray isn't quite as good at scouting what his opponent is doing And if you're playing against someone that's on two base, you want to scout as fast as possible Like, in the eyes of destiny, this could still be anything Don't forget, he has no info, doesn't have a tower, no map vision Like, for all he knows, his opponent could have been massing Lings on 26 Drones You know, he hasn't seen any Drone count. He hasn't seen a third base And he's just floating around with this Void Ray that isn't really doing anything at this point Not even really in a good defensive position either And the follow-up is Double-Forge once again This is done completely blind I'm still also could be a Nydus, two-based Nydus, a swarm host, or just two-based Roach, queen Nydus, anything like that, but there's no scouting whatsoever, which is really bad Another nice supply block I think it's the second or third one that I've seen so far already Also, no scouting whatsoever with the Adept Now finally, we have two Oracles going across the map And even though Destiny hasn't scouted anything, he's been getting. extremely lucky, right? Like, he's playing against a Zerg player that decided to not take a third base until the five minute mark, and then just slowly drone up while getting double upgrades Now, this is not a build order, and it's not very good If you're a Zerg player, I would not recommend this And Destiny would have died against every single all-in that the Zerg possibly could have done, but instead this Zerg is just playing a weird macro variation So as a result, in combination with the what is this? unit kills, 13 worker kills that he got He's just really far ahead right now He's up 20 workers in a PvZ He has double forges, which he can start researching from any moment now. He's getting a Templar Archives against a Hydralisk composition. Like, this is honestly as good as it's going to get. Like, I feel like at this point, destiny will have to work harder to lose this game than to actually win this game. Because if you just make any unit composition at this point, you just macro well and take a fight at a decent position i think it's going to be close to impossible to actually lose this game like you're you're playing against the Zerg that's just constantly down in income down in workers down in tech only thing he's slightly ahead in is in upgrades um because he's playing fast double evo he's playing double evo and destiny kind of forgot to start his own 1 1 upgrades which i'm not a massive fan of getting two forges against Zerg like attack upgrades are way more important their armor upgrades against Zerg because most of the time they work with very hard hitting units whether that be a Lurker or a Baneling these units have very high damage so the percentage that you take off with every hit if you get armor upgrades is a lot less than it is for example in a in a PvT where Marines they shoot very fast and they have very low damage. So there you take off like 20% of the DPS, and here you might only take of like 3% So not as big of a deal to get armor against Zerg, which is why most of the time, you see Protoss players just get a single forge and attack upgrades. Now, we have no storm, I believe, which at this point, our friend, our destiny, is completely aware of what it is, right? At least he knows it's Roaches, not quite aware of the Hydras, but always try to get storm with this, well, basically in any kind of game. You always want to get storm. Storm is very good against Zerg. You need against Banelings. You need against Hydras. You need against Roaches. You need against Swarm Hosts You always get Storm Storm is the best If you don't get Storm, then don't bother queuing up next game Like, it's extremely powerful to get Instead, what Destiny does, which even this, I can kind of empathize with He's like, you know what? I've been so far ahead for so long I think I can just kind of a-move across the map and go kill him Honestly, I don't even think I mind that too much Like he has a big army He has a decent army as well Like this is Chargelot, Archon There's going to be one or two Immortal It's actually starting Storm as well, starting 2-2 And he has just more stuff. You know, like he's up 30 supply So unless he takes a fight like basically in this joke, or upper ramp or accidentally move commands into his opponent's army I think he should be kind of fine Now there's two rules. Well, there's, okay, there's one rule that I would say. That is very important as a Protoss Whenever you fight, always have a Warp Prism with you in order to reinforce Like we're the only race out of the three that can instantly reinforce in a fight We should use that as well, because we need it So always, whenever you attack, always take a Warp Prism Destiny does not have that. He attacks into a Zerg whose 2/2 just finishes on a ramp while 2/2 is researching for him, while Storm is halfway done, against an army that's only gonna get worse So this is the worst possible time to attack, at the worst angle possible to attack, without any kind of reinforcement because there's no Warp Prism, and yet he's still trading pretty well No Guardian Shield being used either Actually against Hydra armor upgrades are actually kind of nice, so Guardian Shield would have been good to use So this was not only the worst anti-timing This was except perhaps for this location where he could have attacked into a smaller choke Absolutely the worst engagement to take There was no reinforcement. Like this was, I actually think this was the only real way for him to lose except for a move command. Or at least two. The thing is, at this point, I think, destiny is still very far ahead. Now you might be thinking, wait, why is that. He's down 30 supply. He does have storm now and a lot of Templar, but his opponent is on a massive timer. Like the timer is not on destiny. Like, Shadowwater is messing hydras against the Protoss that has a way more sophisticated army with storm, immortals, zealots, everything. There's no hive on the way. Protoss has like an absolute crap ton of Gateways. There's 12 Gateways. Like, the army that the Protoss has, way better in quality than what the Zerg has So if you're just very patient, you don't even need to attack, but even this, like this is a pretty decent start of the fight All you need is one more zealot warping here with your 1600 minerals, your 1200 gas The problem is there is no Warp Prism So once again, he gets pushed back And even now, with all this money, I'd say if you just warp in straight four Templars again, you get your zealots out, you continue Immortal production Look how much money he has Look how much money there is The key could basically be even in supply again. If he just use all that money either into immortals, you can start sending some zealots around as well if you truly want to This gateway should be ready again High Templar being warped in That's very good Gets a couple for storm Now ideally, don't forget, whenever you had a fight, the first thing you want to do is warp in High Templar, rather than first warped in zealots because you want to start getting some energy This is, I'm not sure why he keeps doing this Every single time he's like, he's like waiting for, like basically for a better army than his opponent or he's waiting to max out And he just walks straight across the map for whatever reason. Like I don't mind harassment, but this is not harassing. This is just straight up taking bad fights. He does have some Storms here, and I mean, he probably might be able to kill a bunch of drones. The problem is it's just not necessary. He really just all he needs to do is defend. Like he's so far ahead economically, he's 93 workers as well. Like his army is getting better by every second. He just sacrifices absolutely everything into the Zerg. Again, for the fourth time, it's a proxy gate. Once again, just starting with the 12 Zealots instead of anything else. Two Immortals Relative. It's like all he needs to do is wait until he has to. 200 supply and storm and you just sit there. you can even start 3 3 he could be transitioning into carriers right now I don't care just no there's a small army here we're gonna have a look at this one again just the decision making of where to fight and how to fight this makes no sense whatsoever so here destiny sees three hydras with 12 zealots it's oh there's a fight I might accidentally win Let me just run straight into the 35 hydras that I definitely can't beat. Yeah, here, three zealots over here Kill as many hydras as the nine zealots that were over here in the end. Comes in with the Safe location to morph some Archons Brilliant play. Immortals being rallied in, like, just collect your army somewhere and just wait until you have two storms available Like, he just threw away another 60, 70 supply straight into the Zerg Like, and at this point, yeah, you're probably losing Well, Mazzairo's very powerful Yeah, Masairo is very powerful if you keep warping Archons in his face He even walked into him with the High Templar, A-moving Hydras Realized that wasn't going to work. I was like, you know what? What happens is just morphed him into Archon? six of them destiny destiny destiny destiny yeah interesting opening you should have lost to any all in in the early game we're doing the fingers again you lost to anything in the early game two you should have won all the fights you had every single fight you had I think there are people who would have been able to win that with their eyes closed I think it might have been better in some cases, for you perhaps in the future to just kind of a move across the map because these fights, not the way, my friend, get a Warp Prism with that army, you need it. Three. If you are the one that's getting a better army, that's up in workers, that is better tech, and has the ability to get better upgrades, your opponent couldn't get three-three in that Hive. Don't attack into him with the same composition five, four times. Just giving away unit after unit. Just relax. Send some Zealots to harass and kill four or five workers. That's also cool. Wait until you have 200 supply and just roll him. You had mass Hydra. You had like, you had a 3K bank, 2K bank. Your army was massive. No more a-moving straight into his Hydras. If you see a small army that you can kill, just kill it. Just do it, man. You can do it. but I believe in you And for the question, are Hydras OP? No You just suck It's the way of the world, man Sucker! All right, boys, it's gonna be it I hope you enjoyed this fantastic episode of Is It Imba or do I Suck if you did, feel free to leave a like, comment down below Also, I love everyone to subscribe, try and hit 25,000 by the end of the year Yeah, if we make that, that would be sick All right Love you all See you next time And don't forget, don't walk into Hydras with morphing Archons Bye-bye."

        "text": "What's up boys and girls? Welcome back to a new episode of Is It Imba or Do I Suck? And today we will be looking at Mr Hero Marauder over here, who sent me an email. Let's actually see what this email says. Hi Kev, I'm Hero Marauder, 4K MMR Diamond 1 Terran. Not sure if you do non-Protoss replays. Yes I do. But I really am lost here. In this game I was super aggressive and did genocide on his mineral lines. Yet somehow he survived with 30-L3L3 million. SCVs that I had drones made some lurkers and won the game... cheers thank you very much hero marauder so the issue seems to be lurkers in in TvZ here so let's have a look at it showing off it's all looks solid and standard so far I have to admit I'm I'm not disappointed by any of this just standard one rax expand into uh well whatever it's going to be most likely a Factory we see a second gas coming down but as he said he uh did a genocide on his opponent's mineral line so most of the time this kind of game it just comes down to some kind of army movement that kind of stuff we'll we'll exactly see what happens Reaper into Marine let's see how mr hero marauder controls his first Reaper always curious to see of course That doesn't look half bad. So I'm sure good control on the Reaper. This opponent is not doing too much either. Just trying to get some creep going, I guess, after he deals with his Reaper. CC is getting close to being finished. Factory is on the way. All so far I'm a very happy man. This looks very solid from Hero Moro. Honestly as long as he doesn't lose his first reaper while trying to kill an extra worker or something like that I think it's gonna be completely fine. Switches his Barracks and his Factory which is at least slightly interesting I would say. Goes into Hellion tech lab so could either be Banshee could also still be some kind of some kind of fusion core play, but it's always very, very difficult to say ahead of time, of course. He did get a very fast second gas. His opponent is getting Overlord speed as well as Zergling speed, so he should be pretty okay. Yeah, okay. Third gas, this looks like Battlecruiser. But his opponent most likely will scout it the moment his Overlord speed finishes. So Starport finishes up here, and Hello? Banshee, I guess Well, I didn't expect that No, Fusion Core, right So Fusion Core, and then we'll go into Battlecruiser So this is a very standard opener these days where you just go into Battlecruiser, and from there you can either play Bio from one single Battlecruiser or you can go into multiple Battlecruisers and then Mech Now, so far, honestly, I haven't really seen very many mistakes He's very passive with his Hellions, but that's okay You don't want to die to any kind of Zergling run-bys You know, leaving a couple of Hellions at home never is necessarily a bad decision It's just a decision you can take Now, here come the first four Hellions. Well, he's actually running straight in. Doesn't really know if there's Lings, of course, but just kind of gambles and that's also a gamble you can't take. It goes in I guess this is the, where he goes in and kills all of the workers in the mineral line. I already get ten workers. Three Hellions still alive and we'll just get a bunch more. guess 16 workers go down against four Hellions that's a very good trait as you can see right now our Terran is doubling the worker count um which is obviously quite good on top of that he has a Viking to the nice and scouting or at least to hunt down some Overlords he still has some Hellions for map control and at this point i would like if he just starts saving up his Hellions and doesn't throw them away too much like it's nice to get more Drone kills but at this point you kill so many workers All you really need to do is continuously build SCVs and make sure you have good macro basically. Get your production structures up, make sure you can't get all in So I mean getting a couple more worker kills is always nice, but getting four, I think you got four extra drones, five extra drones and loses three Hellions for it I'm not quite sure if that's worth it Ideally you'd just be getting a bigger Hellion force, deny creep You know, maybe try to kill a couple more Lings That's a third CC as well on top of that, which is good And we'll be going into Mech So we're going to see continued Battlecruiser production most likely. Now from the Zerg, on the other hand, what do we see here? Well, not much, just drones, honestly drones, a couple of queens, spores in the bases Is the Zerg actually aware? Yes, he did scout the Fusion Core, so Zerg does know it's a Battlecruiser The Battlecruiser teleports to the other side of the map, and BCs start chasing these drones That's two, three, four, just shift-picking drones Interesting trade So I think you got four worker kills here and lost a Battlecruiser Now, for people that aren't aware, a Battlecruiser is 400 minerals and 300 gas So ideally you do more damage than four drones It also has a lot of HP and a lot of armor. So it's actually really difficult to lose it to pure Queens. I'm going to go ahead and call that as a mistake. What you want to do is the moment too many Queens arrive is you just fly away and you can fly it back and repair it. And then go again with two Battlecruisers. And then if they're in danger, you can teleport them back. And then you go with three Battlecruisers. You repair them. If they're in danger, you teleport them back. They kind of keep building up your Battlecruiser count like that. That's the whole point of Battlecruiser Mech. It's not a, like, it is a harassment unit but it is a harassment unit that also shouldn't die. So he did a lot of damage to Drones early on, but now he just throws away another six Hellions together with the Battlecruiser And he gets like, sure, he gets a couple of workers every time, but it's actually better to just, like, trading one Hellion for one Drone is not actually a good trade And this wasn't even worse trade I think you got three Drones here, lost five Hellions So units lost is actually relatively even. So of course Terran is still ahead because he killed drones very early on in the game But you don't really He's just so focused on harassing that he kind of forgets to build an army This Battlecruiser does a lot better He just jumps in kills a single drone and then it's like I can't actually fight these queens and he flies away or at least he should fly away I kind of like this move as well, you know the Battlecruiser takes away the attention of the Zerg Then you go in with Hellions and you kill a bunch of workers again So he did get a lot of work here and I actually do appreciate this move a lot. It kills a lot of Lings moving into Hellbat as well Ideally the Cyclone wouldn't be here because it's very expensive and it's not really great at harassing mineral lines You know it's better at poking back and forth at an army Battlecruiser goes back in This is actually good play so this is exactly what you're supposed to do Ideally a second Battlecruiser would be here and he would be focusing the Drones Ah please tell me he's not going to lose this one as well The great thing about the Battlecruiser is that it's so good at getting away. Like it has a lot of base armor, it has a lot of HP, and it can teleport, which are all very good abilities to have when you don't want to lose a unit Now, I almost lost this one as well, but like, you can repair them Just go home, man. You don't need to do this A couple of more Hellions, and let's take a look at what his main army starts consisting of He's going for a Hellion Cyclone, which I also like. I think it's a good play And he could start moving out with his army and actually start trading either against queens or against roaches While doing harassment with small Hellion forces. I got to admit, he killed a lot of workers. And even though not all of them have been successful, the last few have been again. You see, resource loss is still relatively even. But work account is very far ahead here for the Terran. Terran has better economy. Terran has better infrastructure. I mean he's on five factories against a three base Zerg that's still on four gases. Like by all means this game is basically completely over, I would say. If he moves across the map at this point and he locks onto eight Roaches with these eight Cyclones, then he runs away. He might lose one Cyclone and trade against eight Roaches. Then you do that one more time and the game just ends. I think he's being a little bit too passive here with his main army After he did a lot of damage, he could actually just push his lead, try to deny some extra creep His opponent should never be able to get a fourth base And he could definitely, yeah, continue getting more factories, is what I was going to say He's doing a fantastic job, honestly He's doing very well Of course, ideally, you also still have two Battlecruisers alive I'm not sure what happened with the other Battlecruiser, but it died somewhere So ideally you keep this one alive as well Viking here, save the day I actually think Hiramurrata has been playing not a fantastic game, but a pretty decent game so far. mistakes throwing away too many units but I kind of like the way he's been playing it and his opponent is in an awful position I mean there's 51 workers the Hydralisk Baneling against pure Hellion Cyclone like this should never work especially with the complete lack of Creep if if there's some kind of micro here from Hero Marauder yeah this just go back and forth and you should never even lose a single unit I believe if you play like this and you can just keep going back and forth back and forth and in the end I guess you just win so I'm very curious to see how Hero Marauder will be able to lose this game. It's a lot of the time in the Is It Imba or Do I Suck? It's not so much the other player winning as it's our protagonist losing the game in a very special way It does look like Hero Marrother is completely aware that he can repair his units or actually I'm the trouble this guy's doing Hello, Mr SCV This guy's having a blast It's just going here for a spray maybe Just relaxing Oh, there's another one Oh, I guess I'm a misrally of one of the Okay, all of the CCs are rallied over here That's real nice Some extra gases going down And once again, this army, the Hellion Cyclone Army, is an army that should always be trading and on the map. Like this is an army that's so mobile, it's so quick, and it's very difficult to catch So basically always when you're trading with this army, especially against the Roach Army, you're going to be in a good spot You want to be denying creep and trading basically with this And you can be transitioning into something else after, but a lot of the time it's completely fine to just kind of kill your opponent with that Hellion and Cyclone while you still have three, four Battlecruisers alive Now, moving up this ramp, we see some clear indication of things that could go wrong Like, there's a very bad retreat path, so a flank could be very painful. Now, luckily here, our barcode Zerg player decides not to do it, but because there's a retreat that is so small The Banelings do get a lot of splash damage on You don't want to split with Cyclone Hellion either, which is what Hero Marauder did here Instead, you just want to run away while your Cyclones shoot The reason why you usually split with your army is so that you can continue having DPS Like you can continue doing damage basically while being split up so Banelings don't maximize their damage With Cyclones, they keep shooting. while they're running back so it's just better to run away you don't really care about the Hellion shooting unless there's a lot of Lings so yeah this was a really poor trade and you actually see here on a rather falling behind right now in the units lost step as well he still has a way better economy of course he has way better upgrades as well you should continue getting more upgrades the moment he gets some extra money but in general he was still in a completely fine position a little bit of a weird trade here with the Hellion Cyclone in top of the creep tries to get one Queen loses two Cyclones and two three Hellions as well. And he's basically losing against purely a Baneling Roach Ravager army, which shouldn't really be possible with the army that he has And he keeps moving out with way too small armies as well Or well, his initial army was fine, but then after he lost it, he should have just stayed home like, I feel like You have about 20 Hellions going to the other side of the map, while his third base is being ransacked This might actually not be the worst trade, as he does get tanks and eventually most likely will be able to stabilize And might actually be able to get a lot of workers here and a couple of queens will go down But, yikes. Basically, all the units die again to like seven, eight Banelings And every single time this happens, you see, the trades just keep getting worse and worse So even though he killed 59 workers and his income is way better, he's still in a very good position, of course It is starting to get a little scarier I also don't like that this isn't a Planetary Fortress, and this should also be a Planetary Fortress already On top of that it's also completely out of position So, yeah, it's just throwing away so many units right now It's 83 workers, though It's very good worker production, but you just keep throwing away army after army. It's fine to harass, but if you lose 12 Hellions to kill six Banelings and four Drones, that's not very successful harassment And usually sending four Hellions does about as much as eight Hellions. Like, if they don't have enough to deal with four Hellions or they most likely don't have enough to deal with eight Hellions either and both of them they basically one-shot Drone so it's not that big of the deal you know if you only have four that always suggest doing smaller runbys and in different places it's better to have two runbys of four Hellions and one run by of eight Hellion and instead we have hero Marauder moving out with a pretty tiny army once again not max yet not sieged up we'll be moving into well basically Lurker, Roach Ravager with two Tanks each that finally gets the scan in but that's at the end of the fight and only one Tank is remaining. It feels like if he just sits back for like four minutes or not even like why do you say four like a minute and a half he's going to be completely fine but instead he keeps moving out with an army of like 70, 80 supply while his opponent has a bigger army supply but no workers whatsoever He just keeps feeding his army into his opponent On top of that, no Planetaries and not a real good usage of the energy on the command centers either We see almost 600 energy being saved up right now, and that's 12 MULEs That's a lot of income It could also be a lot of SCANs for the Lurkers. I just absolutely love to see a bunch of Tanks, some Cyclones, some Hellions, and just sit back while you harass with Hellions Like this kind of move out is really good Even though this might not work now, like you can just run away You see a big army? You run away And you're like, okay, that's Let me just set up the rest of my defenses And then you max out and you do a run-by and as you're doing a run-by, you push across the map As it makes it easier, you want to always distract your opponent while you're pushing out So you can't get in a good position to fight you. Instead, what we have is we have Hero Marauder with no map knowledge whatsoever His complete army is out of position And the barcode is just moving up a ramp right now, which honestly shouldn't be this dangerous It's like he has, I think Hiramurrather has probably a decent enough army to deal with this but he's completely cut out of position once again And another thing is he needs to split his army too thinly because he has no Planetaries anywhere Like these four tanks could just be one tank if there was a Planetary here. Instead we have, well, four tanks there, a couple of tanks here and I mean the barcode Zerg is trying his absolute best to throw away a bunch of his army into tanks as well. But ideally these tanks would be at home as well. A Sensor Tower or two could also completely help here. And these tanks, you know, you can also move them. Some Terrans believe that once you siege your tank you should never move it again, but I'm of the strong belief that it's nice to unsiege them if your natural base is getting completely destroyed by four or whatever. There we go. That's a nice reaction speed there. I think I've seen slots climbing three faster than this. Lurker being underground and I mean there should be plenty of scans as well and yeah this is what I mean no Planetary here you get filled by Lings and hydras, tank not being sieged up, no Sensor Tower, no vision, one lurker destroying seven different tanks at the same time This lurker has four kills and trust me those are not SCVs or Marines, those are tanks and Cyclones and Cyclones It's just really sad because Hero Marauder was ahead so far all game long And then he just keeps throwing smaller and smaller armies at his opponent, while being up like 40 in worker supply as well. So you actually just want to max out or just do a lot of harass and tech to a better army There's basically two things you're going to just tack to a better army and have been through better tech Or you just keep harassing and you just kind of sit tight while you expand more and more and you just kind of starve your opponent Instead, Hero Marauder kept attacking, attacking, attacking, until he kind of killed himself into his opponent GG well played and he lost the game Aye aye aye Now, of course, the real question here is, boys, the real question here is is it Imba or do I suck? Let's read the email one more time. Somehow he survived with 30 less drones than I had SCVs. He made some lurkers and won the game. Made some lurkers and won the game. All right. Your initial harass was good. I'll give you that. Your builder was good. Your initial harass was good. But losing the Battlecruiser while playing Battlecruiser Mech. Yeah. Not the brightest. Losing the second Battlecruiser while playing Battlecruiser Mech. Now you're really starting to lose the plot. Not continuing Battlecruiser production in general is kind of bad. You always want to keep three, four Battlecruisers around to force your opponent to build some Corruptors. What else was there? Yeah, never building Planetaries. Of course, it's bad. It makes it very difficult. A complete lack of any kind of map vision No Sensor Towers, no Hellion spread across the map Your army was constantly out of position You kept attacking into your opponent with a worse army, most of the time unsieged, without scans, even though you had 12, 13 scans available at all times And honestly, the worst fight you had was at his ramp, at his third base That wasn't even against Lurkers That was against pure Baneling Ravager where you decided to split instead of moving back and then you lost 15 Cyclones So perhaps the Lurker is a little bit too strong, but definitely not in this game No my friend In this game the real reason why you lost is because you suck.

        "text": "What's up and welcome back to a new episode of Is it Imba or Do I Suck? And today we have a very special replay as it's the first replay that got sent to me by a Chinese fan Let me read the email I'm your fan from China and I love your I owe this very much I'm a master about 4,600 in Chinese rank However, when I played with an Imba Z, who is about 3,800, he made me sick with flying dragons Even though I beat him in the end, I didn't think it was the right performance as a Protoss Perhaps I am suck, but Zerg is really Imba After that game, I didn't even want to play PvZ anymore So big words. I can't read Chinese characters, so I don't know this person's name But our first Chinese fan is very serious about Zerg being overpowered, and especially the Flying Dragons So we're on a discovery journey here A, we're figuring out whether Mr Derivative is sucking or if Zerg is Imba And we're also going to find out what unit the flying dragon is I'm going to guess it's the Mutalisk, but it could also be Broodlords, of course Let's head straight into the game As we see a 12 pool starting out of Waterblue, who is the Flying Dragon player, the Zerg, the Imba We have derivative, starting with a standard 1-Rax expand on the other side of the map Quick scout. So, derivative will be able to see it. Let's see what his response will be to everything here. Oh, he scouts, sees the spawning pool, sees the links about the pop. What do we do, derivative? We build a Cybernetics Core, a Zealot, a Pylon and a second gate. Oh. Oh, second pilot already had started. That's very nice. Perhaps a chrono boost on the Zealot. Second Zealot? No, no second Zealot. Just a single Zealot into two gates. Shouldn't have let this finish. It's not useful to let it finish. Like you can just cancel it and rebuild it if you really need to, but most of the time you don't even need to. And now you could just build Adept-Adept-Adept, or you go Nexus into a Adept-Adept. Getting a second gas just to laser natural, which usually is quite bad for Protoss Ideally, you want to be expanding as fast as possible, especially because the Zerg only built four Lings, or maybe six Lings Like, this is a very low Ling count, and you want to get your eco up as quick as possible as well against this I like the double Adept That's good You can do some counter damage with that As long as there's no speedlings out, two Adepts will be able to do a lot of damage usually So that should be good Now we have this Zealot still trying to do something, but that honestly doesn't look too scary here for derivative. Once the two Adepts pop out, yeah, there we go, things will be pushed back. Now this pylon is annoying me and it's probably also annoying derivative. He should have already built some kind of tech, as we see he's flowing a lot of money right now. He also hasn't been continuously building workers, which is always a mistake. You always want to continuously be building workers. As we see the two Adepts making their way across the map to the other side. Shade finishes, get both of those Lings. So early defense hasn't been super good, but I think it has been good enough that derivative is in an okay position, right? He's up five workers. There's no third base yet. Speed isn't on the way yet. Protoss playing double gas, which is a poor response He's banking a lot of money And once his Nexus finishes and this Pylon gets killed eventually for an easy, your time for units to move out, or especially Probes, drift will be in a good location Now this is a mistake You never shade into a natural when you see three Queens and Lings and there's no Drones because your goal is to trade with Drones, not with Lings Don't forget every time you shoot a Ling, that's 25 minerals, every time you shoot a Drone, that's 50 minerals You never want to be fighting Queens If he would have shaded into the main base, he probably also shouldn't have let it finish. Usually if there's more than six lings plus a queen or six and a queen, or there's three queens and two three lings, you never ever go in with your Adepts, it's just going to be a bad trade, unless of course the lings are out of position and you can get like three, four workers. Now, meanwhile, we have an Oracle transition coming out of Stargate. It's also going into a Twilight Council, and he will be going up against a two base Lair off of two gas so far. This Oracle will be able to kill a single worker. Some bad target fire. Just shift click two drones and then fly away. And if that doesn't work, just fly away immediately, honestly. Like no use getting this much damage on your Oracle. It's not worth your time and effort. And also the health of the Oracle, honestly. So Zealot as a follow-up. Now, what has derivative really seen? He is not aware of the gas count. He doesn't know if there's any gases here. What tech is he aware of? All he sees is a spore here. He's not aware of the spire here, so he doesn't quite know exactly what's happening. If you're playing against the two-base Zerg, it's always wise to scout for their, you know, if they have a third base and check their gases. If you see four gas, perhaps it's Muta. Also, it's nice and kind of easy to scout tech if you're playing against a two-base Zerg, and it's very important that you do do that. Derivative, however, isn't really scouting anything. He's going for a Chargelot attack. He most likely will be facing Mutas. You should have taken down this pylon before and taken a third as well already, probably at this point. That's usually a wise decision to play. now we see these three Oracles. These are the guys that need to get the information here for derivative. And as long as they don't have any information, it becomes really difficult to respond, right? You can just blindly start building Phoenixes, which would be the correct response. But you can't just do that. I wouldn't mind him building a single Phoenix just to clear Overlords around the map in general. That's nasty. The way you want to microliss is you poke in and you move away. You poke in, move away every time you pick off a drone. But you don't just want to fly in and start targeting drones like he did and then lose an Oracle. You need to be able to micro away Now, what kind of info did the Terran get here? We see he got the info of two extra gases He isn't aware of there's a third base or not He hasn't scouted any tech yet He knows there is a Lair So right now the only real options are either Roach speed That's why the Lair would be there Swarm Host, Spire for muta, or perhaps Hydralisk Now, he needs some kind of information He needs to know how to respond I also don't like that he's not expanding because you don't actually want to attack into a two-base Zerg You want to defend while taking a third base, while getting your better upgrades. You want to do that with proper information Now, going for a blind air control is probably a bad call Like even if he would be getting all-inned by Roaches or if he would be getting Nydus Swarm Host, you don't want to be on the other side of the map with this arc Same against Mutalisks, you don't want that Now, Mutalisks barely miss this Warp Prism No, they don't miss this Warp Prism Some Chinese voices Now we see this Warp Prism is going to get caught, which is bad, obviously, and this is also one of the reasons why you don't just want to blindly move across the map Now, the good response for this is going to be called. derivative here would be to start building Phoenixes immediately But derivative is a bit slow He still hasn't killed this pylon yet Decided to rebuild five pylons There's not a single Shield Battery here There's nothing to defend the mineral line Shield Battery starts way too late Phoenix starts way too late These stalkers won't be able to get in because he just recall this Oracle instead of recalling all these stalkers, which actually can shoot up And now Waterblood is just in his mineral line And I'm starting to assume the flying dragons, indeed are the Mutalisks, and the Mutalisks are going pretty ham Going to be able to kill a lot of the workers here, but this is not the response you want against two-based Mutalisks. Like you want to defend against two-base Mutalisks, get your own third base, then you just max out or you get a better army and then you kill your opponent But if you start a base trade scenario, it always becomes very difficult to play against Mutalisk, completely forgetting the Mothership Phoenix Happens to the best, of course, just forgetting to control your units Probably way more important things on the other side of that probably was right-clicking this for a couple of times Big plays here out of derivative I mean, this base trade is going quite well, but only because the Zerg is not actually base trading The Zerg is like, oh, crap, let me just go back with everything, I guess. If the Zerg was actually building spines and killing all the workers with his Mutalisk count, derivative would be in so much trouble right now, and he probably would have lost already Like, he's only really alive because the Zerg doesn't really have a clue how to base trade, and also because the Zerg is too afraid to attack eight stalkers with 16 Mutalisks Like these Mutalisks, they have plus one as well They would definitely be able to kill these eight stalkers And then the game just kind of ends Now, even now, the Zerg is still very far ahead, right? He's up 18 workers All he needs to do is build like 10 spines over here. And then just keep killing workers, keep base trading basically, and make sure that he can't die. So here come the Mutalisks again. Now, at this point, there's not that much the Protoss can do as his workers are basically all lost. I wouldn't mind if he continues Phoenix production, though, just a couple to make sure that he can defend these mineral lines. We get like two, three Phoenixes with a battery that's really quite powerful. Now, this army is absolutely awful in base trade, but it's actually kind of good in a direct engagement. So I think the Protoss might be barely able to win a fight like this or barely get cleaned up. It's going to be quite close. Actually, I think Waterloo will be able to clean this up Then all of a sudden there's no anti-air anymore Third base will be built here for derivative So it's actually going to go into a macro game And I guess he will be able to trade out some Zealots for workers, which would be quite nice He's still downing workers, of course Now, during all of this, he actually hasn't produced a single worker He is getting a third base He's oversaturated in the main base He's under-saturated in the natural There's an easy fix for that. He sent a couple of workers from your main to the natural or saturate your gases for all i care you should have continuously been building Phoenixes like he's completely that if this Zerg spends even just 25% of this money there's no way in hell that derivative is going to be able to win this a couple more Stalkers are being warped in still no Phoenixes my friend Phoenixes are a good counter to Mutalisks the only problem is that you need the micro land which is something that derivative hasn't been doing all game as instead of microing it's just been either a moving or I guess move commanding into armies Once again, no proper defense of these Probes just keeps rallying them in. While the natural is still completely under-saturated, why would you rally into a vulnerable base when you have a base with a Photon Cannon and a Shield Battery that still requires eight more workers to mine at full capacity? A lot of the time, these kind of games, they're very difficult to win, but there's still so many things you can be doing way better Finally, we restart Phoenix production, which is important Stalkers trying to get into position, but only one Phoenix at a time It's just kind of painful to watch. Another thing that derivative could be doing is just sending one or two Zealots around to try and kill some workers on the other side or either at the third base when that finishes or at the natural It also pushes the Mutas back and gives you some breathing room Zealot run bys always work like that, like in every situation, even against Mutas Even if your Zealots get caught over here, Imagine losing two Zealots over here That's still better than Mutas continually harassing your mineral line It gives you a lot of time It gives you some space to move around, maybe set up another run by But derivative isn't doing any of that. He just keeps building more and more units and just defending the only area that actually doesn't need any kind of defense And that is this area right now, which is completely useless Still, no saturation in the natural We still see so many good patches here, Derivative What's happening? as the flying dragons keep flying around, you know, doing what the dragons do best Now once again, if the Zerg throws down a Roach Warren at this point or just any tech structure or just spends like part of his money, this game is completely over And Derivative would have a solid loss at his hands We do see him with three Phoenixes However, he's not really tracking the Mutas with this. He's just using the Phoenixes as an extension of his army, which doesn't make much sense The power of the Phoenix is that they slightly outranged the Mutalisks, and in combination with Shield Batteries, they're very easy to keep alive So they're very good defensively, and you can kind of follow Mutalisks with them, right? You don't actually meet them with your army They don't do great against ground units They don't kill Lings very well They're not even great against Queens, but against air units, they're pretty cool So that's why you always want to be chasing Mutalisks with them and micro in them Like, this army doesn't need much micro anyway, this ground army. So we see Waterblue just continuously expanding across the map instead of actually trying to spend a bit of his money Still no real defense here for derivative, who is engaging in the base race of a lifetime in his mind Waterblue is moving out with the majority of his Probes now, and we see a recall into the base I mean, this is actually what you're kind of supposed to do with the Phoenixes is you just go to the Mutas, you poke them, you go back, you poke them, you go back, you poke them, you go back, that's all you keep doing again and again And as long as you keep doing that, like, you're also wasting the time of the Mutalisk. You know, they won't be able to kill stuff while they're busy chasing your Phoenixes That's very important that you don't lose your Phoenixes because the bigger your Phoenix count, the better they get, really If you get like eight, nine Phoenixes out, all of a sudden these Mutas become not completely useless, but they become a lot more useless Like just chasing becomes a lot easier to see and picking up units here And this is what he should have been doing all game already He should have been using three, four Phoenixes and then getting up to five, six Phoenixes and just chasing the Mutas again, again and again Hell, he could have been doing this while expanding We see two Archons stuck. I mean, who really needs Archons anyway, right? It's just a base trade Two Archons is, what, 8 supply out of 63 supply That's only like 10, 12% of his army right now It's way better to be defending this little ridge than have them in your army against Banelings and Hydralisks Hell, you probably would have actually completely destroyed this fight, but I'm sure the rivetive is very glad that these Archons were gazing into the future Oh, what do you see? Forgovoire Great Quality play here. derivative somehow manages to keep four Stalkers alive because water blue forgets that four Stalkers don't actually beat seven Mutalisks and six Lings. He also water blue has some of the weirdest expanding habits like this base actually never got attacked he just ran away from it was like this this is too dangerous at this point you know this I might accidentally lose that as we still have the the two Archons still quite haven't figured out how to get through past this hole be attacking this Gateway finally gets it down only took in three minutes so very quick reactions here by derivative and here come the flying dragons again we'll be taking out a Pylon rather quickly and the Drones after having expanded on the other side of map decide to go back to this basis is this is this is peak Starcraft here boys I mean we have a Zerg who consistently have been floating loading 2. 5k minerals, actually getting close to running out of money because he's long-distance mining gas across the map I've never seen this before Like the Terran should not be in this game anymore, but somehow he still is So you see more Battlecruisers coming Now 11 Battlecruisers against four Archons and four Stalkers Now, this Stalker force should never ever be able to move out This is good, by the way This run by is good I would love if it's just one or two Zealots and he scouts around a bit with them But in general, like, this is not a bad play, I think It's actually a pretty good play. And if you can pull the mutas away and then take out another base at the same time, that would be pretty big I think at this point, also, we're going to need to see more Phoenixes being built because you need something to track this army with Like, you need to know where this flying army is at all times. And that's very easy to do with Phoenixes, and sometimes you can even do some damage. At this point, I also wouldn't mind a split of army, right? You leave two Archons at home Archons trade extremely well against Mutalisk and against Lings, which is everything that WaterBlue has here So if you just leave two Archons, one Zealot at home, at these batteries, that's basically safe. And then the rest of your army can just roam around the map and kill every single base it meets As long as there's no Roaches out, this should absolutely be a winning strategy Instead, we see derivative It's just moving out with everything It just gives up his base instead of leaving two Archons behind I mean, he's not going to get much of a fight from anything that Waterblue has, right? Like Mutalisks are so bad at fighting Now he warps in two Stalkers, moves them straight away, away from the Shield Battery, of course Wouldn't want them to be safe As Water Blue takes out every single Cannon and this is where the full base trade, I guess, kind of starts. And our boy Waterblue has been preparing for this for the past seven minutes This base hadn't even been attacked yet, but it already was evacuated These Drones were long gone The only thing that Waterloo hasn't thought of yet is building production instructions at other bases, so it's most likely just not going to be able to produce anything Now, once again, of course, this army could have been split in half, and this game would be completely over, but now this game is getting a lot more exciting So it's always good to see the players think about the audience as well, you know You always want to create good games for your fans, and our boy derivative, definitely. Definitely is creating a good game for defense here He could have won about a million times already just by building Phoenixes or splitting his army semi-competently Scouting for any hidden bases, you know? Just anything really would have done the trick So we see a full recall now Actually accidentally leaves two Archons behind And it's fine to leave two Archons at home where there's Shield Batteries and Photon Cannons But if you just leave two Archons randomly on the map, and there's 19 Mutas and 16 Lings, you're just going to lose these two Archons if the Zerg is paying attention And just like that, you threw away, well, about 600 gas for free, for absolutely no reason. If the Zerg was paying attention, luckily for derivative, the Zerg decided to not pay attention, continues building Mutalisks and a Spawning Pool. Oh, these two Archons. At least one of the Archons, I think. Yeah, one of them will fall. Second Archon is making the way to the top right side. Now, at this point, I actually don't think there's very much that derivative can do, except build units. I mean, he does have 1,200 minerals, and it's not like there's that much going on in this game that he doesn't have the time to spend his money, right? Like, mate, you're. It's very difficult for me to believe that this amount of money takes about two minutes to come in, right? So this just means that he hasn't been producing anything for the past two minutes, which is just rather impressive for me. It's just been looking at his army. Now, High Templar get warped in. The moment the mutas fly into the main base, and if Waterblue was paying attention, these two could have died now. We're just going to see. No, not a single one. Not going to die either. All right, no micro. That's fine. Waterblue once again with a second spawning pool now is on the other side of the map. and derivative finally realized I wait a second I think if I split my army somewhat well maybe he can't fight or maybe if I spent some of my 1600 minerals maybe I can split my army and just be completely fine he rebuilt the spire Waterblum is just fantastic to watch him isn't it because Mutas are really what he needs right now not anything to counter the Archons Just more Mutas. Actually, he's flowing 1600 gas as well and 2K minerals. Its derivative just keeps trying to expand on 15 workers, trying to play the late game Half the worker supply of his opponent Absolutely no clue how many bases there is on the map Like no real vision. Instead of just splitting his army and going for, you know, hoping for the best I think that's really the best call at this point be some more Zealots being warped in, finally some of that money being spent Now he is aware there's a base here, he's all creep here, but for some reason derivative isn't too fond of denying bases You know there's a Lair here, it's like this is where I want to go Run-bys might be a little bit too difficult to execute, so this base will remain mining till the end of time, I guess. Double gas is being taken at this base as well as here Yeah and the flying dragons come back into the mainways If this is what all games look like on the Chinese server, I want more of those replaced boys. Like, this is exciting stuff. This is a world I've been denied so far. And, you know, sometimes you figure something out in life. And you're really sad that you didn't figure it out early the year in life. I'm having one of those moments right now. I wish I was aware of how much superior the Chinese server was to the European server. Imba or do I suck? Holy crap. These guys are really making a game out of it. More long distance mining. Instead of just mining from this base, we have Water Blue long distance mining from two bases at the same time. It's high level stuff right here. More Mutalisks. There's 23 right now and he's running into the supply block of a lifetime as well. I don't think Water Blue actually has injected anything in the past 20 minutes or so. It's completely supply blocked. They actually is getting very close to taking out all the Nexus right now as there's more Lings on the map. There's still some Drones roaming around. I love that he's just, you know, the one thing I really need right now is what Water Blue thinks is more Extractors. We have Drones just continuously moving around the map. going to be able to finally find the base with the spire This is actually turning into quite an exciting base rate right now Like nexus in random locations, random extractors, more random extractors, another nexus Because derivative, don't forget, have been saving up for his retirement, or perhaps for the next game Now, all of these buildings are going down, half of the Mutas are not fighting There's 23 Mutas, there's six Archons and 10 Stalkers I think it's still possible to do a 50-50 split of this army defend your structures and roam around with another part of your army Oh! Oh! Oh! Jesus Okay, he only lost five Mutas there That could have been a lot worse. Oh, is our friend Waterblue aware of everything? I'm not quite sure I just love that derivatives plan is like, you know what I'm going to do? I'm just going to defend this base this is some I don't know what this means he's probably complaining about flying dragons 2,000 flying dragons is what he's saying I took Chinese in elementary school Zerg is broken Chinese dragons no wait flying dragons are broken I'm supposed to win this game I love it skewing up Probes instead of building Pylons he has a single worker This guy is gonna have the job of a lifetime really As finally we actually have an army split. It took him 15 minutes of base trading to realize that splitting his army might be good I'm so happy right now I actually couldn't be happier This is what, except he should really defend this base You have a single probe If you can't build pylons with this anymore, you just lose the game No, don't let it die Hello, derivative derivative, come do-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do Oh, look at this Micro! Nexus dies New Nexus on the way Single probe still remaining This army just idling, because, I mean, are we really in a hurry? No, we still have one pylon left and a Nexus at 10 HP Not too much of a hurry What's still on the map here, boys? There's no drones left, that's for sure. There's a single base. He could actually just build two overlords and continue building drones, but Waterblue hasn't been making the hottest decisions this game either. so I can't really complain too much. And all derivative needs to do right now is just find the basis and not lose this. And he's going to be completely fine. Trust me. He's going to be in a wonderful position. But it is, of course, kind of scary. Oh, does find one of the extractors. Knows there's an extractor here, went into the base with the zealots as well, then decided it's not worth it. Then decided it is worth it after all. Three overlords being produced. So Waterblue realizing, he's like, all right. he knows what to do. He knows what to do So we have Waterblue scouting around for the Nexus, not quite finding it And this is a good play by Derivative So it really only took him 15, 16 minutes to realize that splitting his army probably would win in the game Oh, Mr Derivative Oh, get spotted by the Mutas This base still not found two Drones instead of mining moving it across the map Come on, just mine a little, my friend Just a little bit I just, yeah Another Hatchery Please build an Extractor with this This would make my day See some nice Muta-micro But I mean, there's too much stuff right now, right? I don't think there's a lot the Zerg can do. Why would he recall? You're seeing it, mate. You're seeing it. It's here. Yes, Yes. It's here. Get it. There's another base here. This is never going to end. I'm going to be stuck in this replay for the rest of my life. With you guys. This has to be some kind of meme. Oh, this base falls. And now we have the remaining forces of derivative chasing the Mutalisk. Zealots first, of course, because the Zealots ever catch up with the Mutalisks, they might be able to dance underneath them or punch the sky. I think this is it, boys, no? This has to be it. Derivative actually is playing this out well, you know? He's except... I'm not quite sure where's probes. Here's the Probe. Might want to send it back to mining or something do something useful with it But yeah, this is the play You know you send around Zealot you send around a second army and then you're gonna be completely fine But it took him a while didn't it Seven mutas remaining against six Archons No GG Wow Wow, Mr Derivative, Mr Derivative Yeah, first of all, let me state that I'm extremely happy I've been getting a few more Chinese replays, and this was the first of, I can only do many Chinese replays that were going to be watching, and is it Imba or do I suck as this was an absolute blast So thank you very much for that derivative But holy cow, the Pylon wall. at the start. The complete lack of scouting, the losing the prism to 10 Mutalisks, without even dropping the Archons in time initially, the, what else did we have? The two Archons that stayed at home looking into the fog of war instead of joining your army to win the game. Building the lack of Phoenixes whatsoever, the unsaturated natural I don't think I'm going to have enough hands for this What else was there? Unsaturated natural Just the rallying of Probes into the unsecured third, the complete want of, the complete, well, whatever it was, lack of splitting army for the first 25 minutes of this game. Like eight things, my friend. Mutalisk can be hard to deal with, I agree. But Mutalisk aren't the issue, or the flying dragon, was not the issue, my friend. You were the issue. And the issue with you is that you, you're suck. That's just the way it is, my friend. That's just the way it is. All right, boys. If you enjoyed this video, feel free to subscribe, Tomb Zoop, slap the like button and put a comment down below. If you also think that Mutalisk are too powerful, all right? Love you all. And I think we had a bit of a first, you know, first Chinese replay and the first time someone sucked and actually won at the same time so absolutely fantastic. See boys next time for a new video bye bye."

        "text": "Waza boys and girls welcome back to a new episode of Is it Imba or do I suck as I got sent a replay by another Chinese viewer these two people are friends both in Team Gaga let me actually read the email because this is a very special one again Chinese people keep sending me special emails hello I'm your Chinese fan this game between me and my friend but after I win this game my friend said I win just because Terran Imba The Terran are so unstoppable and operate is easy Zerg just the opposite I win this game, but lost debate So I want to ask you to help me to see if he is suck or Terran is Imba. Please, your fan, King Doom. So I said I wasn't going to do this. I wasn't going to judge other people's replays, like if they didn't sit with them themselves. But I think this story is so good that I can. So we're going to be helping our friend Gaga-Mexam. master proving either oh no wait we're gonna help you have gaga master either prove that Terran is Imba so mech is Imba or that gaga master sucks so we're gonna be mainly watching from his perspective let's get straight into it boys I've been getting a lot of a lot of Chinese replays by the way and I keep every message starts the same is your videos are very popular in China and it makes me glad to hear I would also like the that's uploading my videos if you could shoot me a quick email that would be helpful because I have a couple of questions you know my email address obviously that's head into it now though into the replay as we have just a standard gas first opener in against the Hatchery first so a very standard opener to Overlords being built 18 workers and with these two workers this one will be ready to the Extractor should be rally to the Extractor and then this one can build a Spawning Pool. That's how it usually works. He does it the other way around I mean, it's not that big of a deal, right? Who really cares? Let's speed this up a bit. The start never is the most interesting part I'm not quite aware what the level is of these two players, by the way. They didn't tell me what the level is But they both have the same portrait, so they should be around a similar level We see some good scouting coming out of Gaga Master here It's got it all around the map with his Overlord And I was like, you know what? I'm going to figure out if there's a Command Center on the other side. First Reaper makes its way across the map as well What will this Reaper be able to see? Well, not much Won't be able to block this hatchery either So good start for Gagamaster gets his third hatchery up without any real trouble A couple of Lings will be able to deal with this Reaper And then once the queen pops, this Reaper, I mean, is practically useless, right? Meanwhile, what did he scouted? He scouted the factory, scouted the barracks, so he knows it's most likely, going to be Hellions. I mean in theory it could still be like some Marine Tank stuff, but you can poke in a little bit later again and make sure that they swapped 90% of the, well 99% of the time it's going to be Hellions first Then we see King Doom floated his Barracks away immediately Not even gonna use it to build a Tech Lab for the Starport or something like that It will be straight just using it as a spotter I guess somewhere on the map Now, this is something that as Zerg player, if you are aware of this, if you scout this, it would be really sick to know this, because this immediately 100% tells you, hey, this is Mech. And you can start preparing for that, right? Instead, now he gets overlord speed, which wouldn't have been necessary if he just would have spotted this swap Because Starport also is a lot less likely, because for a Starport, usually you need a Tech Lab and it's great if you, you know, the Barracks needs to build a Tech Lab for the Starport most of the time So, a little bit of a scouting error, but not the biggest of deuce. You know, He's still getting overlord speed He's getting his Ling speed He's going to be in a good spot This isn't what's going to lose him in the game I mean, eventually he will see this Barracks start floating. Okay, actually he's going in now as his overlord speed is about to finish. Let's follow his vision, see what he's seeing And he sees no barracks. of course it kind of floated here but now he sees the barracks on the map so right now this is the timing where uh gaga master should be like okay this is a hundred percent mech i should start preparing for that right so get your roach warren get your evo chamber continue getting drones continue getting queens basically and then you scout with this overlord which you have overlord speed with whether it's uh triple cc or how many factories there is you know because it could be um fast cyclone Hellion could be Blue Flame Hellion a quick build for that as well I'll remove this thing. It's annoying me But instead, we don't see a big cell. We see that the Gaga Master managed to figure out that there's a second Factory, but he isn't aware if there's a third base or not. Now, he's lacking some Drone production. I'm not sure why. It has a lot of Larvae, plenty of money as well. I mean, really should start building a bunch more Drones. He has plenty of supply as well. Oh, maybe he's a bit of bit like E-Laser, who just keeps building Overlords, even though he doesn't really need them. Yeah, right now he has a lot of Larvae already that should just be turning into Drones as soon as possible. It's that he's building some Roaches. I don't mind a couple of Roaches. In this case, of course, there is Hellion Cyclone on the way, but it's very, very important that you also drone up sufficiently And it's not normal that Zerg has this lower drone count, if nothing really happened in the early game I mean, he should be at 60 workers at this point already We see a lot of money being floated for both players, but they're only paying attention to the Zerg, because he claimed that Terran was imba And here comes the annoying part, right? You have these Cyclones, these Hellions, and the Cyclones lock onto the Roaches, and the Hellions deal perfectly with the lings Now, the Roach count is way too little. There's loads of money in the bank, 13 larvae as well, so he could easily build a lot more units. Instead, he's just completely busy microing these roaches, which it's good to micro units. Don't get me wrong, but most of the time it's a lot more important to actually be producing at the same time as well. Like, micro only gives you marginal gains, having good macro gives you way bigger gains. We see 2 5K floatage at 6 30. That's really early to start floating stuff. Funny thing is, this injects have been pretty good. And a Zerg is really easy to macro because you don't even need to look at what you're building. You can just press your Hatchery Hotkey, press the Larva button, and then just hold down the Drone key or hold down the Roach key So this should definitely be possible I mean, if he wasn't injecting, I'd understand it But he is injecting He just wasn't spending his Larva at all Now, Fourth Base is very late We see still floating a lot of money Evolution Chambers are also rather late Once again, lots of money being floated But now, there's a couple of ways you can deal with Hellion Cyclone You can either try to get, you know, try to kind of keep him at home with run-by that kind of stuff And then once he transitions into Siege Tanks, perhaps, you can get Swarm Host. Or what you can do is you can get like two, three Infestors as well to make life a little bit easier. Or you can play Hydra Bane against this and then go into Vipers later on. I've seen that a lot as well. But staying on pure Roach while floating 1,900 minerals is not something that I necessarily recommend. Once again, I've mentioned this many times before and is it Imba or do I suck, but you can't take this money when you lose the game. It doesn't save up into the next game. I know in a lot of games, you know, you... It's not like an RPG where it matters what your gear looks like in this current game. Definitely not important here. Just need to spend all your money as good quickly as possible and then you get to start the next game again. Gaga Master doesn't seem to be aware of that as he's finally getting to producing some new Overlords, three initially and then nine more so he's going to have plenty of supply for the next 25 minutes. That's glad to see. That He completely stopped his creep spread as well. He still has seven Queens but they're just kind of idling over here making sure to protect this very important ramp. Now they're going on a little mission probably was this oh just injecting okay fourth base finally is up but hasn't been injected yet either drone count is still insanely low finally there's an Infestation Pit as well which it's about time and he will use it to go straight to Hive now he has plenty of money to build just a couple of Infestors two three Infestors would help so much in this army fighting those Cyclones is so difficult if you can never catch them so Infestors really help with that you don't even need to get Pathogen Glands instead we see a Lurker Den And Hydra starting As his Queens are being destroyed, without any real reaction from the Master here. This is just a bit painful to watch, honestly. He's floating still 12k minerals. I don't think he's been below 1k since the 6 minute mark. We see King Doom starts rallying Thors across the map. There's not the brightest of place. And Master actually we should be able to clean this up, I believe. I mean, Thors can't really kite away. It's mass Roach. So tanks usually are a better call for the Terran. But let's continue in our game. Still only on 60 workers, 10 minutes in the game. Ideally, Zerg would be around 80, 82 workers at like the 7 minute mark. So he's about three minutes late with, well, more like five minutes late with his worker count, actually. Four minutes. And here we see a bunch of Overseers transforming because Maybe he's afraid of not being able to see Widow Mines or not being able to see Banshees So actually check what he, when's the last time he scouted? So he has scouted a little bit He isn't quite aware of the Armories He does see there's a fourth base on the way Now he's getting Lurkers with the seismic spines, which Look, it's not bad to get Lurkers necessarily, but you're going to need Vipers as well Vipers are the real key in this army Whenever you're building a Roach Hydra-based or a Hydra-based army against Mech, like you can't just run into your opponent with Hydras Hydras are glass cannons They're bad at fighting. Lurkers aren't quite glass cannons, but it's nice if they can be in position, and then something gets pulled into it So Vipers, there we go, are always the answer And our friend Master has been having a rough time getting to Vipers He finally is there He's getting to a healthy drone count as well, up to 72 Still has a lot of money floating And he still needs a couple of extra workers His creep threat definitely needs to be improved as well His map vision is practically non-existent He actually has absolutely no map vision whatsoever except for the creep So it's very difficult for him to see harassment coming, knowing where his opponent is going to move his army, etc., etc. I don't mind the adaptive tailands I wouldn't mind seeing something like a Spire, either for Broodlords, well, actually just for Broodlords against this army might be useful to get, especially in combination with Vipers, Broodlords, even though they've been nerfed can still be very useful Did King Doom, is this the same Barracks at first? Or did he rebuild the Barracks? So he could build more Factories Sometimes they lose their first Barracks and they're like, oh crap, we need to rebuild that So that's something that could have happened There's a cool logo on the Barracks It sounds like a dragon It's pretty neat. So what do we have? How many Vipers is there? Now, also notice that how absolutely nothing is happening this game Master is not really scouting, not putting on any pressure, not really trying to poke holes in his opponent's defense Even though it's pretty nice, especially if you have Vipers, to just be a little bit aggressive, and then when you're being chased away to pull a couple of units or if tanks are sieged up, to pull some tanks into your Hydra Lurker Army, I guess in this case. Like you do need to do something as the Zerg because if you just let the Terran macro up, the longer the game takes, the better it becomes for the Terran simply because he's going to be able to get so many Orbital Commands and after a while, start sacrificing his SCVs So right now we see 72 SCVs for the Terran and he might go up to like 75 or 80 even But in the end, if he gets like seven, eight Orbital Commands, he might be able to just throw away 40 SCVs, which means his army will become absolutely massive And it's also Terran that has usually the better maxed army, especially if there's still roaches in place. So you want to be trading out in an effective way Right-clicking a Planetary is not really an effective way Like it's not the way you should be doing it You can just repair the Planetary and you lost 20 Roaches for nothing Like try to, even though you need, like you do need to get rid of the Roaches I agree with that But like the way that Master is getting rid of the Roaches, he might have all just killed them himself, you know, just A-click on top of the Roaches But because they're not, they're not really doing any damage Like, this is already better where you're sending in a run by into one location. He might actually get a Thor for his effort here. And here he, you know, he gets a cancel. And he does lose the roaches in the end, which is fine, but it's still better than right-clicking a Planetary. And of course, he wants to lose the roaches to get a more worthwhile army. In his opinion, that's Hydras. He might be right. We'll see. If he uses them correctly, this army could definitely. The problem is the complete lack of creep spread. Don't forget we actually haven't seen anything happen on the map in the past four minutes since a nine minute mark. And I think Master might have been, might have gone from here to here, so he managed to add two creep tumors. That's not ideal. Oh, we have more action. Master found this Barracks. It's like, alright, I'm getting you again. I believe this is some big F2 syndrome as well. F2 syndrome as well. We do have a couple of good pulls. Yeah, he's absolutely F2. Because you can see his groups. He has a separate group for the Vipers and a separate group for eight Lurkers. But every time his army moves, his whole army moves. Now, that's not the way you want to be fighting with a Viper army. You want to be controlling the Vipers individually. This is a good fight, by the way, good blinding clouds, some good pulls as well. And Lurkers going absolutely ham. Like, this was an absolutely masterful fight. This is exactly how you want to be doing it Now you just go back as the Zerg with your vipers while you move in to capitalize on your lead You just killed an entire Terran army and still have your lurkers Go attack this base Go attack this base But do it quickly While you're getting back to get energy, you can already start moving with this army Don't let your opponent set up once again As usually, that is not the way you want to go about it You want to capitalize on your lead as fast as possible Even if it's just taking down a base, I'm not saying, hey, run up the ramp, kill your opponent, because that usually doesn't work. But just taking out this base definitely would have been possible. And then afterwards, after your Vipers have gotten their energy back, you can join with the Vipers with your main army. You're going to be completely fine. What? I feel like master has a very interesting way of seeing things. Like so far, there hasn't even been a Starport done yet. This is the first Starport finishing. And he already had three Overseers in case of Banshee, Cloak Banshee, now he has five Spore Crawlers in the middle of the map. I feel like his priorities are kind of incorrect. Still, look at this. I think, is this the same as two minutes ago? Or did he add one more? I can't remember. It moves so quick that it's hard to remember where it was before. you know it's unbelievable the speed at which master manages to spread his creep i'm a big fan of watching Formula One cars but this is a different level i think i know what to do these days if there's no Formula One holy crap this is going fast have a couple of lurkers now now master's thinking all right i killed half his army earlier i probably should be able to kill this and i agree if he did this about two minutes ago after he actually won the fight but now it's just a little bit too late he loses all of his vipers for basically free managed to get one Thor also lost like 15 or 20 hydras against tank fire tanks moving forward he's not even attack he's just moving in tank fire like he wants to lose his hydra force so the way you want to engage is you throw your blinding clouds or you do your and then you make sure your hydras stay out of tank fire. Now, if that's not possible because there's too many Siege Tanks, then you try to go into a different angle You rotate, as we call it, so you could take down these rocks and then quickly move to this area and hope that you're faster than the Terran, which is very possible because Siege Tanks are really, really slow The thing that bothers me about Masters is that, first of all, he doesn't use Blinding Cloud properly, and his Hydralisk micro is awful Like, if there is 35 Siege Tanks or well, in this case, if there's 15 Siege Tanks and you can only get nine Siege Tanks, which are Blinding Clouds, that means that six Siege Tanks will still be shooting onto your Hydralisks That's a fight you can't take. Hydras have no HP whatsoever. Like, 90 HP on a hydra, like Siege Tanks practically one shot them. So if there's six Siege Tanks, you've got to be really careful with your hydra movement. You can't just walk into the opponent and be like, well, but I disabled half his army. Yeah, I mean, it's a good job, but there's still the other half that has like seven more range than you and that has splash damage and is basically the hard counter to your unit. Like, you can't just walk into that. Like, that's not how this game works, you know. Like you need to find a better spot. This army is really slow. Just attack a different area. But the problem is that Gagamaster has no, once again, no map vision. He doesn't quite understand what's rotating or army movement is. He is getting his vipers back, which is good to see. You see five vipers. And now he's like, oh, this is the scouting hatchery, you know? Gaga Master has figured out a new way to know when he's being attacked. Instead of sending like a Zergling on the map or just spreading creep slightly faster, he just builds hatcheries on random bases. And if they get attacked, he knows, ah, that's where the army is. It's an interesting way to go about it. So is this fight. You see the lurkers completely in the back, not really participating in the fight so far. No blinding clouds being used as of yet, as there's once again eight Siege Tanks, just shelling away on those hydras Not the greatest fight for King Doom, as there was some abducts early on Now again, here, just abduct Pull it into your units Every single time he uses an abduct, because he's using F2 for his army movement, he also sends in 10 hydras So he gets a Thor, loses not nine hydras and then he's like oh I thought I used abduct properly but. Well he did use abduct properly the problem is just that he wasn't using his hydras properly now he still is in an okay spot right like he has a lot of money he has a pretty decent army as long as he just takes a decent like a fight like he did earlier in the middle he actually could be in an okay position the problem is I'm kind of starting to lose hope that master can actually take fights like he did earlier I'm not sure who was playing for him at that point, but it seems like that person is gone. Here he is Look at that. Patient, very patient play, uses the parasitic bomb on the Liberators, just using the Vipers, pulls one in, goes again. Even though this is slow, this is the way you're supposed to play. And if you do it with like eight Vipers at the same time, it's completely fine. Instead of keeping up the patient play, we see him just rushing in again with Hydras. Lurkers completely out of range. Full blinding clouds. Move forward your Lurkers. Move forward the Lurkers. They're not attacking anything. All right. Just let them sit there. I feel like Master might be slightly... What's this? The Overseer Army? Hello boys. What are we seeing today? What is this? Madness. Tanking some fire from the Thor shots. What I was going to say is that I feel like Master overestimates the range of the Lurkers a little bit. This really makes no sense. The way that he's been using them is like a defensive tool, how he used them against Protoss. The problem is that Terran has tanks. Tanks kind of outrange Lurkers. It would be like if Immortals at first. 14 range then you would be using Lurkers slightly different as well or perhaps you shouldn't be using Lurkers at all in that case against tanks of course still playable now is there new Vipers yes here we go five six new Vipers good Viper count we still have a good bank once again all it really takes is one good fight patience and one good fight so what i'd love to see is if master actually just stops using his Hydras because everything every time he starts moving his Hydras stuff goes wrong If you just hold positions as Hydras just in the back and then uses his Vipers That's the, there's a sweet spot, you know, just abduct these guys into your Lurker Hydra stuff. Hell, at this point, if you don't think you can fight the army, you can even base trade, you know? Leave a couple of Lurkers behind to slow down the pushing and base trade What is not the way to fight is, is to keep walking into mech again and again and again and again while flying 20 over Overseers into Thor vision range Forgets to GG as well Oye, yo, yoy, yoy, yu, yu, y Gaga master You have been floating over 1K Let's do it properly We'll make myself big Wow, what a nice turtleneck sweater I know You've been floating over 1K for the entirety of the game, Gagamaster, the entirety of the game Your unit composition is playable It's playable. The problem is the way that you play it is not playable. This is a unit composition that is playable if you micro your units, which this game you haven't really been doing at all. At certain points, it looked like you were going to for a bit, but then you lost patience immediately. Let me think, what else was there? You complete lack of map vision. The Formula 1 level Creep spread. No good. Needs to be a little faster there, my friend. Maybe a counterattack every now and then. the way you threw away the initial roaches into the Planetary Fortress general viper usage i think that's it i uh you know i just i i don't know what to tell you i i don't think oh i'm getting called what is this yeah hello hmm all right master master yeah yeah all right i'll tell him just got the call master you suck and it isn't Terran that's Imba no no no alright thank you very much for watching if you did enjoy this replay is it Imba or do I suck feel free to subscribe to my YouTube leave a comment down below and do the thumbs up as that helps me a lot thanks for all the Chinese viewers as well for sending me all the replays it's been an absolute pleasure reading all your emails some guy even sent me the translation of all the unit names in Chinese to English which I had a good laugh reading as well. I put it on the screen now So thanks for that and I'll see you boys tomorrow with a new episode of YouTube Play StarCraft So see you boys then Bye bye."

Terran went Cyclone Tank against me. I had really good map vision, but I still could not stop his Formula 1 Cyclones from sniping my Nexus. When I try to save the Nexus from his Cyclones, his Tanks blasted me because Cyclones have Imba range. So they can attack my Nexus from far away and I have to go into my Nexus from my Nexus and I have to go into Tank range to fight them. Terran mech is totally broken. Thanks harsh them SIO vs The Terran is 4.8k MMR and I'm about 4.6K MMR on the Korean server So there's a Korean replay I guess 4.6 would be about Masters 3 Masters 2 level Not quite sure how that stuff works, but I haven't loved Grandmaster in the past eight years, boys Everything below that all looks the same to me Terran mech is obviously a topic that is heavily debated Sometimes we see it pop up Other times the Terrans say it's too weak to play against Protoss A lot of people struggle with it Let's have a look at how SIO does Now we're going to be paying attention to a couple of things. He mentions his map vision, which is one of the main things we're going to be paying attention to And second, we're going to be paying attention to his army composition and army usage Now, army composition against Mech can be a little bit tricky Because against Hellion Cyclone, you want to be playing either Colossus or Stalker or Disruptor base But then once tanks enter the fray, you want to be heading more into the direction of Immortal, Charge, Archon So you can really collapse and jump on top of that Terran army So it can be tricky, but these are the main things we're going to be looking for. Another thing we're going to be looking for is you guys at home to subscribe to my new YouTube channel link will be in the description and in the comments where I'll be only casting games. Please subscribe to that It would help me a lot Thumbs up as well on this video Let's get straight into it. I'm getting better at this All right, we have the standard Command Center opening here by Schlaflosh It sounds like a very German name. Not sure what it would mean, but very, very German indeed And a good wall here by Sayo It's like a semi wall, you know. It doesn't quite wall off any area, but will wall off the Reaper. Second pylon on the low ground is all looking very, very steady Our opponent's Terran will be playing a barracks into Reaper Probe is, I'm sure what this probe is doing, probably just hiding away from any potential reapers And you might go into Robo here, yeah Straight into robotics facility So most likely this will be followed up by a stalker as well Now you're always got to be careful with rallying your probe down Oh, Saio's doing a good job This is good to watch This really is good to watch He has a very solid start He's doing good movement with his adept, lacking a little bit of probe time on his natural nexus, but in general he's actually doing quite a good job here. I'm proud of him for it. Our 4 6K player on the Korean server Shades down to the natural as his Stalker pops This is perfect, completely denying the Scout of the Reaper so far This is actually exactly how you're supposed to play This early game could have been one of my replays. Building positioning is perfect Not quite sure on the second or the third Chrono Boost on this Gateway, as it's not really necessary You're already denying the Terran. Now with this build order, I know this build order because this is my build order, you get a second Gateway and then you get a third base pre-probe gets the night This has been really good This has been very, very good by Sayo. If he keeps playing like this for the rest of the game, oh boys, we might have a Terran Imba, a Mech is Imba, but it's also possible, of course, that he will start messing things up I'm not a massive fan of where this Pylon is positioned This Pylon pretty much does the same as this Pylon Could have been a spotter Pylon over here, could have been an early Pylon, earlier Pylon here or even a Pylon here to give some extra vision So not the biggest offense of that Pylon It is such a minor thing that, you know, I shouldn't really be complaining about that Now, Observer arrives on the other side of the map. Pompidon, what's he going to see and how's he going to respond? So he sees a Widow Mine, sees a drop moving out, he sees a Factory floating away from the Reactor So either this is going to be a a Hellion drop or it's going to be a Mine drop and if he sees the Cyclone based on timings he could figure out it's only going to be two because the factory won't have time to produce four in the time that it had now he has Stalkers in production what he where was the scan i heard a scan okay probably to get an observer nice not sure if he got it or not now we see good vision here by sayo gets his Stalkers in position because of this and slothlos won't be able to really do anything and i mean is sayo really is playing a good game has good Probe count as has as has all the timings are correct like honestly this is it's almost like watching myself play it's very it's really quite creepy charge armor i would have preferred seeing a Colossus build first but if he figures out at the Mech you don't actually want Colossi like if I'd see this I'd keep my row away I wouldn't cancel it because it's nice in case you need disruptors and then what you can do is you can get something like prism speed and with prism speed the nice thing with that is that you can you know you can easily pop into the opponent's main base with with Zealots and stuff like that but Colossus would not be the the answer here now the problem that SIO has is that he hasn't actually scouted that it's Mech yet so that's really the first mistake you want to confirm hey is this bio or or not. There's two ways to do that Either you send one of these observers I understand he lost an observer, so it may be difficult Then what you can do is you can warp in a Sentry and you always want to scout with a hallucination Like, hey, what is my opponent doing? Because right now he's building towards an army composition that is simply incorrect Another thing I'm not a massive fan of is the Stalker positioning here Should of course be on the edge, in combination with either the cannon here or even having a cannon here, as this Medivac is threatening two bases Now we have one, two tanks, a couple of tanks Once again, Sayo is still relatively blind. Actually does get good map vision now. He wasn't lying, puts a Zealot in front of his opponent's base, sends the observer towards his opponent's third, and now he sees a lot of Marines. This might trick him into thinking It's actually still bio. At this point he should know though. He sees the Hellions, be like, hey, wait a second, what is this? He's very slow to understand though. have been taking these gases as well as already the moment you know it's triple CC you want to be going to up to as many gases as possible. Did I miss any damage being done? I might have but he didn't. Two worker kills. Pretty powerful game so far honestly uh not a lot has happened so not a lot of room for mistakes but I mean in general this has this has been uh the play has been good you know been enjoying watching this. I think this is the the first one where in the first seven minutes nothing noteworthy happens. And honestly, I'm not too sad about it. It's nice. It's a change of taste, you know. Just having to relax, not having to think of new inventive insults. Now, as I say that, we see our good friend, Sayo, actually, has 25 of 16 on one base. 74 workers on three base. Of course, is way too much. You should have already taken a fourth base or he should have stopped producing Probes and focus more on unit production. I'm sure what this Probe is doing. Probably going for some vision. Yeah. Now the beautiful thing about having too many Probes is that if you lose them, you still have enough. So this actually is pretty poor micro. Loses way too much. He has Stalkers in position, loses seven workers. Not the biggest of deals because he has 76, but still something to take care of. Now once again, his army composition is completely wrong here. You don't want to be going into Colossi. You want to be going into, if anything, a couple of Colossi, maybe one or two if you build them accidentally, and then start pumping out Immortals, getting Archons and getting Zealots. Because you're playing against someone who's playing, well, basically pure Tank Hellion. The most important thing you can do is push out Immortals. Now, he is getting Observer speed. He's getting a second Robotics Facility as well. Maybe this is Warp Prism speed. I never know the different symbol of it. They look so alike in my head. In that case, if it's Warp Prism speed is good, if it's observer speed, it's also fine. Like it's kind of irrelevant what upgrades you get from there. I'm just not a fan of the Colossi. I'm a big fan of the second Forge. Continuing to get armor upgrades at this point isn't quite as useful. I also don't like how passive he is. If you're playing against a mech player, usually you're the one in charge of the pace of the game. So you want to be kind of skirmish around the edges of his Tank range and trying to pick off stuff. Like you can go here, try to kill some depots, send in four or five zealots over hill while flying in with a Warp Prism. Well, not this area, it's two turrets, but perhaps if there's not enough anti-air, you can even fly your Warp Prism like this into the main base, and then try to do some damage there Like, you really have a lot of opportunity to do stuff because your opponent has such a weak army to move out with So you should always be careful with that Now, we do see the Prism here And oh, he's having a blast, just warping in, warping out No Cannons at any of the bases There's one Cannon here There's no Stalkers here, so recall needs to get used And he does use it properly He managed to kill all of those Hellions So it's okay. His map vision is actually pretty good He didn't lie He has stuff set up It was Warp Prism speed, so I was wrong He isn't continuing upgrades, which, you know, armor upgrades aren't the best, so it's not completely necessary Now, this is obviously a mistake, right? If you're playing against Mech, this kind of Zealot run by should really never do anything And as I say that, he's going to kill workers This setup is fantastic, though He's setting Zealots everywhere Warp Prism barely doesn't make it into the main, but the thought was good The only thing I don't like is that his main army is so small now. And the way he's playing is a fine way to play against Bio, because Bio usually is moving around a bit more and has more trouble dealing with this kind of stuff but against Mech your tanks are going to be able to defend one base basically for free and then this base I thought would do a little more damage and walking into the Planetary Fortress was a mistake so even though I usually always say hey Zealot runbys are good he just lost what 21 Zealots and really didn't kill anything on top of that he lost map control with it His army composition is still kind of crap Like the storm, like I mentioned before, isn't useful. He's warping in Stalkers, which also isn't quite as useful Like, you really want to be getting Archons They tank a lot of tank shots They're very good against Hellbats They're basically just the way to go Now, if you can catch this army while still on siege, it might still be okay for Sayo here, but it is going to be difficult Some with storms as well, completely missing Like, I mean, he has good map vision, but if you're out of position, if you get attacked, even with map vision, it's kind of irrelevant He does not have an Observer with this army either. And I think he's focusing a bit too much on trying to jump on top of this army instead of just trying to find good positions to fight this army Like, you don't need to, if you don't, if you can't fight an army, don't just run into 17 Widow Mines It's not necessary This is really, really painful to watch Like he should just really save up a big force He needs the tech Come on, Sayo You can do it You have an observer here Like this observer is not serving any purpose anymore It sees exactly the same as the Nexus plus a little Just use the observer with your army Clear these Widow Mines I like the addition of the DTs. Might be able to buy some time for, oh man God, I thought it's going to be harassing DTs, it's going to be used for Archons, more stalkers being worked in Stalker is actually absolutely the worst unit you can build in this case, because, like, now that it's more of a Cyclone-based army, it's getting a bit better Like, the opponent is kind of helping Sayo here, get the right army composition He's like, ah, you don't know what to do against tanks You know what? I'll build some Hellion Cyclone Maybe, you know, you already have the right army for that then as a response, Sayo somehow thinks, you know what? Hellion Cyclone or Mine Cyclone, I'll just build more zealots against it. While the way we would actually be to get a couple more Stalkers, if it's this army The problem is Sayo has no vision on his opponent's army He just knows that it's mech, but he doesn't know quite what the composition is Now he's going to figure out, hey, this is a lot of Cyclones, this is a lot of Widow Mines He sees it on the map, reacts to it Now we do have Disruptors Disruptors should be used for zoning What you don't want to do is jump on top of this army You want to use your Disruptor shots to clear the Widow Mines first Don't use your Zealots for that because they will just take damage Still no Observer with this army. Oh, here we go. Observer gets made as well as Observer speed. That's a good play. But it took a while, it took a while. As we see more rotations coming in and even though Seo has very good map vision, if you're lacking map vision in one area and such a major area as this one, you're going to be caught out of position. So now completely caught out of position. We'll most likely need to recall. Actually, he just uses the recall. He doesn't have a recall available. Ah. Doesn't get the recall off. I guess these were the Formula One Cyclones with the quick rotation. Loses his Nexus for free. Once again, mines are trying to get some kills, but keep switching targets targets for a guy Just needs an Observer or something in the middle over here to get full vision Now once again this position actually isn't bad at all for SIO With the two Disruptors, if it just shoots right now, just shoot, just kind of from a distance Do something with your arm up Which one accidentally gets a Cyclone with the other Like what you want to be doing here is you want to be using your range advantage against the Cyclones So you want to use your Colossi and maybe keep a Warp Prism above your Colossi to pick them up every time a Cyclone locks on That's what you're going to be using. And then you still want to be collapsing on top of this army So you send half your Zealots through this side Of course you need to clean up these boys Well, actually, if you send them here, you don't have to And then you come with a big flank from the back The problem with a lot of people is that they always attack from only a single angle And against Mech, you need to come from two angles, especially against tanks So this feels very broken because he has long range but actually what you need to be doing is you need to be coming from two sides and we're having a little this is the one a syndrome. Basically where Protoss players just think that they can only have a single control group and they always need to use it in one position so while he's busy moving back and for non-stop moving forward you just keep moving back and forward into tank fire just lost like 25 supply. Here to blink forward gets a Cyclone who's a six Stalkers, oh, that's a worthy trade It looks like SIO didn't finish elementary school because this elementary map isn't quite as good Here we go again Gets no Cyclone. Loses. Oh, it gets one Cyclone now, gets hit by another 30 times. In the end, you will lose this anyway. So completely indecisive played by Sayo. A lack of understanding of basic math trading six Stalkers for one Cyclone is not actually very useful. This Shield Battery is that's great. Glad you build a Shield Battery. The only is really gonna be a game changer. Instead of that, we should have been setting up, like clearing these mines, he should have been setting up flanks. Hell, he could have even maybe tried some kind of run by to this base again, through this area over here. Warp Prism could have been entering the main base. Usually when you're under pressure, it's actually the best time to start to encounter that, especially against the. maxed terror because it's there's no reinforcements basically if your opponent is maxed and in the case of sago he actually isn't killing anything of his opponent's army so you know it's really good to do to run by this there's nothing at home most likely enough here we go once again the indecisiveness he sees Widow Mines he's a whole that's dangerous and loses another 15 supply loses another Nexus as well in his retreat loses another three four Zealots and every single time they engage um he damages a Cyclone and loses like six seven units so the trades have been going absolutely awful 24k lost against 12k lost and that's with the Terran also having like seven bases while sayo has been struggling to keep five once again this area no vision here right so just guessing where he's going loses a Nexus these Widow Mines so how many kills do you have six kills two kills one kill two kill walking through Widow Mines, no detection whatsoever. I was so happy with this game, but I was so proud Someone doing my build properly And then, just not knowing how to fight, not having detection with him, not being capable of doing stuff Oh my god, these mines are triggering me so much If he's gonna walk into this one, I'll actually That will be it Please now Come on, Sire No, no No, no Okay, I was going to hit the Hit the High Templar It's fantastic It's the clean of the mines They've only been there for five minutes, so very swift reactions Leave this one as well Forget about the three over here. Still no detection here by the way or no detection no vision of this general area which is definitely the most important area there is. Start rebuilding bases which that is good that is good you know his army isn't quite what he needs to be. Tempests are definitely not the answer to the Cyclone Tank like you just just get Immortals and Archons made just Immortals and Archons get some Disruptors to deal with the Cyclones but against tanks like Tank Cyclone you can in this case like there's not enough Cyclones really to do so much damage that you actually need Stalker cobble ceremony Disruptor all you need really is a good engagement to kill all the Tanks and you should be fine. Well no attention really being paid here by sido he's gonna lose this complete arm I can't believe it the perfect build order my build order executed at near perfection the first seven minutes were so sweet. So, it was beautiful. It really was beautiful. It was like watching myself play I was loving it I was like, oh, this is going to be it, boys We're going to be calling Imba on this replay. Terran Mac is broken. Everyone was wrong. Maru was an idiot But no, sadly it isn't the case Good map vision. I'll give him that. It was good map vision. Except the most important area You had no map vision in the middle. How can you say you have good map vision if you're, you're missing the basics This is like saying you've built a great house and then realizing you forgot the roof It's like look at this house and people look at it from the outside. That's a good house you built our, Sajjo Like that's great, you know? Like, can you see it from the inside? And Sajjo's like, just look it from the outside of it And it's like, wow, that looks beautiful, man You're, you're a great house builder, Sajjo Like, please can we see inside and Sajjo? Like, please can we see inside and Sajjo's like, okay, come inside, you know, don't mind the mess And I'm just like, oh, I'm and they come inside, the house is clean, but it's a little cold They're wondering why They look up There's no roof Sajjo, you forgot to build the roof What is this? Right, yeah, I forgot to build the roof, but listen to this. The house is very pretty, right? Like, it looks good, just look around you We ignore the roof Like, yeah, but that's not how it works Like, if you're getting map vision, you need to cover all the main areas Like, I'd rather have a house with full walls and the roof than to have a, a beautiful house without a roof, you know? Like, where I have a simple house that covers the basics, then a very complex house that doesn't cover the basic That's what happened with your house Your house had no roof You missed the middle part of the map, the main area of attack You didn't know if it was going to attack you. You didn't have the proper vision, and thus you really had no vision. Even though you covered 80% of the map, you missed the most important area. Your mistake. Second mistake, your army composition, Zealot, Colossus, Archon. Now, Zealot, Archon is completely fine. Except against the tank count that he had, you're going to need Immortals. You really are going to need Immortals. They're powerful, they kill them fast, they're pretty decent in flank, they can tank a fair amount. Colossi don't do anything. They don't do anything. They are good for splash damage, they're good against units where there's a lot of them, basically. And that wasn't the case here. So Colossus, no, no. Your fights, which was the other thing we were going to pay attention to, don't even get me started I'm I'm gonna be sending you with this with this YouTube video in the comments maybe I'll leave some basic math for you six stalkers for one cyclone is that's a no-no side Joe it's not good I don't want to see that anymore six stalkers is worth more than one cyclone a good trick is to also use supply so cyclone is three and stalkers are two supply now if you get six stalkers that is twelve supply That's a lot more than a cyclone So you just got to think of those numbers a bit. I know it's been a while since you've probably done anything using your brain. But perhaps you should try it Finally, I mean, altogether, yeah, you tried hard You had a good build order This is the most painful thing, is you use such a good build order and you executed the early game so well Then seeing you throw it all away in the mid game, you only leave me one option, my friend. One option and that's that you suck and you suck hard all right boys that was it for today I hope you enjoyed this episode of Is it Imba or do I suck?

        "text": "Hello everyone, welcome back to a new episode of Is it Imba or Do I Suck? Today we're going to be having a look at a replay I got sent to me by Neko Chan And it says, they're harsh them I'm a 4.8k MMR player and struggle a lot with closing the game out once I get Broodlords Every game that I manage to get Broodlords, I still die It seems like ZVP is nearly unwinnable for Zerg Due to the lacking mobility of Broodlord, you can't get across the map without losing at least two bases to Zealots How am I supposed to win the game in this way? Please, I need your help Broodlords need a movement speed buff. Otherwise, this matchup is just straight and playable without all Imba. And that was sent to me by Mr Necco-chan. All right, let's have a look At this game, then, if it is so unbeatable indeed. ProDol's wing zero He's opening up with a standard one gate expand This is around a 5K MMR replay Like he said, he was 4 8, I think the Protoss was 5K So relatively high level. I think it means they're maybe Masters 1 or on the border from Masters 2 to Masters 1 Let's speed this up this beginning part a bit This all seems pretty standard, honestly. honestly you know the Protoss most likely will just be going either into some Stargate or some Twilight action and you see the Zerg just opening up with well what looks to be a standard two into three base after the initial two queens here goes our drone takes a third base so so far looks pretty standard looks pretty powerful a little move you can do as a Zerg is that well in the case of a stalker first not so much but otherwise you could try to run by two Lings into the main base Again, Stalker first can be a little tricky Hello, pay attention, there we go So yeah, it's gonna be The thing you can still do is you can always leave like a Ling here and a Ling here and then if he starts moving out like this with a Stalker, you can perhaps sneak by into the main base, try to get vision I also don't mind the Overlord speed, honestly I think it's a safe call You will always get the information that you need And yeah, we see Necco Chan is going to to probably be able to scout the Stargate Might lose an Overlord for it, but that's just the way of the world Only a Ling, actually he should be able to just go to this general area and be safe No, doesn't do that, we'll lose the Overlord instead. Scout Oracle first has no real links on the map. That's good, as there's no real Adept count on the map either, so Oracle's going to be the only form of pressure here. The way to beat that is spores and good queen movement. Spores are here, let's have a look at the queen movement. In general, this is an important area to defend, and this is a general area that you want to be defending with your queens, because those are the drone transfers, which isn't defended by spores. So far, Neko Chen is doing all of that. Completely fine. Protoss players getting a fast Robotics Facility and fast gases, and then we'll be going into a third base, from what it looks like. So pretty standard build order, slightly faster Robo than maybe we're used to, but both players seem to know their stuff You know, they have build orders that make sense They're doing moves that make sense Yeah, so far, honestly, a pretty normal game Robo timing is perfect 4:30 is a good robo warp-in timing if it is two Oracles If it is a single Oracle, we'll get it slightly earlier, maybe around 4:20 And we see Wing Zero trying to do some damage Now, this is where we can see the scale of the Oracle pulls away the drones I was going to say you need to pull away the drones from where the Oracle comes in and Necco Chan actually managed to do that. So so far we're having a pretty clean game by both players You know, no major errors Perhaps the map vision that we have from Wing Zero is a little small I wouldn't mind seeing one Ling over here, one Ling over here and then a patrolling Ling in this area That way you get a lot of vision You create a lot of vision for yourself on the map, which is important Yeah, basically that vision Good stuff Now this is a late Drone pool Another thing I don't like that Nico Chen isn't doing is that there's no Overlord in this area This is a very common spot for Oracles to come from So one of your Overlord should be there You basically want everything covered. This is a good Overlord This is a good Overlord If you also want an Overlord here, so you can see this happening The rest should be covered by creep a creep, don't forget, gives vision Now this is a rookie mistake Never want to lose your Queen just like that Obviously out in the open, single Queen chasing three Oracles Even this is dumb because now you're exposing your own mineral line So very bad Queen movement here in the past 15 seconds and it could have cost him a bit more The Wing Zero would have committed there, maybe microed away his weak Oracle Would have been able to kill like five, six workers extra. Now I think he got maybe six in total and he got a Queen So still pretty decent here for Wing Zero by some messed up Queen micro by Nekochan who's going into what looks like to be Ravager Ling Bane with a I'm sure this is a macro hatch in the main base I guess not a big fan of that but I'll accept it whenever you take a fourth base this early you always are going to need a Spore Crawler because otherwise it's just going to get abused by Oracles luckily for Nekochan this isn't working yet or this isn't happening yet But the Oracles still are active so perhaps later it might happen What is the scouting info? Scouting info is absolutely zero. So at this point you could say wow look at his barcode account that's so nice It's 74 It's pretty high He's getting Infestation Pit but he did all of that without having any information He didn't know if the gases were there. You're allowed to go up to like 75 76 drones and get an Infestation Pit if you see that there are gases there otherwise you probably want to be building a couple more units like 75 drones is fine but the Infestation Pit is truly pushing it now um the one thing that i do see that is lacking is creep spread we really haven't been pushing creep spread at all and the thing that creep spread gives us of course is vision as well gives us vision improved army movement still no Spore Crawler here at this base and now the three Oracles are just going to kill i guess all three Queens and we'll be able to be able to to take out a bunch of Drones as well. Drones should probably have been pulled away already as well. If Wing Zero was paying attention here, all of these would have fallen. Might still actually go for a couple. Yeah, this is very, very poor defending here by by Necco Chan who loses three Queens or two Queens and also loses another five, six Drones, another five Drones. So I'm kind of liking Wing Zero's position here. He's going into Storm, me. He's going into Blink, which I think is a mistake. Should have obviously be Charge. He does have Charge already. I'm not sure why he's getting Blink. It's not as great. Yeah, I could say there's not a lot that, like not a lot of big things that Necco Chan is doing wrong. It's more that he isn't doing a lot of things Like he's not spreading creep There's no pressure whatsoever on the Protoss base Like the last time he was on the map with any kind of Lings was, well, never really Like he hasn't been trying to clear probe lines with Baneling run by, there hasn't been a single Baneling drop So the question really is what has he been doing because he hasn't been defending his base properly, hasn't been spreading creep, and he hasn't been harassing So I really wonder what he's been spending his time with His injects seem to be okay, but I mean that's only every 20 seconds. He also has, I mean, his MMR is pretty high, right? 340 MMR, but maybe just moving his army back and forth in a really intense way Because it just seems like he hasn't been doing anything at all Like this is the first thing that he's actually done, where he splits up part of his army He does get a bunch of Zealots for his effort, so that's nice He does have a big Baneling Ravager Roach Force as well, which is kind of sitting here, not doing anything managed to find this part of his opponent's army I just love to see like a Baneling run by being started or just a Baneling problem just anything to put some pressure on the opponent. The way you want to be playing with Roach Ravager Ling Bane is you kind of want to be doing constant Baneling run-bys and constant Baneling attacks on different bases while you're attacking into Brood Lords as the safety measure So after you kill 30 workers and your opponent attacks you, you're going to be surviving on Brood Lords That's really the big plan here, but it seems like Nico Chan, he kind of wants to fight with his army, he builds 12 more Roaches, which also isn't really the way The main way to deal damage with a Baneling army, or with a Baneling Roach Ravager Army, or Baneling army is to get Banelings, like the rest of your army is kind of garbage. Banelings are the driving force behind your army basically Now, um, Like I said, we haven't really been seeing any harassment whatsoever Once plus two finishes, this is going to count twofold, basically, or tenfold Like, Baneling run by has become so much more powerful because a single Baneling will be able to one shot a probe and one shot probe clumps So, yeah, Baneling run bys like these are extremely important And basically the reason why you'd play a style with this many Banelings is to kill workers a lot A good trick is to come from two sides. So some Banelings from the front, some Banelings from the other side because otherwise they'll just be able to escape like not quite an escape so this was actually a good run by still the execution could be better but the result was perfect so I'm not going to complain about that too much now the way you want to be playing Broodlord against this style once again is you want to be continuously doing Ravager Ling bane pokes at outside basis to contain your opponent on a low base count And then the Broodlords, they really just are there as a safety mechanism so you can't die It's basically so the other guy can be all right. I'm going to move across the map, A move you with Storm and Archons That's what the Broodlords are for And you're just constantly doing run bys with your Banelings, with part of your Roach army And then as a third group, you're going to fly around with a group of Corruptors, like 12, 13 Corruptors and two, three Vipers And whenever you're attacking a base, imagine The Zerg attacks this base with his Roach Bane force, or mainly Banes, and the Protoss moves into that direction, and the Corruptor Viper comes from the right side over here Boom, you abduct with the Vipers, and then you try to get air units like that And then if he attacks you, you obviously have the Broodlords. A mistake a lot of people make is that they attack with the Broodlords, and then they lose them because Broodlords are slow, they're not that great of unit They need a lot of support to be able to do something Now we see small Zergling runbys, but not really the Baneling run bys that we need It really feels like Nechok Chan isn't doing anything Like he's in the game, but he's there physically, you know, but mentally he's not really there Stuff is happening and he's watching it happen It's a bit like his life in a way where, you know, it just seems to be going by without any real improvement That's kind of what's happening here as well. It's like, yeah, this is nice, this is good You know, this is the stuff I want to see, but I want to see this consistently I want to see this army doing stuff as well I guess if you're being attacked, it's okay, to stay home, but Yeah, this is, these are the run bites you should have been seeing basically consistently for the past five, six minutes Now the toss is too far on creep, doesn't have an Oracle with him, so this honestly shouldn't be too successful for Wing Zero here As a Protoss player, quick tip Always get an Oracle so you can tag the Broodlords You can see the position of the Corruptor It helps a lot against this kind of stuff. Trust me on that, boys Yeah, this is a good fight for Necco Chan, honestly, who is also up in workers now And now you might think, oh, he just won a big fight You know what time it is? It's time to move across the map with Broodlords But let me tell you something, boys It's never time to move across the map with Broodlords The time, the way you move across the map with Broodlords is by pushing creep forward and getting tense spores in this area, then you move forward with Broodlords But in order to be forward with Broodlords on the map, you're going to need more static defense at your different bases So zealot runbys can do too much. You're going to need some kind of momentum on your side so that your opponent can't really be attacking your Broodlords as they're moving with his Tempest Like you want to be basically very safe and then you can move in And then with a Spore or Infestor support, you should be able to win fights But never just randomly fly across the map with your Broodlords This is kind of how you want to be using them, just staying at home, doing run-bys It seems like Nikko-chan is doing a way better job than before The only problem is that he doesn't really have any static defense So he's also quite vulnerable to run-bys himself He isn't the quickest to respond. He took him a couple of seconds here and he lost, well, 57 workers already, and I think he lost like 35 in the last minute and a half, or the last half a minute These four Zealots clear the whole mineral line There's a five Zealots over here that clear the whole mineral line So this is a little bit dangerous and this is why I always say, just get some spines or just be very active with your units on the map, trying to catch your opponent's units Creep helps a lot of course Creep and Overlord is basically free map map hack, it gives you complete vision of the map and always try to get the spines up before it happens. Preventing is better than curing in this case where you can't really start building spines while you're being run by it. That's not how it works. Yeah, he's just, right now Neko-chan is just being completely pulled apart, almost. Doesn't pull his workers away, can't defend his fifth base, loses his natural as well, queen's going down, I mean, there's Greater Spire, it shouldn't go down, but, With the speed that Neko-chan is operating at, it might accidentally. Yeah, there we go. Greater Spire will also fall. The thing is that in order to win this kind of game, you've really got to play consistently well as both sides. So you can't be taking bad fights on the other side of the map. What you want to be doing is you kind of want to be controlling the middle of the map with a main army and then the rest of the game is just run-bys, run-bys, while you're pushing your advantage forward So, Protoss is trying to deny creep, which is what this Protoss is doing, while doing run-bys Zerg is trying to establish creep while doing run-bys Now, the problem for Zerg here is that he isn't doing run-bys, and he isn't establishing creep So that's a zero out of two of the things he should be doing He needs more workers as well at this point I mean, 47 workers is simply not enough Now his army composition is also awful. Somehow he managed to get back into well basically 32 roaches, 26 roaches, six Ravagers, which is absolutely the worst unit to have into the late game The roach is a two-supply unit that if you have 25 of them might barely be able to kill a single Immortal So it's not the unit you really want to have in your late-game army They also stack up naturally, they're terrible against base defense, they're kind of slow, they're kind of stupid No one really likes them And in common, they don't really do too much with Broodlord either I mean, they don't synergize well with Broodlord Unlike the Infestor, for example, the Corruptor synergizes relatively well. Now, this is the kind of desperate attack that you would expect from a man who is down 30 workers and forgot that Run By exist in this game. And it's kind of what we're seeing, you know? Like Roach, Baneling, Corruptor, Broodlord gets across the map get shut down by Tempest. This is a very common scenario where the Protoss loses a base and kills basically every single air unit and every single Broodlord. And if you don't lose the workers as the Protoss, that's honestly completely fine because you can just rebuild the base. You lose your income for a minute, so there's like 800 minerals and maybe 300 gas. But you're killing so much more with your Tempest that it's completely irrelevant then. I mean, the problem really started with the Zealots running by and there being no adequate response And on top of that the complete lack of grief threat also isn't helping The army composition is terrible And the decision making with what to do with the main army has honestly also been a bit lackluster So we're just making this massive list of mistakes and we have this list of things that went well and I'm not even quite sure what they're right on The first five minutes were relatively good, you know Didn't lose too many workers to the Oracles, only lost a single Queen It could be considered okay. Now, at this point, I could go on and on about what Nico Chen is doing wrong, but the thing here is that nothing, he's pretty dead, right? He is a Roach Corruptor army at 19 minutes in game against 11 Tempests. It's like, I'm not quite sure what I say. I'm not quite sure I've never seen this before. This is a composition you play against Terran Mech, if you're all-inning the Terran Mech who opened Battlecruiser. But this is not a composition you play against Protoss. Like roaches are really, really bad the longer the game goes on. Corruptors are okay, but you need something with them, you know? The problem with this army is that roaches can only attack ground and they're really bad at it, and Corruptors can only attack air. And they're okay at attacking air, but you don't. actually care too much about the Tempest you know they're there are to ground damage isn't that great if you don't have Broodlords you just kind of ignore them Corruptors almost get a shot in very exciting fight here as Nico Chen realizes that Void Rays actually can shoot up. There's a dang stupid Tempest. Yeah this is one of the sadder fights and at this point Nico Chen is not only wasting Wing Zero's time he's also wasting his own time but more importantly is wasting my time and all of course time as well. It's like, mate, the game is over. It's time to leave. Do yourself a favor. And just quit. It's over. Five Corruptors. The other guy has nine Tempest. It's time to go, my friend Gigi Perfect. All right Well, my tonal voice perhaps reveals a little bit already. What's going to be happening here. But Niko, Niko, Niko, Niko, you were talking about short ninjas and being all funny but to be real with you this was very sad you play a race that is known for having fantastic vision creep Overlord Zergling spread all across the map very easy to get a lot of vision high-speed army yet none of it no vision you had no creep no good Overlord spread you had no Zerglings on the map started doing run-bys at the nine-minute mark you. You didn't consistently do them Didn't ever use Corruptor Viper You attacked with Broodlords. In the late game you built 32 roaches. That's the one that hurt the most. Roaches don't shoot up. They only shoot the ground. Against the air units show something different. No spores, no spines, no hydras. You were floating 3K at one point, still no spines. Didn't respond at all to run bys. You can pull away your drones if you're being run by it, by the way. That's a good move. You want to save them. It's okay if you lose an extractor and a hatchery. But 30 drones, that's a lot of drones. It's difficult to replace. Yeah, to me it's obvious. To the viewers is obvious. The only one that just doesn't believe it yet is you. Let me tell you. You really do suck, my friend. You really do suck. You suck. All right. That was great. Thanks everyone for watching. I hope you did enjoy it. If you did, feel free to subscribe to my YouTube channel. Don't forget to smack the like button and leave a comment down below what you thought about Nico Chan's play as well. Was it a thumbs up or was it a thumbs down? Yeah, it's interesting questions. And I'll see everyone next time for a new episode of, is it Imba? No, wait, a new episode of something else, which I can't think of. Ah, YouTube play Starcraft. There we go. Tomorrow. That's great. Bye-bye. Thank you."

        "text": "Hello, welcome back to a new episode of Is It Imba or Do I Suck? And today we got a little email from a guy called Deceit Now, let's read it. Arstam, I'm your Chinese fan. You have to watch this game I played in Hanbock recently. The opponent was building his air force from the beginning. I defended and interfered throughout the game. However, he could defend and counterattack me with waves of air force until I can't stop Yamato's power, creating waves of air force with a bunch of Missile Turrets. I cannot attack at all. After I dried my minerals in army, he still has a bunch of BC, or Terran happy ship in Chinese. I have no way but to surrender. In Vati, has one hell of a new one, my friend Thank you very much for that What's your nickname again? The Seed Now let's have a look at the see if Terran actually is completely broken because he does make a good point The Air Force of Terran is too strong Humans of course, very good at making air forces Good old Terrans, all the same Now, usually if you think about the Air Force from a Zerg perspective, what are the things that counter them? The Air Force, you know, you get your Infestors, you get your early game, well, midgame, you get your Corruptors, perhaps into Vipers, some Infestors. These are the units we want to be building against the Terran Air Force, right, to break them. Perhaps we want some stuff on the ground as well to be able to kill, I don't know, tanks and Cyclones. Hellions that come there as support. Let's have a look exactly what our friend the Seed is doing. So our friend the Seed is just a solid Zerg player, you know. He's going about his day, building his Hatcheries, building his Queens, building his Lings, building his Roaches, or Drones, Roaches. So we see, I'm sure how you pronounce this. I can't read. Um, our Terran friend, just swapping into Hellions, double gas, probably Triple Starport at some point, started building up his air force. I wouldn't be surprised that they can either be done through BCs or through Banshee or, I guess in some weird way also with a Liberator or two and then going into something afterwards, but that's kind of unlikely, honestly A lot of the time when you see Mass Air, it's gonna come either from a Banshee or a Battlecruiser opener Meanwhile we have our friend Deceit who is not really playing a build order that I've ever seen before So he gets the second queen, or the third queen he gets in the main base, which is kind of bad. You always want to get it in your natural so you can throw one tumor here, then, you know, get two queens at your natural and your queen can inject the natural His third base should have already started a long time ago He's completely supply locked at 44 supply and he's building 10 Lings. I guess for for Hellion and Rhumbys that makes some sense. I like the ten things none don't hate it too much. Problem really is third base is too late. Queen was being built in wrong position so we got two minor errors already and the supply block still goes on happily floating six 700 minerals into two quick Overlords nice. This is the kind of stuff I see a lot you know people complaining about the unit composition and then being supply blocked for the first five minutes in the game. It's not a unit composition, my friend. It's your mechanical skill. Which the seed is lacking a bit. You see a solid thousand mineral float at the 4 minute mark. Didn't even know you mined that many minerals already at this point. You get a lot of money in this game. You really know how much money you're getting in a game if you see someone float like 1K at 4 minute 30. And he still actually has some stuff as well. I mean, he is a natural saturated. There's another queen on the way, Baneling Nest. I don't know what this is. If it's for macro hatch in the main base. I mean, it makes sense if it's loading this much money. I don't mind that too much. Gets a couple of spores now. How's his scouting bin? This is the first time he scouts. A quick tip for all the Zergs out there. Usually the buildings are going to be built around the initial Barracks because that Barracks will also be building either the Tech Lab or the Reactor for the next building. So the seed being out here, you know, it's not, not really helping. You want to be moving to the right, my friend. This area of the base has been spotted by now. You can leave and try to find something else to see it. Hello? Over here, there's two Starports with Banshees. I don't want to figure that out. No, all right. That's fine. That's okay. That's completely fine. Just stay over here. I do like that he's adding a couple of extra Queens A lot of the time in ZVT you will see Zergs actually going up to I don't know like seven eight Queens sometimes even nine Queens so yeah I don't mind it high Queen count is pretty good defense a lot of stuff Hellion Hellbat stuff now the Roach Warren is one that I honestly don't even mind the only problem I have is that A his worker count is extremely low for no real reason So he lost only 16 Lings, no Drones whatsoever He just hasn't really been producing Drones, randomly building things. Now the reason I don't mind the Roach Warren is because you're going to need some anti-ground at some point as well A lot of the time the air stuff comes with ground stuff Well, at this point the Zerg really isn't quite aware of what's happening as its Overlord right now He's been building a new home in this general area Like he started the construction of his house, that's how long he's been here It's gonna get a permanent residence card soon in the Terran base Been applied for that, the five minute mark The process takes about a minute as well And now soon he will get his permanent Oh! Oh no He's moving I'm glad I got to witness that. It's one of those things. You only get to witness once in a lifetime is the Zerg's Overlord actually scouting. It's like when the moon blocks the sun, you know? Or like a meteor shower, something like that. One of those rare events in a lifetime where the Zerg actually decides to scout. Now he's like, oh, crap, triple Starport, how could I have known? It's so difficult to scout Terran. They're so good at denying it. And now there's already five Banshees out. So, I mean, in theory, this should still be fine, right? Our boy, the Zerg built six Queens. There is a Lair, so this sounds like you build one Overseer. You cool all your Queens to your main base. And we're gonna be in one hell of a spot, no? Spire on the way I wouldn't mind seeing some of this money spent into Drones as well There's some of the 70 Larva I was gonna complain about this Injects The issue is just that he doesn't even use his Larva Hello? Can you use the Queens to defend, perhaps, my friend? Hello? Boys? The siege units really don't like leaving their house They're all afraid of the real world These two Queens are having to control with Banshee Well, let them do That's fine I mean, this guy's like, well, I guess if you're not gonna fight, that's fine No Overseer Spore Crawler positioned out of the mineral line into this general area. It can help pull for that better There is a Ling run by here, which, I guess, these two Liberators will be able to clean up eventually I mean, this is just really sad because the units to defend are here, you know? There's plenty of units Wait, what happened with this Spire? I guess it got cancelled Maybe it was building the main I knew there was a Spire on the way already I mean, this Ling run by is doing a lot of damage because there's literally not a single ground unit out for the Terran player This is the most opportunistic, Baneling morphing that I've seen in a moment my life I'm getting drilled to death by one of those bad boys. I can't believe he's actually going to lose this base with four Banshees Well, he's had the queens available all the time Like at this point, he still has a Lair as well so he can still build the Corruptor here Instead, it's a Hive just to build more Drones and wait for the Spire to finish The good old sack my base against the four Banshee around because I don't want to use tools to be in a way that's pretty nice by this make the game a bit more balanced by not giving one of the most OP units in the game with me He's like, you know what, I think I can win this game without the two bases. Eventually, after the Lair finishes, or after the Lair dies, he comes through drones I guess I really do need to send my drones there He's not really paying attention to his game He's trying to go for the spire, it doesn't quite work Now, you might be thinking, well, this game is completely over Like, you know, the supplies are awful, work account is basically even, which is not good for Zerg Zerg's only on two bases Well, you know, you can't really count this, you know But he'd take a look at the bank that my boy, the seat, has been acquiring over the past nine minutes and 45 seconds in this game 3,000 minerals are here He has eight larvae still. He could just be double expanding at this point, getting an eco Like, I think if you give this to a good Zerg player, he'd be able to be in an to a decent situation within something like a minute and a half I love that the Terran's way of dealing with that Overlord was to initially build a turret here, chase the Overlord to this area and then build a second turret rather than sending one Liberator to click the Overlord I think that is a real dedication to the least effective use of your units That's as powerful to see and I'm glad I got to witness this Meanwhile we have the seat is relaxing You know, he's taking things slow Doesn't want to hurry things. He's one of those guys that if you ever get into a relationship with, he's still going to, you know, doesn't want to be moving in with you after 10 years. He's one of the slow ones, you know. Marriage after 25 years. Then perhaps after 30 or 35 years of being together, he can start thinking about kids. By that time you're 85 and life is practically like, don't get into a relationship with a guy like this. He doesn't inject. He's slow. And he does have lots of money, so I guess that makes some sense, eh? What's the cash in the bank? He's spending his cash. He's a very frugal person, doesn't like to spend. He's just not doing anything. I wonder what he looks at If he would look at this replay, if he just sit there and say, yeah, this looks alright Maybe just like zooms in or something Like, see the graphics I used to do this when I was younger I changed the graphics in the game and then see how the units change They have extra bubbles on their head It's also fun, but it's a different kind of thing Perhaps something like the Sims or Animal Crossing would be more suited to your needs than the SC2 We finally have a 4th base out It's only been 12 minutes and a money bank constantly over 3K to be able to achieve that 4th base I like that he's spreading creep as well. I think that's big Actually, we have a Nydus on the way It is a very vital location for the Terran So if this Nydus goes up, this could spell Doom for the Terran to attack this So this No, awesome. no base there It's to secure this general area, this Nydus is going to be really useful He could use it to do a run by in here, but he also could have just ran the Lings there Probably would have been a faster process I'm so happy I got this replay Because one Nydus wasn't good enough yet, he's gonna wait for this Nydus to pull No, he's gonna send out all of the roaches and then the second Nydus pulled. This guy's like, hey, why is no one using me? Oh no, the Corruptors flying over, realizing, oh no, they're invisible. And we don't have detection. Detection coming in a little too late. Banshees fly away with the speed of light, of course. Here comes the run by boys. 12 turrets in case these Lings suddenly start to fly. I mean, this is a good run back. It definitely is. Or a Nydus. This is what we need. Don't use this one that we already have. Build a new one. I like them. Still no worker count. I mean, this was... This was good fight. You see that a good run. We're proud of you to see. I'm not going to be sarcastic about this one. It's a really good run by Like you feel like 15 hundred million worth of turret, 12 SCVs. The only problem I have is that we're building roaches and lings against a guy that literally is producing air. Like you said, this is an Air Force, my friend. And right now, you're supplying your army with swords and Your swords and sticks, sticks and stones. And they realize now that This is absolutely one of the best fights I've seen in my life. Yeah, instead, he finally starts to to realize that you can actually hit air with lings. So as a result we're getting into an infestation pit. How many 25 Larva why aren't you using them? I have a feeling this seat doesn't actually hotkey as hatcheries Because if he just hotkeyed his hatcheries, like producing units with Zerg is so easy Like it's actually the easiest way to produce like once you once you have the Larva like that's the hard part, you know, the injecting is Like he's injecting It's so sick to me how Like 3011, you could have so many Drones, so many units 8 more Corruptor on the way, 11 are out already I do like that there's Corruptor here I have some issues with the upgrades on this Corruptor, though, I see There is not And we see plus three air weapons. plus three air weapons, plus two armor for the Thor Yeah, obviously with your 20 Corruptor or your 11 Corruptor, you're not going to be able to win that I also wouldn't mind seeing some spellcasters, some Infestors, some Vipers, some scouting on this base, this top base, this island base Actually what are we seeing? I guess the only points that we have right now are these two Nydus A fifth base is up, 16 minutes in game Not quite connected with creep, but 12 Spores Yes, sir Keep him coming Does spend a big chunk of his money though, which is I mean, it's also kind of nice to do that Well, it's not nice to build Spores, but it's nice that Just getting drones now! How about we done that about 10 minutes ago? Look at that Spores everywhere Clean this up, how many Spores is this? 23 Spores Nice This is the first time he's actually at a healthy drone count I don't understand why it had to take so long I really don't know Oh my god This guy managed to find the only Spore without a war, because I think it's quite impressive as well How many Corruptors are still on the map? There's the wrong buttons 24 Corruptors No upgrades against 3-3 upgrades 11 Vikings, 6 Battlecruisers, 9 Liberators This is going to be a rough game for the Zerg, my friends It's going to be a very rough game. The sickest thing is if we would just send the Corruptors here and just pee on this Command Center You'd probably get it anyway I like the Vipers, I don't mind it I wouldn't have mind it seeing a second I didn't have mind at seeing a second Spire for double upgrades This is one of those things where I've seen this before, where Zerg players are not Zerg players, just lower level players, they're like, ah, I'm too far behind in upgrades already, no use trying to catch up. That's not actually how this game works though. It's a good It's not how this works, but you need to You need to try catching them. It's still better to have only one upgrade than to have zero upgrades all game long. Trust me on that like that. I've done the mathematics on that Jesus The turtling The ring of fire I bet this is what the Zerg is doing as well I'm just trying to copy his behavior Because really nothing is happening in the thing. Just looking at animations and in human. In unit graphics, who did a drone move? Like it's floating. Is you doing a little dance? I never actually watched that Very rhythmic unit, the drone Or is it like his wings flapping in the air? That's crazy It's like they're swimming. Like some weird fish. Well, honestly, I don't think this Zerg can really do anything here. I like the attempt. I like this. I think this is big. After being at home and looking at his Corruptor, like animation in the wind, getting all of his Vipers to full energy. After four minutes of doing nothing, he decides it's time for another Nydus in this location. Because that worked out really well before, remember, he had these four Nydus Worms here, really being able to cover a lot of ground. Planetary Fortress, this is... This is really how I imagine the Gold League and the Bronze League to me. It's like things are happening and no one really knows what is happening. Just F2 is back home for three Lings with this entire army. This is quality. I want more of these replays. Four queens, they've been working on the creep spread for real. The last time that this guy, the Terran, decided to do some, some creep denial was probably at the 14 minute mark and back then the creep was over here. So in the past six minutes, I think we at least got one extra ring of tumors now, maybe two extra rings of tumors. We managed to connect the four or this was the third, the third base with the fifth. Hey, that's an upgrade. That's an upgrade. That's the second spire like he's listening. Terran meanwhile completely content with just staying at home, not doing anything. I think I feel like both of them like just accidentally went into the multiplayer game. Just wanted to play single player without an opponent, just build stuff up and take pictures These are the guys that create the box art, I'm telling you Now the art on the box where you see like an epic scene, like that's just what both of them are doing They're setting it up It's like you zoom in Like I can I zoom in, zoom in, change the camera a bit and then you put it with like one Battlecruiser over here a Viking and Liberator here and take a screenshot And just like that you got Box Art On the other hand, same thing Oh, this doesn't look quite as pretty I think you need Broodlords for box art and an Infestor or something. 4K4K in the bank for our good friend, The Seat, who is getting a second Lair in case his first Lair, well, in case his Hive dies Maybe he isn't aware that You know some buildings they say the requirement is a Lair So maybe he thinks if you have a Hive you need to rebuild the Lair again That would be fantastic I wouldn't mind that I think that would be a good way to go about things, an improvement to the game I'm not on speed is up a bit because I'm not sure what I'm marching honestly Like neither of them really are playing the game They're just He's playing SimCity at this point and I don't know if the Zerg is still playing, honestly, like he hasn't really done very much in the past I don't know Just this whole game basically Oh, here comes the Baneling Right with the back there Base falls Bio upgrades on the way for the Terran Nice The thickest thing is that this Terran isn't actually moving out either Meaning that the Zerg might actually have a chance Okay, I lied He's moving out now Now This is the moment everyone has been waiting for The epic fight 35 Starports, 5-5-3 Plus 1 upgrades against 3-3 air The Zerg flying forward with his Vipers and his Corruptors The Terran slowly sharking around the map Tud-d-doo-doo Trying to get that unsuspecting Zergling But he goes back instead. Back to the shark hole Oh, man Oh, nukes Three nukes at the same time Is this a meme? Did he actually have three nukes in store? Yes, five and three nukes at once But, look at this This is why he built a Lair here because in that case it will survive three nukes There of course is more HP, this is brilliant Here I was complaining, but actually it was brilliant Now there is 2-1 upgrades done right now for the Zerg Who could have been slightly more active on the map perhaps or just doing things in general? I'm just going to speed this up again I can't believe what I'm watching. I'm really sad there was no MMR written down because I am very curious what kind of level this is now, oh, seeing some action? No, the side's against it Don't want to get too close with our opponent Maybe he's a pacifist, like the people that don't like war? He just wants to happily coexist A bit like switch or nothing, you know, they declare himself neutral that we're not joining That's what the C is trying to do as well When he gets attacked, he defends his border His borders are the creep Which he doesn't even like expanding his borders very much, you know, with the speed of his creep spread. And then after he defends his borders, he's like, all right, like, this is it Like, I'm not gonna attack you, I'm good now He's insane I want to be able to do that I can't actually believe that this is a game the two people played Another gaming run down into a base that still has 500 MMR That's been 800, 800 Killing gas mining anymore Nice Two nuke bad Yeah, that's got a bit more Two nukes rating down from the sky Two more nukes going to run Oh no Wait, will it land? Suicide by nuke That's gotta be a first Oh, we have a push forward decide it's time to go in What are that progress? 3-2. Okay, so we have the time now. And we have our 50 SCV dropping the solid one thick before to fly, while still filling 7K, 5K, 7 9 larvae and above. But he's not next. Oh! Parasitic Bomb is a good bomb, yes. Fly away while your Parasitic Bomb does the work. Maybe try to do an abduct when they fly away, but why would you be engaging? But why would you be engaging when your Parasitic Bomb is doing the work? You can throw another Parasitic Bomb by the way. It doesn't have to be limited to one of the down. How much energy you can go two or three more? Oh, and keep taking energy from your spores, I guess. Not from this place, it's a problem of that 45 Corruptors in the right. Why isn't you're using these guys? Hello? Viper? No? The game is gonna last even longer. I think this is what torture looks like. I think I could withstand a lot of things, you know? I think it could withstand a lot. I've seen once a thing, but I've seen once a thing, they put a drop of water on your head like every minute or so like it or like every 30 seconds. Like you can't move and then a drop of water hits her every 30. So there's a lift on. And after four hours the guy was like, okay, I can't take it anymore. Like it's actually driving me like. I'm gonna hard I think I could last longer than four hours with that But if you'd show me this game on repeat, which I'm not even sure if this game is ever gonna end, right? I guess if you just show this game to me, I think I would immediately confess to all the secrets, like I'd give them my government information, whatever they want Because you're starting to doubt reality when you watch a game like this At this point, I doubt anyone is still watching as well It's just me talking to myself about a game that We do all 20 battles and caliport to deal with 15 Lings Right now, let's do some counting 43 Corruptors, 7 Vipers. Now you can throw parasitic bombs, you can use Neurals There's a lot of things you can do But you gotta use some spellcasters Just going straight Corruptor usually doesn't work Just attack man Imagine this is what it looks like when two people that just don't want to fight, they define each kind Oh and as I say that the Zerg decides to run into the opponent's time Twenty three-year-matter, so all at the same time We tilled six Battlecruisers, seven Battlecruisers, it was funny to He can throw eight Battlecruisers and he lost 43 Look at his army, the last time. Now, my favorite thing of all time would be if he just straight rallies his Corruptors back in again because that would mean this misery will come to an end. But I have a feeling he's not going to be doing that. I have a feeling we're going to be here for at least another 10 minutes looking at the MULEs mining out this space. Then the MULEs mining out this space. And deserve actually 32 minutes in boys. Look at this. This is where we were with the creep spread after I think, well let I say, 16 minutes or so. Then this was 23 minutes, 25, 28, 33. So every three minutes he puts down one ring of Creep Tumors. You know he pushes all the creep tumors forward Nice Expanding the borders We have more ghosts, nuking a base that isn't mining anymore Oh, no, I don't want to be moving out until we repaired every single Battlecruiser back to full help But let's not use more than one SCV, shall be boys Single SCV will do the kill It's actually repairing, that's happening I can see it I feel like they're going up in hell, but No, no 90 workers right now for the Zerg Yes, a couple more turrets is what we needed I was getting worried that 12 turrets was enough I don't even know anymore. You know, I always thought becoming a professional gamer was a good career, but I'm trying to really rethink my priorities in life right now. Thinking of joining like the monks, you know, in a monastery. Doing some deep meditation or something. Get big into mindfulness. I just study philosophy, find the meaning of life, and see if it includes watching 36 minutes from the sea, and a Terran name, I still don't know what it means. I don't think any philosopher has got the production of conclusion, but this is true. You know how no one really knows the meaning of life, but I think we can rule out some options. I think this would be one of the options. of the options that we could definitely rule out is watching this game 37 minutes in I'm still alive My vital organs are still working, but it can be for much longer If you run one more Baneling run by into a Planetary Fortress actually going to end it I'll just be done I'm not even sure if I want to see the final fight I understand Okay, there's Infestors here There's neural You could neural stuff You can use Parasitic Bomb Yeah, neural Parasitic Bomb Look at this These Infestors are doing big words Imagine they have more than that I imagine if he used his Viper I imagine he used this cat though I think this is it I think this is it. This is how suffering is. If he goes back home, because he's afraid of the Protoss man I'm gonna find this name because I'm flaming so hard on Battle.net I will spend the rest of my life searching for this Battlecruiser and sending an angry Battlecruiser. He was going up there. Yes, don't understand. Yes, a new range to the affair. I can't believe this game is actually this close. Like, if he actually would use his Infestor, if he uses his Infestor, if he uses his Corruptors, his Corruptors, It actually would be in a pretty decent ball. Oh no, this game is going to go on. Wait, does the Zerg win? I can't believe I've been bamboozled by this Terran sending me this replay, saying that Battlecruiser is impossible to beat, and now is up 60 supply. The game is gonna go on. I'm actually starting to doubt if this game ever ends. The Terran and this guy are actually still playing. They just cut up the game in two parts so they can send me the first part while they're playing the second part at home right now. This replay got sent to me two weeks ago, but they're still there in-game on Purity and Industry. Is this something else? I wonder after they're done with a set like this, but they didn't think to themselves, oh, that was a good thing. Here come the gas, the Infestors He's running out of money though He almost mined everything This base still has some minerals No more gas gas this base has some gas and mineral so he says he killed a few he's going to be taking this base I'm a fan honestly just use the kill by the why do you have 90s there are fascinating here come the Vipers I say, don't crash I don't have a lot I don't know I think two more No, there's two more There's two There's three There's three Always big high, hell, lock I think our separate events There's no more damaging event for the speed There's seven Corruptors and two of production There's still a lowest squad. Maybe it's a lower score Maybe the Terran's by all of his Battlecruisers in his porch Neither of them nor attacking him left That would be the actual dream Oh I don't know I just was drifting up to a better place in my life The good time man, this is the dark time I'm forced to watch this game, so Alright I'm just gonna feed it up to it It happened That of who was chasing Marines by teleporting behind them Marines with finally the defeat the upgrade for coming into play I like that That was some good looking into the future by the Terran Realizing exactly what was going to happen. Now we have lots of scans going down, making sure he knows everything so far Beautiful news Yeah, and he's getting some good gas count as well Oh, rebuilding turrets More Marines here Marines will actually kind of help against the Auto-Turrets, as well If this base goes on, this is gonna be the last mining base Unit lost that 88K against 68K There's bio now There is nothing that really deals with bio except the Banelings, I guess Baneling Infestor does be decent against bio He actually sent me a 50 minute game The first thing I'm gonna do when I get really fun real, is message is this game It feels very similar It also lasts very many It's like prison center. One pick up, no, I don't pick up. There's no more minerals 39 workers here, so I can still long distance mine this or long distance mine this Just ending come on 2K minerals in the bank, just use your Barracks How many Barracks do you have made? Five Seven Seven Barracks, okay? Just produce only Marines The other guy has no money Only Infestors This is. This is insane They actually Like he could just be trading away 10 Lings or 10 Marines, like 5 Lings and that's still be an okay trade because there's like so much money in the bank He's still gonna be able to take this base with one of his 25 Orbital Commands Still defending this Planetary with four Liberators. Nydus! Is he joking? He has 300 minerals left in the bank. It's long distance mining from this base and you decide to spend 20% of your 14 onto a Nydus on a base that is mined out has 35 Missile Turrets and a Planetary Fortress, but he builds another Nydus. Because he might be afraid that the 25 Missile Turrets that are here already wouldn't quite cover it. If anyone is still watching at this point, please, say hi, type something in the YouTube comments, make sure I didn't do this for nothing. There was a reason to all of this, to this endless, absolutely endless sovereign. He has been slow. He can do it. He could be Yamatoing Lings for all I can. Just jimato links and then teleport out Probably still be faster than Oh my god I can't believe he actually sent me a 50 they're actually gonna be able to get the rest Oh, we're not gonna be safe This is it You should leave now the seat if you don't move out I'm gonna Oh my god My life was, don't we find out I'm free to be back there Ha ha Gigi Mom I'm free Alright For a second I was scared I wasn't recording and I had to do this over again The seat I had a loss for words I'm at a loss for words You played so bad this game. I completely forgot about the early game where four Banshees killed every building in your main because you refused to send your queens there. This was, I thought, the dumbest thing I was gonna see today. I couldn't have been more wrong because for the next 54 minutes, you've been showcasing feats I didn't think were possible by humans. I thought we'd evolved too far to showcase a level this low. It was painful. Torture. You made all of us dumber by just watching this. Depression rate skyrocketing worldwide because of this game. You, my sir, are something else. Not just, I can't even leave you there. You have the audacity to complain about balance with the way you played. You should be glad that, I don't even know, you should be happy, just be thankful for the things you have, my friend it must be really difficult living with this low scale I mean it's obvious that you suck but you extremely suck it's not a regular suck I almost feel like just saying you suck isn't quite hard enough and it devalues the meaning of the word suck a bit like other the other people that I said you suck like they sucked you were awful It wasn't just regular sucking This was worse I want you to realize that This was not a regular game This is not what everyday life should be like for you Or for anyone, for that matter. I think we got it over. Don't ever send me a replay again, ever. I will have you on the ban list. Don't use other email accounts. I will figure it out. I will realize after watching for three minutes that it's you. You can't hide. I'm not going to get tricked by you again. You've wasted more time in my life than anyone ever else has. Because not only is this the time watched, but the time that I don't need to process this game is going to be so long. Like years of therapy after watching a game like this. This was insane. Yeah, that's it. If you like this, hit the like button. If you hated it, also hit the like button. If you want to see more of the seeds replays Say so in the comment And perhaps, nah, just kidding I'm never going to watch this again Don't forget subscribe to my YouTube channel. As of a Patreon.

        "text": "Hello everyone, welcome back to a new episode of Is It Imba or Do I Suck? Today we have Mr P in Pants who sent me an email. You might be wondering what did he say? That's a good question. Let's have a look. He said, Hi Harsdom, the title says it all. Marauders are freaking O P A F. Expensive AF Stalkers just tickle them. Expensive AF Colossus just tickle them. Zealots do okay until they micro and get boomed by mines. There is no solution to this as marauders are freaking O P. vs T Please review IMP in Pants versus 4.6k Terran. Now, up into the game, we see he's playing against Fibb, with, of course, the famous creator of the Bronze to Grandmaster series. I'm not sure he's the creator, but he does a lot of them. It's a pretty decent content. Mr P in Pants, just opening up with that standard Nexus before Core. Not quite a standard anymore these days, Core before Nexus is all the hype, but I'm going to forgive him that it's all doable. Now, this wall is pretty terrible. I'll explain exactly why. This wall only is here to block your own units. Reaper can jump up here. If you're chasing him with your Stalker, you're going to need to run all the way around here. He can jump down. You're going to need to run all the way around here So not that great of a wall, honestly If you want a wall on this area, you build a Pylon here, Cybernetics Core over here What would be even better is to build your first Pylon. somewhere over in this area and then build the Gateway right next to it so you can wall this area with a Pylon and a Gateway or you can build a for example a Pylon here then a Gateway over here and a Cybernetics Core here so your Gateway is a little closer to your mineral line that way you wall this part of immediately you only need a Pylon and a three by three building so either a Cybernetics Core or a Gateway will do now we see our boy vibe coming in with his Reaper Here we see how useless this wall really is There's absolutely nothing and oh, you need to run around Amazing And oh, now you're gonna get Oh, jumped on again Guess what, Chief? Kind of warns you for this. That's just amazing, isn't it? I'm so happy that when I say something is bad, and then it immediately in the game shows why it sucks so much It's way better than when I say something and nothing happens with it. happens with it but another thing by the way is the reason why a lot of the time you want to already wall this at the start is that you want to use your second pylon on the low ground to deal with any kind of Hellions now okay we're seeing a factory with a reactor even though this is from a barracks first it can still be Hellions it's actually gonna go Hellions it's a little bit of a weird build order by five but it's okay like some people do play this it's just not very common like the two Hellion follow-up is kind of okay now against this This is why you want the second pylon on the low ground. This is in order to wall this area With then two buildings and the Pylon, you leave a Stalker in the wall and just like that Boom Hellions are pretty much useless You just need a single unit in the wall and you're going to be fine Unless he has like six Hellions, but they can just wall behind it or pull a couple of more units Now we see P&Pants is scouting Oh, there's Hellions There's still, well, I'm not sure what's happening here, but there's still a reactor on this Factory So something seems to be happening. to be happening, probably Hellions, right? So what do you start preparing for for Hellions? Now, the thing I do like is that he starts building Pylons around the map I think the Shield Battery is almost completely useless Usually when people play Hellions, they're going to get enough Hellions to one shot probes or one volley probes with, so at least three Hellions And indeed we see if I get a matter-of-fact, four Hellions, and p m P P m is heading into a third base at some point in the future Now, I have to admit his base is his base His build is pretty bad, honestly. I'm not quite sure what he's been doing, but he should already have a Forge on the way and the same unit count as he has right now So I'm not quite sure what happened there exactly now I think this pylon barely missed this drop Maybe it barely saw it And five goes in with the Medivac There's no units whatsoever in natural I like this weapon There's a well-timed warpin So this drop gets attacked attacked, Hellions going to the main, but I actually think our friend Terran has everything ready. Pull away the probes the moment you see them coming and Okay, well the probe was a little bit slow, but I mean you get forward four Hellions for seven workers still an okayish trade for Terran because the Medivac got away as well now This is the point where where you can say all right now it's time for the probes to have a little fun right four Hellions died and I mean it's still 400 minerals that's a lot of of time on the factory that there wasn't a tank building So this could really indicate that something big is happening here Something might be able, we might be able to get some damage on. So what you want to do is you want to get your, do you still have energy for hallucination? No, I think he just used it. Okay, so you want to kind of sync up this hallucination with your Stalker move out so you can blink into the main base. If you look at what Vipe currently has, he has three Marauders, one Marine, and two Widow Mines. If you would be able to blink seven Stalkers into his main, into his main base. Pretty fat chance. You're just going to be able to win this game, honestly. Forgot the blink micro there as well. When you do this kind of push, you obviously want to be doing individual Stalker blink micro. But yeah, seven Stalkers against three units that were even going to be out of position, he probably would have been able to snipe both the Tech Labs, maybe even go for some SCVs It's hard to say Probably kill a bunch of units as well Somehow Vibe managed to push away these seven Stalkers with just three Marauders I have no clue how that happened You're really not supposed to lose two Stalkers What you're supposed to do is you're probably supposed to kill absolutely everything and keep everything alive But instead, we now lost three Stalkers and only a single Marauder has gone down So not the whole display On top of that, the probe production of Pee and Pants has been a little bit sloppy. The gateways are late, usually against this kind of play. In this case it's pretty fast five Barracks but it started with the three Barracks you want to cut probes at around 48 47 probes built go up to either six or to eight Gateways actually he does have six Gateways okay this is kind of fine then six Gateways is fine I much of the time prefer eight but six is also fine and whenever you open Blink into Charge the natural follow-up is always going to be Templar Archives because when you warp in a lot of Zealots you're going to be floating a lot of gas and in order to stop initial pushes one or two Archons are going to do absolute wonders for your army so always try to get Templar Archives increase the Zealot count increase the Archon count that's really how you want to be playing I don't mind adding in Immortals here and there like sprinkling them in especially if you only have six Gateways I think that's good but you should be careful with the Stalker count four is a good Stalker count some usually what you do is the amount of Stalkers you need initially to defend is the amount of Stalkers you're going to keep for a very long time because you don't want to be spending gas on Stalkers. Now like I said, the Robotics Bay here is not actually that great Much would have preferred Templar Archives, two more Gateways At this point he probably would have had two Archons on the way and a couple of extra Zealots as well Now this fight still is very doable, of course I'm not a big fan of the Stalker I also not like that there's six Sentries That's a little bit too much Sacrifice half of his Zealots straight into the Widow Mines, then decides to use the hallucinations afterward I mean this is not really how you want to engage the Terran whatsoever. Like you want to use force fields to catch small parts of the Terran force and then you jump on top of him So not this small part, but I mean this was already better than what he did before, right? Like you use like two three force fields and you get two three units Like this is completely fine to do Now the Widow Mines have reset again, so actually not the hottest player by P m P. Pee and Pants who had a pretty terrible start of the fight but he still has slightly better economy he is an okayish army if he micro this well he should still be fine but Zealots are stuck behind this army which is not quite how you want to be fighting this the way you want to be fighting this is with the Zealots in front like I said you catch your opponent with force fields and then you micro your Stalkers back individually once they start getting cargo instead what P m P m P P m P P P P P P m P P P P P P P P P. is doing is walking is walking into every single Widow Mine which it's actually kind of difficult to do if your army consists of mostly range units and your Zealots are stuck behind the rest of your army walking into Widow Mines continuously getting shot at is it's probably harder to do them not getting shot at and he will even manage to clean this up because Marauders actually do kind of suck against big Zealot counts so as P m P m p what do you want to do at this point? Well first of all actually you should be getting with Well, with this style maybe plus one is better, but a lot of the time when you're playing charge, plus one armor is actually better. Unless you're playing a very counter-attack-based style, but PvZ is not really playing a counter-attack base style In that case, I much prefer playing armor if you are opening with charge Zealots Now, he's getting Colossus, which I mentioned before isn't that great So then the attack upgrade is kind of normal, but he shouldn't have been doing this, right? But for what he has been doing, I guess the attack upgrade is okay Now, another thing you want to be doing here is you want to be setting up some of that vision around the map So we have a couple of Pylons We lack some vision in the middle We lack some vision on the bottom side We lack some vision over here. This area is rather blind as well And I also wouldn't mind seeing a couple more Probes being sprinkled And 60 workers is rather low Now I understand the main has run out, but Fourth should be on the way already This push out, I'm not completely opposed against Usually you go with three Colossi, but you can perfectly fine, just go with two Colossi, warp in a couple of Archons and try to make a push on your opponent's third base I mean he has good vision of exactly what his opponent is doing, which isn't a whole lot, so he should be able to do that. Now, another kind of rule that you have in PvT is that majority of the time you want to be attacking two areas at the same time So he sent like three zealots around or you attack this area, with your main armies and three zealots in here, send the Warp Prism in the main while you're attacking this part and actually this is good, yeah We do have a Warp Prism in the main I'm very happy with this PvP's You've been doing a good job with the, with the more advanced stuff, but he's been kind of skipping the basics of things like micro and sensible unit compositions, but you can't win them all. Now, if you force field this ramp, you target the command center and just go back home, you're actually going to be in a very good position here I think being PM Pants If you have the the Zealots in the main as well doing damage all you really need to do is go back home and defend at this point but instead we see PM Pants, I'm not very sure what he was attacking down there with the Colossus He's going to keep fighting against Vib's army and it looks like he's going to be losing absolutely everything This is the problem a lot of people have is that they take fights that you absolutely shouldn't be taking right. You just kill the base, you've been doing damage with a drop, you killed some workers, just go home. You achieved your goal. Now it's for him to make a play. You have a Planetary Fortress on the way. You're getting your extra upgrades. Why the hell would you be attacking? Like you're just ahead if you just run back. A lot of the time, you just need to think of what your goal is with a push. And in this case, P M Pencer's goal should have been: I killed a third, or I kill a bunch of workers with a drop or kill a bunch of workers with my main army. But killing his opponent's army wasn't really a realistic goal. So trying to go for that goal, after already achieving a very big goal in killing that third base, was a massive mistake. Something you definitely don't want to do. P and P and P and P M P M Pants. More colossi being built. Still no extra probes. Rich gas not being taken. Obviously a massive error. Rich gas basically is two gas in one and it's, well, you need three less probes as well. Map vision is still okayish, problem with no vision on opponent's army, lacking vision in key area still, this key area, this is probably the most common attack path combined with this, like this Pylon covers this general area, but not this area, so any kind of move out that's going to be heading towards your fourth base, most likely will be missed by P&Pans, which means positioning army will be very close to impossible. Now, Templar in general, is not bad to get. I wouldn't have minded seeing some Disruptors here as well. If you're playing against a mainly ground-based army, Disruptors can be very helpful. But at this point, it might just be very hard for P and P and Pants to get anything down. Like, his work account has been so low His fourth base was so late that he's just very far behind in supply at the moment Like he took a couple of bad fights He's down 3K in units lost And now I believe he might just not have enough He can still, what he can do here is try to zone out his opponent with Templar Well, you can't do that anymore But usually what you do is you split up your Templar and then you storm your opponent's army one by one Or you zone out your opponent while you're trying to get something bigger And with storm, you actually can win a lot of time. Instead, what our boy Pee and Pans did was he got EMPed by absolutely everything and also lost all the energy of his Templars and thus lost the game. So the question here was very simple my friends. The question was, are Marauders freaking OP? I don't know. Maybe Marauders are freaking OP. But if Marauders are freaking OP, this game definitely didn't show it. We've seen fights that my brother, I think at the moment is Platinum. His fights usually are better. Walking Sentries into Widow Mines, walking Zealots into Widow Mines, just basically walking your entire army into Widow Mines. And then going, well, just lost all my army to Widow Mines. Now Marauders can kill me well. Yeah, no crap. Of course Marauders can kill you now. You don't have any units left If you only have Stalkers against Marauders, you're going to have a hard time Like, Marauders are the hard counter to the Stalker Like, that's just how the game works, you know? If his Mines kill all the units that you have that manage, that can actually fight against Marauders, yeah, you're going to lose the game. That's why usually the way you engage is by force-fielding in the Terran army and then fighting, rather than force-filling out the Terran army, So the Terran army is safe from your Zealots, then running your Zealots into the force field wall, tanking for Widow Mines, then not even being able to clear the mines, and then repeating the same move again, 25 seconds later, when the mines have regained their shot That's not quite how engagements work, my friend On top of that, your initial strategy was kind of bad Your build order seemed poor Third base was really late, too many Warp Gates before that A Robotics Facility was relatively late, but it was okay because of what you scouted. What else did we have here? Ah, right. You went to Colossi instead of just going to charge Archon. Map vision was poor. Do I really need to go on the fight at the third? Why would you take that? And if you do take that, please have your Colossus engaged from the start rather than coming in after the fighters have over already. Yeah, honestly, you really didn't do that much right. He did a lot of things wrong. Marauders Imba? No, you suck. Yeah, yeah, you suck. Alright boys. Thanks much for watching. We enjoyed this episode. If you did, don't forget to like this video.

        "text": "Hello everyone, welcome back to a new episode of Is it Imba or do I suck? Today we're going to be have a look at a PvZ game Let me read the email that I got Hello, Kevin, I want to be your next Is it Imba or do I suck? I'm currently a 3.7k MMR Protoss and I'm very aware I do mistakes I do a few F2 and I'm still on my way to completely remove it Today I faced the 3.5k Zerg having a very poor macro The drone count was smaller than his IQ and my probe count That guy kept sending his army, Roach Hydra We're supposed to be at a very close level to you very close level to each other, at least for a macro. I ended up being very pouring gas, so be on charge slots, blah, blah, blah I do think that Roach Hydra is a bit overpowered in that kind of scenario for a race that is supposed to build up a bank and have good macro to constantly remax with a minor micro, unlike Terran and Toss Let me know if I'm at least a bit right or I do suck Well, let's find that out now, shall we? We're going to be following Detective Care But the real detective is us of course Not only me but also the community We look at this game, we have a look. Is there a lot of big mistakes or is perhaps the Zerg race indeed just too good? It is possible Now MMRs between 3500 and 3700 Protoss 3700 MMR and the Zerg 3500 I'm not sure what league that is, maybe Platinum or something I don't know. somewhere around there I guess somewhere between gold and diamond one of the three now we have actually a standard opening here for Detective Kerr who is playing a proper one-gate expand you know the the Cybernetics Core on time the gases on time the Pylon and everything on time the other hand we have uh ILU I assume at least the first one is a capital i ILU is playing just a standard Hatchery first into speed should be taking a third base soon with this drone So yeah, the game actually looks good Looks like these guys so far know what they're doing. Stargate opener here for Detective Kerr as well I'm a happy man. Whenever I get these kind of replays, I'm always afraid we're going to have like a 5 Gate opener or something and then losing. But now this is a proper game, you know. We can actually get to the bottom of this this. Me and Detective Kerr and the rest of you guys watching. So you see four Lings being sent across the map. Now in this kind of case you kind of want to cancel the Adept so you can keep chasing these Lings and you just kind of want to kite them in a way, right? So you shoot once you run away you shoot once you run away and then very easily you'll be able to kill four Lings and the Zerg also wouldn't have minded as he tried to attack the Adept which definitely is a mistake So there's no real scout now because of this. Detective Kerr doesn't know if there's a third base instead we'll be sending this Adept back across the map not a massive fan of it but usually what you do is if you can't get any info then you know you kind of accept it but sending an Adept across the map at this time means that if he gets a lot of Lings and his speed finishes you're just gonna be losing your Adept for free and that's something none of us of course want that's exactly what's gonna happen now like you hardly get any information here and most of the time he lost the Adept at least that's the most important thing yeah that's the you know the punchline of this story basically is that don't do that after three minutes you don't want to be moving out on the map anymore with any kind of this is bad so Stasis Wards cost 50 energy and can be triggered by a single Ling it's just better like and they don't even kill them it just delays your problems So that's why you always defensively, you always want to be using your stasis, no not Stasis Ward, your pulsar beam, better than Stasis Ward, it's just not good. You're also not putting on any pressure to your opponent if you put a stasis ward at home Like all of these mineral lines are completely empty Actually, Mothership Core did a good job keeping its oracle a secret and there's almost no anti-air There's three queens, now a fourth queen. So if you would have gone to the other side of the map, he probably would have been able to kill a lot of workers but the Stasis Ward at home actually gives away that there is Oracles and if this Zerg was a little bit competent. He would now be building Drones instead we see a Lair and a Roach Warren. So he's going into Forge Robo for its Twilight Council now in this matchup what you need to do is you need to actually get a third base at some point for a lot of or for some lower level this might come as a surprise, but you can't actually two base all the way Or you can try it. It doesn't work quite as well. So what you want to do is once you get two Gateways and a Robotics Facility, then you get the third base and then you add the Forge and the Twilight Council. You don't first get the Forge and Twilight Council, the Gateways, the Immortal, like all of this just the leisure you're gonna be by so much. Like you could be killing five, seven workers as well at this way more. There's only a single Queen here. Like we have seen absolutely no Oracle control. Like Detective Curris practically sleeping at this point with his Oracles. Now he comes in and all you need to do is you right-click the Drone and then you move forward. You right-click the Drone and you move forward. I actually think he would have been able, if he migrated this semi-well to get at least eight to nine workers. With a single or a single Oracle usually you can get six if there's only a single queen in Spore or five. Six is pushing it a bit. Now I also like to make everyone aware that Detective Kerr has done zero scouting whatsoever. Just now he got aware that there is a third base. He doesn't know if there's a third base. He doesn't know if there's a Lair, doesn't know if there's extra gases, doesn't know if there's roaches on the way. Now he's building more immortals, which is nice. His opponent has no workers, which is also good, but it always helps to know what your opponent is doing, of course. This is absolutely not going to be working. This roach push Detective Kerr once again is, I'm not quite sure what he's doing. Like, he should be either using the Oracles to defend or using the Oracles aggressively, but he's not really doing anything right now with them. Not scouting, he's not doing any damage, just staying out. Now this push is gonna do absolutely nothing. It's just not a big push. You know, it's too little roaches. There's too many Immortals. Pretty decent micro here by Detective Kerr. And here come the Oracles now. At this point he's up 11 workers. Another problem is though that he has no clue that he's up 11 workers. Like what you want to be doing is you want to be scouting your opponent. You want to be counting gases. That's one of my many hobbies. It's just counting gases of the Zerg player and going, alright, he's on four gas. Probably means he doesn't have enough drones because Imba Zerg has enough drones and enough income. Usually they're going to go up to six gas, they want to get a fourth base as soon as possible. So the moment you've been counting these gases and you see, hey, wait a second, there's only four gases. Probably means he is doing something aggressive to me. You want to get a lot of units out. You want to add Gateways Right now, Detector is flowing 1100 minerals These roaches somehow managed to get in here I'm not sure why there's only two immortal He's floating 1,400 minerals He has 4 Gates available Like he could also throw down like a Photon Cannon and a Shield Battery, you know? Like if you have 1800 minerals, you can literally do anything that you want Decides to not chase with the rest of the army It's a very strange game, honestly One guy doesn't build any Drones The other one just doesn't build anything in general Two Oracles are still alive A bit out of energy, it makes sense Now the moment you have a lot of money, there's two things you can do. You can pretend that you don't have a lot of money, or you can make a plan to start spending it The majority of the time I'd say it's better to actually start spending it So at four or five gateways And people always say, well, I see professional players, you know, they only use like six gateways at this point It's cool, but if you were a professional player, you wouldn't be floating 3K resources at the 8 minute mark Like if you're floating 3K resources, perhaps, you know, copying the start of professional players, but the rest just add more gateways, you know? If you don't have macro, then you just add more gateways. I mean, it's a little late, nine minutes in, I think six gateways, but better late than never is what I always say. So actually, Kerr is, you know, except for the bad macro, losing the Immortals in a weird way and no static defense for a very long time on his third. He's not doing that bad of a job. He's also not really scouting. So in his mind, his opponent is still on a single gas. And only on Roaches. No clue that there is double evo either, even though by clicking on the units, he would be able to figure that out. Now, the way you want to play as Protoss in general is you want to get Immortals, you want to get Storm. And you want to get Archons as well But especially against Roach Hydra, Immortal Storm, It's absolutely beautiful Archons aren't as beautiful, but still a little bit beautiful So you can build them as well But majority of the time, Storm Immortals is what's going to win you the game Now, we see what happens as a Protoss when you have zero map vision whatsoever, and you keep your complete army in a ball You have no clue when your opponent's going to attack you I mean, this army is absolutely tiny, right? It's what? 16 roaches and five Hydras Now, there's five immortals, and there's a bunch of sentries Like, that's definitely going to be enough. The problem is, look at this, Detective Kerr last saw him here and he moves over here. Now, he's like, well, I hope he's going to come over here because I have absolutely zero vision. Does spot his opponent's army And also sees that there's Tunneling Claws. Don't forget, you can see when Tunneling Claws has been researched by the claws popping up on the back. Now, Detective Kerr sees his opponent's army move to the bottom side, and he's like, this sounds like the perfect time to move on the map Of course, no knowledge whatsoever of the position he is in because the last time he scouted his opponent was at the two minute mark It's like literally anything could be happening right now. His opponent could have 85 workers, hive on the way, greater spire basically done, you know? This could be an actual realistic scenario. Another scenario is that his opponent has 63 workers and is practically all in. If you know your opponent is practically all in, all you need to do is defend. You just built like 12 stasis wards here. You sit, you sit and you do absolutely nothing like if there's no Hive and your opponent is on roach hydra and you have Archon immortal storm why the hell would you move out all you need to do is sit on your pretty butt and make sure that nothing happens you know just kill the game basically until you see him start tacking into something else or until you hit max supply with plus two or three upgrades and can be like okay now it's time for me to attack instead he moves out roach counter attack actually doesn't do that much damage So once again this is honestly looks pretty good His opponent is now going for Hive Now of course our friend Detective Kerr is completely unaware of that. We haven't seen any pressure from him, not a single Zealot run by No Prism in the main There hasn't been any defense in the main There hasn't been any defense at the third base Really the only map vision he gets is if he accidentally builds two Pylons too far forward Or if he a moves across the map with F2 Now how do I know it's F2? It's because the Oracles are in the group as well Oh no, it's not F2 There's a unit in the wall Maybe he just warped it in We'll see how long this bad boy will remain So it means he just has everything in one control group. This is going to be a hell of a lot of fun to control Now, this fight should be the absolute easiest fight in the world He has storm Immortal Archon against Roach Hydra I actually think if he would have aimed at that engagement, he would have just straight up won that fight Now I'm not super sure anymore because he lost a little bit of supply. Once again floating 4K minerals though. So it adds five gateways I don't actually mind him adding extra gateways I think that isn't even bad Like, no people always make fun, oh, you have so much money Could you be using your actual gateways But if you're bad at macro, adding gateways isn't that bad. Like it's a completely fine thing to do. Now, here we go. Once again, Detective Kerr with the ultimate blindman plays. This doesn't scout whatsoever, moves forward on the map. No spells are being used, no force fields. There are no storms available currently so that can't be used. No force field is really painful against Roach Hydra obviously, because Roach Hydra is an army that can't do much against force field. If there was Ravagers or Banelings, you know, Banelings usually still be able to slip through, but Roach and Hydras, if you just cast three force fields, like you split the army, not even in half or in a third, just anything really. You're just going to be able to kind of win. Now 3-3 is on the way for Ilu, plus 3 is already 3 done for Detective Kerr who isn't continuing upgrades I mean he has a nice army He does have a couple of storms right now One storm, two storm These are fine storms and Ilu will need to go back home A couple of Carriers or a couple of Stargates are being built right now Probably will need the gases here saturated Another thing you can do by the way is just adding more Photon Cannons and Shield Batteries if you're floating a lot of minerals I don't understand The one thing I don't understand is this How it's possible to play in a way where you actually have zero information Like, this has to be so scary. Like, this is the kind of guy that complains about Mutalisks as well I was just walking, you know, playing Starcraft, and my opponent Roach Hydras, and then all of a sudden, 35 Mutas showed up And I had no clue Like, I had a cannon at one of my bases, but yeah, I just wasn't ready for But yeah, well, like maybe a scout every now and then, you know, just even harassment is fine because harassment also scouts Now this fight on Creep with no reinforcements with only two storms in your army was, I actually think this fight was more difficult to lose than to win. I could simulate like a hundred different scenarios and I think there would be maybe four scenarios where you lose and two of those scenarios are you move commanding into the opponent one of the scenarios is accidentally attacking all of your own High Templar before the fight starts and the fourth scenario is what Detective Kerr just did over here I absolutely no clue how it's possible to fight in such a way where you make Immortals look weak against Roaches That takes a very special kind of skill which Detective Kerr seems to have in abundance Because fight after fight, he just manages to absolutely get the worst out of his units. Like, his army has honestly been looking good, even though his macro sucks, he has no clue what his opponent is doing. Like, I actually feel like just A-moving a lot of the time would just be better than what he's doing. He's doing the negative micro, which is where you do an action of controlling your units. And it turns out worse than what it would have been if you would have just done nothing. You know, just having his army on hold position, I think majority of the time would just be better than the stuff he's doing. Like any of the commands, the stop command, the A move command, or the hold position command would be better than what he's been doing, which I still am not quite sure what we're seeing here. Now, this game, you could be like, well, he's lost like every single fight he's ever fought. How is he still in the game, Detective Curry? Yeah, that's a good question. Because his opponent is on 60 workers. He's just maxing Roach Hydra with sick upgrades. I gotta give deserve this 3-3. All you need to do is Protoss player, just wait till you're maxed. Get storming Oracles, you can have Carriers all you want, but you probably are going to need upgrades on your Carriers. Like this is a mistake people make as well They'll be like, ah, Carrier is a tier three unit, Roach is a tier one unit So Carriers kill Roach as fast, right? That's how it's supposed to work No, you have zero upgrades on your Carriers And the other guy has three armor upgrades Like, Carriers are going to do like two damage per shot on the Roach Like, the majority of your damage needs to come from Immortals and your and your Storms I can't believe he's actually losing to Ultras without any melee upgrade This I'm actually a bit upset, like, the thoughts by Detective Kerr here weren't too bad, you know? Like, honestly, like the army composition, the countering, the Well, that's it, basically. The early game was nice, you know? He did a good job there, he built the buildings. He built the buildings mainly his buildings, not when he's floating a bit, but you know, he built buildings in almost the correct order. Majority of the time At least sort of, okay, let me put it. The first three and a half minutes were almost flawless, if you don't count for getting to build a Supply Depot. So, the problem was just really the point from three and a half minutes on to the end of the game is where. Everything he did made very little sense, happened very slowly, and completely blind. Look, this is what I mean. Like Carriers don't do a lot of damage to Terran. How can you handle that as Protoss? No Why would you complain in the game? I don't know. No Zerg bank is remax your opponent. It was broke. He had 57 workers. Yeah, this guy actually won because of upgrades. Look, look at the units lost. You had a way bigger bank. He might way more. He lost 15K more in an 18 minute game. Upgrades aren't the issue. Now the carriers with plus zero against the plus three armor hydras. Upgrades weren't the issue. In one way detective cour is right. Like upgrades weren't the issue. It was just one of the many issues in this game, but it wasn't the issue, you know, like actually getting the issue in this game is impossible because there were so many mistakes. Now. The question was, is Roach Hydra remax Imba? I have no clue because we haven't seen Roach Hydra Remax. This guy never remaxed. He was on 57 workers majority of the game. He had zero eco. You mind like 20K more, maybe 30K more this game. You spend it all, you lost it. Your army control was so bad. You didn't use a single force field, guardian shield was never used. You almost never used storms. Your Immortals were always at the front of an engagement, which by default they moved to the back So you must have microed them to the front somehow I'm not even sure how this is possible The way you took engagement just hurts my soul. Your scouting was absolutely awful You actually didn't even know if he had a Lair The only reason you knew he had a Lair was because you saw Hydras The only reason you knew he had a hive was because you saw Ultras It's like that's not how you scout what your opponent is doing Like you want to anticipate what their units are going to be You don't want to be like, oh, Hydras, oh, that's nice. No, you see the Lair, you see the hydra, it's like, oh, it's Hydralisk, how many Drones is this? How many Gases does he have? Like many questions that you can answer by checking his base But no, you F2, or I don't think you F2 You just put every, this is the worst part If you F2, it's kind of like, okay, you know, F2s Like, I can see why everything is in one control group Would you make the conscious decision of putting your Oracle and your Phoenix in the same control group as your Templar and your sentry? Like, what do you want me to say to this? Yeah, Roach Hydra is very broken No, my friend, Roach is not very broken Your micro sucked. Your first three minutes were fantastic. I've tried to put in a compliment every now and again. People are saying I've been mean, but first three minutes, yeah, we're good. That's nice. After that, scouting sucked, fighting sucked, macro was absolutely atrocious. Map vision? You didn't have any, so I can't even comment on it. If this was one of those forms, I would have to write not applicable. You just didn't have map vision. Roach Hydra, 3-3 upgrades. I believe it can be difficult to deal with. If there's lots of multi-tasking going on, we have a Zerg with 80, 85 workers, it can be difficult. Guy was on 16 workers. He didn't once multi-task or run-by. He did straight up engagements. This is absolutely the worst style that there is by Zirk. And you just, you just sucked. You just sucked. You did nothing correct. You were a bad, bad player. Now don't send me no more emails. All right. Thanks everyone for watching. I hope you did enjoy this episode. If you did, don't forget to subscribe to this channel. Does help me a lot. Some of my other Is it Imba or do I suck if you liked it. I had a sick video yesterday where I hallucinate my entire army, well, not my entire army, big part of my army, beating grandmasters with stupid stuff, I think the series is called. So I'll link that in some here as well at the end. So you can have a look at that I thought it was cool. Thanks everyone for watching. I see you all next time for a new episode of whatever day it is. Bye-bye."

        "text": "What's up guys, welcome back to a new episode of Is it Imba or do I suck Today we have a replay It's sent to me by the Great Bolt Let's have a look at it Hello, Harsom, I'm a friend from China We all enjoy your I owe this series so much Here I want to share you a replay, where I had lost to a Protoss on Korean server I was in a good position through all the game I got better economy, larger army, and higher level in weapons/armor upgrades before the final battle But still I lost the game I thought I have done everything I could and got defensive feed it just because Toss is Imba. Could you please look into the replay and decide whether it is Protoss to Imba or I suck? Regards 4 7k on the Korean server That's very close to GM I think that's Masters 2 maybe So we're getting some high-level players from the Chinese community, the Great Bolt, who wasn't so sure, you know A lot of the time we get people that are very sure that the opponent is Imba, but Great Bolt was more It was a question It felt like I'd done everything, but maybe I'm missing something So he isn't quite sure about himself He's lacking some confidence in its claims, which No, I don't like I like when people have confidence in their claims. The more confidence they have in their claims, the nicer it is to shut them down But let's have a look to see if Great Ball is actually that's great, or if he's just a bit bald He starts with an SCV scout Always nice at any level, of course, making sure your opponent is doing what your opponent should be doing And what does he see? He sees a nexus before a core And he sees a wall that I don't think this is actually a wall I've seen some walls in my time, but I'm pretty sure the Reaper can just jump up here The Reaper might even be able to jump up here and just walk through here This is an absolutely terrible wall. I hope Grubby realizes that opening just looking standard. Solid standard, nothing wrong with it. He starts his SCV, gets his Reaper, his Marine, plays Barracks before gas. Yes, absolutely fantastic, Grubby. So far this is indeed the perfect game. And we might be looking at an imbalanced replay, my friends. We might just be, this might be the first one. So far, people keep asking me in the comments, hey, has there any time been anything imbalanced? Yes, in the third episode, I got sent a replay by Nimzovik. Nimzovik thought that Protoss air was imbalanced. But when we watched the replay, we actually realized not only the Nimzovik sucked, but also the unit composition that he was playing was imbalanced. So he was playing Swarm Host Nydus So not only was his unit composition in balance, he also sucked So we pulled a quick reverse on him So that happened one time Now we're going to see if today is going to be the second time, and hopefully without the reverse, maybe Protoss is actually too powerful Now we're seeing a Factory being built on the other side and it's getting very close to this Barracks, so I think he might swap them. I'm not a massive fan of this build for the simple reason that it's going to hit really late, right? If you play Hellion builds, most of the time I prefer playing them either from a gas first or playing them from a Barracks before gas with a Marine because then your Hellions finish at like the three minute mark. Right now they're going to finish at 327, 328. Well, they should finish a bit faster, so I think you mess something up, but they're going to be finishing rather late, and your whole push is going to be very delayed. You see, the opponent is building a wall, which is doing a good job at that. Well, this is this third gas. Why is this so early? This smells a bit like mech to me, which is, it's possible We've seen TiWi do it a couple of times. It's just not as popular Okay, we're going to be going into Cloak Banshee Now, keep a look at this gas. A hundred gas has been mined so far Let's see when this gas actually becomes useful. It's always important to see in your build order, like, hey, did I actually need to take a gas that already? Or would it have been better of spending the minerals somewhere else? Now, moving across the map with four Hellions and a Reaper, the trick you can do is you bounce the adepts out of the wall with your Reaper, and then you run by. Just throw a grenade, they move out of the way, and there you go. The Protoss opponent is building a robotics facility and Phoenixes, so we'll be able to most likely pick up all of these Hellions. So Hellions completely useless at this point. We see our Terran player floating 400 gas. 200 gas comes out of this one. He still hasn't dipped below the amount of gas that was mined from this refinery. So so far it hasn't been useful. All he's following up with an Engineering Bay. Keeps his Banshee at home and gets a Cyclone. It's a very old early game. His build order of the Terran seems extremely bad honestly. Okay here we go now we're going into Mech. The Engineering Bay was I guess just for turrets so he must have spotted that there is a Stargate here. Observer making its way across the map. Banshees should move across the map. Like usually what you do with Banshees in PvT is you send them in the moment you have cloak. You don't actually wait for two. I think that's usually bad and a mistake. Like the real power of Banshees: send in one over here. And then once that one is fighting already, the second one comes in over here, you know? Because if Protoss has detection, like if they're ready, they're ready for it most of the time. They're going to be ready for one. They're going to be ready for two. So actually waiting for two is something you do against Zerg. That's something you do against... What is he doing? Double Engineering Bay before extra Barracks? Okay. All right, all right. Let me just pass this real fast here. Let's just have a look at this situation. So he builds two E-Bays before the extra Barracks, meaning his stim and combat shield is going to be extremely delayed On top of that he's getting Mag-Field Accelerator, which is an upgrade you get when you're doing Mech, or a very dedicated push on to the third Sometimes you can still follow up into Bio, and most of the time this indicates you're going into Mech Then he builds three Banshees, which also makes no sense It makes sense with this because it's Barracks are so late they might as well build a third Banshee, with two Banshee, then you usually swap with the Barracks Third Command Center I like, but the two E-Bay before Barracks is insanely greedy. This build, the only reason, if he's going to get ahead after this, is because he was extremely greedy Like, it's not normal to play like this You should not normalize this kind of behavior Now, he's going to be able to get some damage in with these Banshees, which is a big deal, actually Observer gets recalled I see extra observers being built Now, good start for the Terran, honestly Good start for the Terran, except he's floating, well, he was floating 700 minerals He decided to add a couple of extra barracks I had a couple of extra barracks This is the Six rax is not a thing, right? It's going to be five rax, and then seven rax after. Six Barracks, he is building because he, you know, he forgot the macro for a bit. In general, he's been forgetting to macro a fair amount. We've seen him flowed a lot of money all the time. There's only one guy in gas here. Third gas has been absolutely useless, by the way. That could have been taken way later. Like, together with the extra gases, would have given you more minerals and does faster production. The harass going back into the same area, you know for sure there's going to be an Observer here. I'm not a big fan of it. It is going to work out, but that is more because of the Protoss incompetence than because of the Terran during harassment. Actually it does got a lot of damage It's going to be so far ahead now because this 1-1 is done already His opponent doesn't have a single upgrade, so I'm not saying this game is over, but if both of these players were of equal skill level, then yeah, this game should be pretty over The Cyclones are going to be doing absolutely nothing in this unit composition, so just wasted like 450 or something like 800, 900 resources, including the Mag-field Accelerator on these two Cyclones that actually won't contribute whatsoever to this army composition But I don't mind getting a Cyclone or two if you know you're playing against air, but the way that the great bolt went about it, I'm gonna be real. I am not actually a fan I don't, I don't think it's good Now, we see no Missile Turrets yet, one Missile Turret here, no Missile Turret on the third base, so it's gonna be losing, absolutely nothing, which is nice The Proz also has some interesting ideas about Micro, but he didn't send in the replay, so we'll let him go I'm actually surprised that the Terran is going to be losing this game in the end, because, I have no clue how that's gonna happen His 2-2 is starting before the first Forge of his opponent is even done There's two Factories on the way What? Ghost Academy, 6 Barracks, two Factories Not producing out of 3 of the Barracks, 4 of the Barracks are not producing. This factory isn't producing. You don't actually need more production structures, my friend. What you need is to use them. Ghost Academy. I mean, I'm extremely confused as to what's happening. The proper way to play here for the Terran would be to just get Vikings from two Starports, five Barracks, then do a push with 2-2, plus one air, like 10 Vikings and maybe 3 Ghosts. You're gonna be maxed when you hit 2-2 if you do it properly. Off of 5-rax double Starport, you're gonna absolutely destroy your opponent. Like it's not even gonna be close. If you did the same amount of harass, the same amount of damage as he did in this game, imagine hitting at 2-2 with just 10, 12 Vikings and a maxed army against a guy that's 0-0 or maybe, perhaps he has 1-1 But you get three Ghosts, you get 12 Vikings, you just kind of destroy him You go just walk over him Protoss is getting four Robotics Facilities in total Protoss also isn't really playing the same game as I am Fourth base is a little late, slight oversaturation on this third, but I mean he's macroing well at this point To be fair, absolutely nothing is happening He literally has zero map vision I doubt he even knows what his opponent's army composition is. Doesn't know there's extra gases yet. All he knows is that there's a couple of Adepts on the map. There's not a single Marine on the map. No Sensor Towers, no map vision, no harassment, no attacks. Even though he's been ahead all game long already, look at the timing. A 2-2 timing is here right now. See 2-2. But he's not going to take it instead. Just waits at home. Just chilling about. We have six Medivacs. We have nothing to deal with Colossus really. 41 Marines. Now, I think that this army, if they would be clashing right now, would still be able to win, just purely because he has so much money. And he has Ghost or so much money, so many units and so many Ghosts, and he's still up to two upgrades. Like, he's going to need to seriously botch a fight here, I think, in order to, for this game to get even slightly close. Let's have also a look at how he controls army. We see everything is in the same control group. So Ghost, Siege Tanks, everything basically is absolutely the same control group. So decent start of the fight. Now, you want to keep fighting near your Siege Tanks, most. most of the time and split your Marines a little push them more into a line but yet usually you want to just siege up your Tanks and then keep fighting near your Tanks while still producing stuff we see some big floating going on right now and not a massive fan of continuing to fight at this point there's one Tank still in the back I think the initial fight on the ramp wasn't too bad, but then afterwards you should keep getting your Tanks there with your main arms Because honestly if you're just fighting Marines and six Marauders, even against just two Colossi, you're going to be having such a difficult time killing your opponent. If you don't have any EMPs, you don't have any anti-air, like Marines just die Colossi are the hard counter to Marines, then there's a bunch of Immortals This is actually a really saturated guy Let's also note 3-3 hasn't continued building, so it was actually going to be a 2-2-2, but just a pure 2-2-2-2, nothing else behind it Now, if you're fighting against just pure Stalker Immortal, you can pull the SCVs Basically the moment, you realize there's no more Zealots around, because SCVs actually tank a lot of damage from both Stalkers and Immortals, so you can actually survive it. If you pull SCVs from both bases, you let the MULEs do the mining for a bit, I actually think he would have been able to still hold on here Now it's going to be a little bit harder, right? This opponent has a Warp Prism here His two-two upgrades are done, so somehow the Protoss went from being down four upgrades to being even in the, basically within four minutes I think the Terran might still be able to stabilize here If he does this well, it's still a possibility, honestly There is four Colossi on the way, though, so it might be a little bit of an issue And now the triple Siege Tank action might actually come a little bit in handy. I love that his reaction to losing 25 workers in the past 45 seconds is throwing down two more Barracks The thing that he really needs at the moment is extra production The thing you really need right now is to be producing from all of your structures at all time If you don't need more production, you just need to be used to be used to be used to be used to be used to make be using your production more Siege Tanks on the way, okay Another big micro error is fighting the Colossi while your Siege Tanks aren't sieged yet and not shooting So the way you want to do it is you just run back with your bio, so you kind of just kite back. So you get chased Imba? Oh no. Great vault Imagine playing a tank-based style and fighting without your tanks Every single fight, just consistently consistently forgets to GG as well Great vault, great vault, great vault Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, great vault All right. Great vault Let me talk to you, my friend Imba you said You weren't sure if it was Imba or not, but your words in the game Don't leave a lot to the imagination Let's put it like this The early game was fantastic even though your build sucked The way you executed was terrible Your third gas was too early Hellions didn't do anything. Your Banshees kind of got damage sheerly by luck, not so much, because you controlled them in such an amazing way Double eBay, before extra barracks, triple gas, Mag-Field Accelerator I don't think so, my friend That's not the way you're supposed to play As a follow-up, you were up like literally 40 supply four upgrades You decided to do absolutely nothing with your advantage, not a single drop Even though you were doing nothing on the map, you were consistently floating somewhere between 600 and 1,000 minerals Your production was way too big for how much money you were making, and still you managed to float your composition. You can play three tank stuff, but the important thing is this is a very odd concept, and I want you to pay very close attention here, is that if you make an army that consists of tanks, it's really important that you also fight within the range of these tanks. Now, I understand this might be a little difficult for you to grasp, but imagine it like this. Imagine you have some pain in your knees, right? So paining your knees And you go to a shop to buy better shoes, and you test new shoes, and you know, a long time of research into the shoes And after, you know, three, four hours, you find a perfect pair of shoes You take those shoes home. And then for your next run, you just use your old shoes again That's what you're doing You're building a tank army and you're not using them Like, why build the tanks then? Just, if you only want to use bio units, just get bio units Probably would have been better this game Just go Ghost Viking, Marine, Marauder That's completely fine But you wanted to get tanks You wanted to get fancy At least, the least you can do is fight in tank range. You get that great ball. Just just write it down. Right down in your little notebook. Good advice is by harsh them right it down under. Don't take a third gas before I build extra Barracks. Don't get double Engineering Bay. Don't get Mag-Field Accelerator. Three Banshees? I don't think so my friend. We'll stick to the two. So overall honestly you didn't play too poor you know you well well actually the only thing you really did was you killed a lot of work with the Banshees that's really what got this game so far I had Wait, what the hell? I'm seeing something that I completely missed during the game. You forgot Combat Shield. No wonder your fights were going so poor as well. All right, mate, you're out You suck You suck a massive amount I suck a little for missing that you didn't have Combat Shield But you really suck I can't really dare to complain about this game without having Combat Shield for 14 minutes, forgetting 3-3 The worst bill order opener in the world's most terrible micro and not fighting in tank range get out of here all right see you always next time thank you very much for sending in the replay great boat this gave me great pleasure and uh see tomorrow for a new youtube place bye bye."

        "text": "Hello friends, welcome back to a new episode of Is it Imba or do I Suck? Today we're going to be having a look at a Chinese replay, which was sent to me by a fan from China Zerg player in the Chinese server with 4.3K MMR There was a game I played with a Terran who used mech I was playing two-based Muta build and kept leading in supply and economy and almost end the game as my Broodlord kill his natural But then he just defended all of my army with Thor and pushed me back I found it so hard for Zerg to deal with those giant transformers in the late game. Thor is just a unit that need no micro or maybe it just too impact Thanks Fans from China So not a very wild claim here Just a pretty mild claim Thors are too strong, not even just mech in general, just the Thor He seems to be doing fine in the mid and the late game Just the moment there's too many Thors, they don't require any micro We're going to be having a look here indeed, my Chinese friend Let's have a look if the Thor is indeed in the mid-game if the Thor is indeed Imba Or if perhaps something else is going on here We just have a pretty standard opener out of the Terran I think it was a gas first. Rieper seems a little bit late Engineering Bay block or bunker block on the third base. On this base in theory you can take this base but it's not that good so I'd not really suggest it. You have speed on the way here. Yeah, seems pretty interesting to me actually. Just a pretty standard game, nothing weird going on yet. This is pretty much how usually CVT is being played. If your third gets blocked, a lot of the time you see Zerg actually playing for that two-based Mutalisk style. So they can, once their speed finishes and they get like one or two queens out, they can deny the bunker. But they don't have a third base during that time, so might as well, you know, keep mining gas a little bit and go straight into fast Lair and then followed up by Mutalisk And I guess as we're going to be seeing here, out of our Zerg Meanwhile, the Terran is just hopping into, what is this? So he swapped, he built a Tech Lab with the Factory, then he moved the Barracks away to build the Reactor and is building single Hellions from the Factory It's an interesting build I haven't seen much of that Lair starts straight away, slight oversaturation in the main base but nothing too bad Three Queens moving to the front There's one Queen in the main as well. So four Queens total so far. Wouldn't mind seeing some extra gases going down at this point. At least one of them as a new round of drones should start happening. All right, three gases. Perhaps pushing it a bit, but that's fine. Third base could be going down, is going down. So a pretty solid build opener here for our Zerg player who is happily spreading creep as well. So far there's nothing to complain about, honestly. No Thors have entered the field yet either, so it's looking solid so far, I have to admit. As the Lair is close to getting finished up, we will see the Spire start very soon. First Banshee is out, and cloak is about halfway down. Second Banshee on the way as well Now these Hellions shouldn't be able to do too much Usually you push the Hellions away with your Queens rather than with the lings It's usually the way too well He's doing actually a pretty decent chopper trading It's like 10 lings or I guess what was a Hellion or maybe a Reaper? A Reaper and a cancelled building I guess Third Command Center on the way as the two-based Spire kind of starts up First Banshee's out. Now do we have any kind of scouting information? No we have zero scouting information so for no Overseer being used on the other side no Overseer being used at home usually the timing for blind spores is 4:30 I assume if you're getting an Overseer uh blindly you need to get it around 4:40ish something like that or 4:45 just to be in in time for cloak Banshee you know it's going to be a little bit late it's going to lose some workers that's the first true mistake really not getting any scouting info Overseer being late could have had it earlier Spire's already pretty far done so that's the timing he already had a Lair He will need to pull away his Drone. Second Banshee arrives on the third base as well. So a couple of more drones will be going down here. Not quite the way you want to open. Fusion Core is a follow up for the Terran together with an Armory. So it seems to be going into Battlecruiser Mech, if you ask me. This Banshee is also getting a couple of kills. Let's show how many workers. There's a four workers still in total. A couple of extra Lings going down. This Queen might fall There's no detection current over here Overseers on the way so one Raven does end up falling lots of Lings going down as well so good job here by the Terran managing to really keep the Zerg behind you see Zerg hasn't been doing a great job so far as he's down 10 workers he doesn't have any Mutalisks on the way yet defense of the Banshees has been pretty soft I have to admit now we finally have some Mutalisks on the way but it took his time so the early game is really really bad here for Zerg um You're just really well. I mean, being down 13 workers, he does have seven Mutalisks on the way, but that's no way to live life, you know? As a Zerg player, you want to be usually ahead in workers, but if you're not even, then you might as well just leave the game most of the time. So we have a Mech Terran here indeed who will be going into a second Armory as well. We have continued Mutalisk production from a Chinese Zerg player who cleans up what I can only assume to be the final Banshee. First Battlecruiser has now arrived and our Terran should be aware that there is indeed Mutalisks. Mutalisks are being sent around for some kind of harassment. There's no turret yet. There's a lot of freaking MULEs though MULEs and scans absolutely in abundance if he wants to Two Widow Mines are burrowing Turret will finish. So, still a very bad situation here for the Zerg, right? down 14 15 workers gets a couple of workers but not quite what you want he really needed a little more than just this now the Battlecruiser shows up and will push away this Mutalisk we have turrets everywhere we have MULEs we see the income is heavily in favor of the Terran no fourth base yet for the Zerg only now getting 11 more drones just have nine more larvae so it means he was saving larvae up for a while already it's funny because Zerg actually has like the are difficult but then you have the easiest spending mechanic right you you can just hold down a button and it automatically produces units so he has been failing a little bit with that but once again he has nine larvae floating for no real reason still no fourth base on the way as well good Ling run by coming in though and there's not a lot of cars you have to defend transform into the Hellbats the main Lings will try to get something done but Battlecruiser will shut that down as well Mutas looking for openings left right and center might not be able to find them as there's still two Widow Mines here. Good target fighter on this step level I'm not sure he's aware of the Widow Mines We're just getting lucky that he didn't fly any further in Here's the first Thor We'll be able, actually won't be able to scare this up So it's going to be taking quite a beating As after all of this, after all of this fighting, 19 workers have gone down or have been killed by our Zerg player, but he's still on even workers We still just have Lings and Mutas flying across the map and running across the map trying to get some damage done Really not thinking about the future as well Third base is late Creep spread has been advancing slowly but surely. We get a fourth and a fifth at the same time I don't mind because they are so late but this fort should have been done a long time ago already Our Zerg player should be on 76, 80 workers at this point and then taking a fifth base trying to get into that 88, 89 worker count really where you can start throwing Banelings into your opponent consistently Third Hatchery, wow, he's going to be saving a lot of Larva Even now he already has 12 Larva having some trouble spending his money I guess, otherwise the triple Hatchery doesn't make a lot of sense He does have a good map vision He's doing a pretty decent job almost. seven more workers on the way so now really trying to even up that work account you can see mineral income still behind by almost 2,000 there's a lot of MULEs on the map there's a bunch of Battlecruisers out already together with the Thor should definitely be able to deal with all of those Mutalisks and whoops bunch of Mutas do end up falling so far five Mutas have gone down units lost is still in favor of the Terran and so is the eco so there looking spicy 16 more drones are on the way Do we have any upgrades? We have plus one so far for the Mutas, no plus two on the way. Even though he does have 60 Mutalisk already, we're not seeing any advanced tech, we're not seeing an infestation pit, here we go It's taking his time though The transitions, the drone build up, everything is a little bit too slow so far And even though it feels for the Zerg like he's been doing a lot of damage, you know, killed a lot of workers The trades actually have been relatively easy, even Actually, there's more units lost here for the Zerg than there is for the Terran or resources lost rather 11 more workers So now finally getting into the perfect number of workers, I feel like, as we have an ever-increasing count of Thors. Now, the problem here for the Zerg player is that in order to deal with Thors, you're either going to be needing, most of the time, some kind of Viper to either Blinding Cloud, or you're going to be needing a lot of units just trying to get around catch them off guard I've seen ultras being played against them, not the greatest a lot of the time. Lurker sometimes is an option as well in combination with Vipers, but pure Muta usually isn't the answer as Thor is pretty much the hard counter of the Muta list, right? So, and just pure Broodlord also isn't the answer because Broodlords lost their range in the latest post-BlizzCon patch in which now Thors do a lot of damage to Broodlords Well, they are actually able to do their damage to Broodlords They're able to get in range which definitely is going to be an issue here for our Chinese Zerg player, who still doesn't really have any intent of attacking We see the Terran very intelligently scanning He's like, that's a Lair All right, that's a Lair. You know what? I'm just going to sit back, not do anything, max out. And then once I max out, I'll think about having some action on the map, but not before that. As I say that, he moves out on the map. He varies pretty close to being maxed. He does have a nice army. There's not that many Hellions, which I wouldn't have mined with this Ling down. This is a very bad play here by the Zerg. Holy crap all of this. So another 3K resources lost for a Zerg who was behind in Eco all game long basically. Now he's up in Eco, he's mining more minerals. He is mining slightly less gas, but still looking pretty healthy when it comes to his resource collection A single turret Wouldn't mind seeing a second turret here for the Terran And the Terran decides to move out Mutalisks are doing some harassment, but have these Mutalisks really paid for themselves? I'm not quite sure, honestly So far we've lost five Mutalisks I think a bunch of workers have come down I guess these Mutalisks have kind of paid for themselves The problem is they're, the Mutalisks aren't going to be able to kill this army, right? We're going to need something else And I mean, Banelings are an option and Lings. It sounds silly, but if you actually just blow up the Hellbats, Lings do a really good job against Thors, especially if those Lings have 3/3 upgrades. Adrenal Glands. Which at this point the Zerg definitely has the money for but for some reason he is not researching it we're not seeing any of the tier 3 upgrades for whatever reason. Adrenal Glands of course is a massive increase of damage very good on the Zerglings if 333 on the way here for the Terran as well as building armor. You see the Zerg moving forward doesn't actually get a good surround on a bunch of the Thors we see Hellbats being morphed as well. And the Zerg is going to be able to do some kind of damage No it just gets pushed away Actually evens up the units lost a little bit. So getting closer and closer to that Terran. Actually a bunch of Hellbat Try to kill a Thor with pure gaining It's not quite the most efficient traits If you see him pulling or falling behind by 2K once again Terran, however, is not mining as much anymore you can have slightly less cost-efficient trades, if then you just follow up with a lot of pressure on your opponent's bases and make sure he can't really remax easily In a split-map scenario, efficiency is the only thing that matters, but if you're not in a split-map scenario, then it's fine to take cost-inefficient trades if you're mining a lot more than your opponent, and you're going to be mining more for the rest of the game. It's a weird blink across the map by the Terran He's going to win him some time, actually Let me see the Zerg he's struggling to defend here, but once the Mutas come back, this probably should be an issue Much of drones will end up going down, but, I mean, we just pure Ling, Bane This kind of should be fine, I believe, to defend It's even going in These are not the most cost-efficient traits if you have Banelings rolling into Thors Yeah Even after losing those Battlecruisers, you can see that the Terran still is kind of far ahead now, again and in the Zerg Lost Hive, so the last few fights have been good for him. We do have a, no, we don't have a Greater Spire, we just have plus 3 on air We have a bunch of Corruptors, which are now going to be practically useless The only anti-ground there is are 32 Lings and what appears to be about 7 Mutalisks So Greater Spire is pretty much a must at this point You see a couple of Banelings on the way, which is nice Krifstrut has been pretty good but we're kind of missing the tech switches into faster tech, into those 3-3 upgrades, into the adrenal glands Rebuilding drones at this point would be a wise decision instead of seeing 3 Ultralisks being built. But at this point, we're going to need to see efficient traits for the Zerg because income is completely even, supply is completely even And the Terran army, obviously, is pretty strong. So we're going to need to see some more finesse in the army of the Zerg and that doesn't really seem to be the case so far honestly like Ultras are nice but you're going to need something with it like some kind of Viper some more support and ideally with Ultras your plan is to kill like outside bases with Ultras and Baneling run bys in order to do that though you need very good economy in order to replenish quickly and the economy is just lacking 12 drones are good. But it's once again a little late It feels like all of the tech switches, all of the periods where he's droning, just hit slightly too late in order to truly do something. These Corruptors have been pretty much useless so far and now they're going to fly into the Great Wall of Turrets over here Me meant to keep these Corruptors out. doing a good job Still no Greater Spire on the way, even though plus three is done at this point now I wouldn't mind a couple of Broodlords even though they aren't too great usually against Thors perhaps with some Viper play you can make it work once again we have only seven Mutalisks over here trying to to do something as well 86 workers is fine sir really isn't it feels like just everything is happening slightly too slow he keeps letting the Terran set up an extra base he keeps letting the Terran get away with with moving out and just getting decent again and again and again and once again Terran gets this base, builds another command center, starts moving forward for this top base as well. And Zerg really needs to do something to deny these outside bases because if you allow Terran to just keep moving like this, like if you look at the spread of the Terran at the moment, we see two Terrans or two tanks over here, and this base really only being defended by a single Planetary Fortress This is a vulnerable base Zerg realizes that and goes in That's exactly what he should have been doing, but he should have been doing it a long time ago He should constantly be moved looking for vulnerable places and going in. Because it's very difficult to straight up engage with this army and get a very cost-efficient trade if all you're working with is four Ultras, uh, Lings, Banes and six Mutas with three Overseers here Like that's just, just not good enough Um, you could start thinking about adding some Infestors for neural as well to take over Thors Like, there's lots of ways that you can play and that you can transition and we're just not seeing it from the Zerg player who, uh, well, technically is still on a very rudimentary army The 12 Broodlords, once again, they're good The problem with the Broodlords is, is that the moment that Thors actually had underneath them, that the Thors absolutely wrecked them. So you need something to stop the Thors, whether that's neural, whether that's a lot of Lings that can connect and basically kill the Thors But you can't let the Thors get underneath Mutalisks because they just get destroyed because of their range I like that these Mutas are still alive though I actually do like that I'm forcing a lot of Turrets It's a three Thor split I'm not quite sure why that is the case So we see the Terran completely moving out and the Zerg's like, oh I think I could catch this I think the Zerg can catch this as well It's going to be able to do so It gets a lot of the tanks for free here. And there's only four Thors really, and the Thors are not focusing on the Broodlords now There is some damage being done onto this Ultras, but not that much This was a very good fight for the Zerg player, that we see there's still a big bank for the Terran There's still a couple of Thors, I believe, up here, which will be coming back right now And this is kind of what I mean, like the moment a Thor gets underneath the Broodlords You see, even if there's a lot of Broodlords, a Thor still, you know, he got one Broodlord, almost got a second one So imagine if the Thors, like, if there's no ground support Thors actually completely wrecked Broodlord. There's also no additional anti-air, or just no anti-air whatsoever So a single Viking or a single Battlecruiser will be able to kind of go unchecked Now, this is still a very good situation for the Zerg player But yeah, I'm absolutely no clue how he's going to be losing this game But he's honestly going to be one of the biggest throws if he does manage to lose this one Because he's up 20 workers, he's up about 40 supply He can basically kill all of these mineral lines for free Instead, he decides to push up the van without anti-air, without his Lings with his army Does he have any Lings? He's a bunch of Lings without his Ultras. Just pure Broodlord, which is not even dying against Thors, honestly These Thors, sure, they get a couple of kills Most of those are, of course, broodlings And they will be able to get like an old Broodlord But look at this bad boy This is a Battlecruiser And this Battlecruiser has been in the business of killing Broodlords for a long time This is definitely the MVP who I'm pretty sure managed to kill about seven or eight Broodlords at this point, even though he only has plus one air attack See this is this really wasn't so much Thors as it was just there being no anti-air here for the Zerg player Now two Thors do end up popping. We still have the Zerg being of like 30 workers, 3k income. But the Terran keeps expanding and the Zerg just keeps rallying unit after unit straight into the meat grinder. See unit loss is actually really even and I can bet you after that fight in the middle I think Zerg must have been up like 10, 1011K or something like that. It's just he doesn't have the right unit composition, but even with the wrong unit composition of fighting pure Thor He still should be able to do it just by having better unit movement like trying to deny bases rather than walking into a meat grinder into a siege with Thor that just pops out of the Factory. Honestly, still an okay position for Zerg. I'm not saying it's great anymore, I'm just saying it's okay at this point. Now why is that? Because we have a lot of workers for Zerg, we don't really have enough bases to saturate them. So if this bottom base, it can still be saturated this base, so that's one, two, three, actually, I think he does have enough bases. It's about four and a half base or three and a half base that he still has available, with 81 workers, that should be kind of fine. So it just didn't really distribute his workers well. But these Thors are more Corruptors are being built for some reason. So we now have 21 Corruptors and nothing that shoots the ground, except these spines and three Banelings And all he can build at this point is turn those into Broodlords against a pure Thor army. This is the classic case of the don't have any anti-air units, when there's air and then don't have any anti-ground units when our opponent switches into ground he just got completely outplayed unit one position wise one Battlecruiser managed to kill seven Broodlords and then seven Thors managed to go absolutely insane because the Zerg for some reason decided to only build Corruptors now i'm not one to complain quickly but I feel like at this point someone needs to explain our good Zerg friend here that certain units can and other units can shoot up, but perhaps we can put in a little diagram to show exactly how that works. Maybe explain it by drawing or something like that, but this is not really the way to do it my friend. There is nine Banelings, there's two Ultras and there's two Broodlords on the way, but 13 Corruptors completely useless. They're just going to get wrecked by Thors. Ultras are getting wrecked by Thors. And yeah, I understand why he thinks Thors in, but like Corruptors can't kill them at all. Like, I spent, what, like 4K resources on these Corruptors? Pretty expensive, pretty beefy, supply-intensive unit. These Thors just absolutely destroyed and like, how's that even possible? I guess, pissing on another Command Center. I don't think that's quite going to do it, though. At this point, the work account for the Zerg is lower. At this point, the work account for the Zerg is lower. Supply is pretty close. Army supply is much more in favor of the Terran. The problem is a lot of the army supply is still on the useless Corruptors. I'm not quite sure if this is the game you want to be complaining about. I am not quite sure if this is the game you want to be complaining about. A couple of Hellions going into this Hatchery and slaughtering every Drone that was still left mining. No pretending over here by our Terran player. We have this base mining. We have two bases mining. We have our eight Thors going ham on a single Ultra. We have a couple of Broodlords. Let's see it. More cars moving forward Now, I have to say, I haven't read any Chinese in quite some time, but this word over here, those four characters This means Imba or overpowered This is Thor It's the symbol for Thor, all of these combined And then this means Terran So Thor, Imba, Terran and that's just one word because this guy speaks very fast so well let's let's look at the claim shall we let's look at the claim and what better way to look at the claim then enlarging my face number one early game hot garbage absolutely terrible down what 15 workers I'm pretty sure it is not how he played two-based Muta. I'm not a Zerg expert, but I don't think you're supposed to be down 15 workers. I don't think you're supposed to be floating 9-10 larva. I'm not even sure how it happened. I can't even complain about his injects because his injects were quite good. He just wasn't using the larva. I don't even know how you can do that. It's a different kind of impressive. So he didn't use his larva. He was just down workers, forgot his fourth base, forgot his fifth, then builds three hatcheries at the same time. Techs into Hive forgets that he has a Hive, I think, because for like three minutes of having his Hive, he gets no 3-3, no adrenal glands, no Ultralisk Cavern, no Greater Spire, a single Viper, basically no Hive unit Like, I understand if you really like Lings and Banes, but at least upgrade them on Hive tech Then afterwards, he managed to accidentally catch his opponent of guard in the middle of the map, kills 20 things for free, then decides to go into the natural. with Broodlords without any anti-air, loses eight of them to a single Battlecruiser, keeps attacking into the same base where units are spawning, just into the meat grinder, loses the 10k resources that he won in the fight before, and then as a response to seeing a single Battlecruiser and a single Viking, he builds 21 Corruptors, which then are fighting against nine Thors, then is surprised that the Corruptors don't shoot down. So if we, I think, can do this with my hands actually so imagine you have a unit down here and it can only shoot forward not up um that is not a unit that you want against a unit that is is flying because it it doesn't shoot up it's just shooting shooting straight if you have a unit in the air that only shoots forward and not down your opponent has a lot of units that are down here and the unit only shoots forward, that is also a unit you don't want again. And if there's an air unit of your opponent and you have air units, you might think that's good because air units can always attack, you know, they can attack your... not necessarily true. The Broodlord is a special unit. It can only attack down, as the Broodlord. It shoots down. The Corruptor shoots up. I hope that made sense to you. If it didn't, I have a couple of crayons and a drawing board and I can explain a little more slowly. So be sure to send me an email then. As I do want you to get something out of this. So yeah, you keep so Yeah, this wasn't the Imba. It wasn't even the Terran, mate. It was the Battlecruiser. It really was the Battlecruiser loss of the game, wasn't it? The tours So you were wrong in that as all You really sucked Yeah, that was it Thanks everyone for watching I hope you did enjoy this episode of Is it Imba or do I suck?

        "text": "Hello everyone, welcome back to a new episode of Is It Imba or Do I Suck? Today we got a replay from Mr Panda K-O Now let's have a look at exactly what did he write Hi, so I'm getting sick and tired of Protoss I've been doing the same Mac 2-Base all-in with SCV pull for about two years now because Protoss has been broken for the better part of a decade Yet somehow Protoss still sometimes finds a way to ruin everything I'm doing while I'll still macroing like a champion in the background. I made literally one mistake in this game losing my Reaper and it results in him snowballing with stalkers in my base because he got slightly ahead. As a result he chronos out 60 Probes within minutes, goes on to four bases and puts relentless pressure on me because of this one mistake. It should not be possible to micro like a pro player and also harass my base with dozens of units in the early game in low 4K MMR. I'm not asking you to tell me whether or not Protoss is OP. That much has already been confirmed. I just need you to diagnose which specific mechanic of Protoss is producing this advantage for players so that I can relentlessly email the balance team about the issue. My suspicion is that Chrono Boost is providing this advantage, but it could also be the ridiculous health that Protoss units have been granted. As a Protoss player, I reckon you realize the advantage you have, but I judge you as a good sportsman, so I'm sure you share my goal of getting to the bottom of this once and for all. Please have a look. Thanks. Alright. There's a lot of information to take in, but let's just just, you know, just take the basic claims here that we got out of the email and just put him right in front of us. So the first one is he made only a single mistake, which was losing his Reaper. So that's the first claim we're going to investigate. And then he, as a result, he cranks out 60 probes with minutes, blah, blah, blah, blah. The second thing is that it's possible for the opponent to macro like a pro player and harass his base in low 4K MMR which we'll have a look at and just a side note something to remember um the first line was i've been doing the same mech two base all in with SCV pull for about two years now i just would like you all to remember that just you know as a point of reference as on which we're going to be judging this guy i mean you would assume that if someone has been practicing the exact same build for two years he'd have a decent understanding of how to play it and the execution is going to be rather tight. So if someone says, hey, this is the first time practicing this build, you know, and then you see him make mistakes, you can kind of accept it. But if someone has been practicing the exact same build for two years straight and they make errors, we can judge that way more harshly, whether that be theoretical errors or something like that. It's like someone has been practicing Wonderball for the past two years on the guitar, you know? And they still mess up some chord changes Like, we're going to blast them for that. If it's just a random guy picking up the guitar and he messes something up in Wonderwall, you can still blast them a bit because let's be really, it's Wonderwall but you know, you're going to be a little more lenient. Now, a two-base Mech all-in is basically like playing Wonderwall on the guitar. Everyone can do it, but the question is, do you really want to do it? Most of the time, the answer is no. So here we see the Reaper go in. For some reason, our dear friend already started floating 400 minerals. I've actually no clue how this can happen, but I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation for it. Mr I've been doing the same build for the past two years. He forgets to start his Orbital Command. Oh no, here it goes. It was just three seconds I take back the Orbital Command starting late. So he'll go into Cyclone with the Mag-Field Accelerator, not build a single Marine. So he really only starts with a single Reaper, then goes into a single Cyclone. I feel like there's a lot of builds that die, that he dies to. Imagine if an Oracle shows up or even just like a three gate with chrono-boosted warp gate. Like two three gate units can actually just kill a Cyclone. You usually need a bunker, or at least you need Marines. So if you don't build Marines at all, your whole early game is going to suck. So it seems a bit odd that if you've been doing the same build for two years, that you haven't realized that perhaps spending some of that 600 minerals that you're floating at the three minute mark could be better spent into marines than into anything else. I mean, we're literally four minutes in game and he's floating. You know, let's define floating from now on in command centers. So he's floating practically two command centers at this point. Go straight into four gas. So it's even kind of difficult to be floating minerals at this point because his gas income is so insane. Like he literally could be adding factories. Well, he could be adding two command centers at this point. He should have had way more Marines already Now I know he says he's doing a Mech push, but you just need Marines for safety And also a lot of the early game pushes that Terran can do come from the Marines Like the power from those pushers come from the Marines See the Protoss is actually macroing up pretty nicely Like 42 workers He's playing an actual build order from Blink Robo is perhaps a bit late and the forges are before the third But, you know, shut up. Shut up Mac probably was one of my guides and I was like, I think I can try to copy that, you know, this is the third time Shut Up Meg is playing this build, only floating half a Command Center, well, Panda-K-O, I'm practicing this build for two years, floating two and a half Command Centers at this point And like I said, no Bunker, no Tanks It means that whenever Stalkers come in, they'll just be able to snip a Cyclone, and you're just going to be in a little bit of trouble So, so far we're five minutes in game and Panda K L managed to create five units, three of the which died. Well, at this point all five of them have died, but it was four Cyclones and a single Reaper. That's all he built in the first five and a half minutes in the game. And I'm not quite sure he thinks this is the most efficient build to get to his two-base Mech all-in, but I have a feeling it might not quite be. Rally is a Cyclone down the ramp straight into Stalkers. Some could consider that a mistake, but Panda-KO is just, you know, Stalkers are too strong down the ramp. How is it possible to go in there? I'd like to make everyone aware that this indeed is 4.5k MMR. You have Barracks building in the opponent's base now. Wait what? Armory going down at the 6 minute mark Now, usually when you're doing an all-in, you want to be hitting as tight as possible, and you want your upgrade, if you're getting one, to finish with your first or second cycle of peak of production So imagine you're playing an eight gate as a Protoss, after one or two warpins of all eight gateways, you want to be hitting with that, because that's when you're at your peak, basically Now, you want that production cycle peak to kind of coincide with an upgrade So getting an Armory this late when you're doing a two-base mech all-in, usually isn't that great Now, this Reaper should do absolutely nothing. Like proxying a barracks and then saving up two Reapers to go snipes on Probes Makes absolutely no sense. His opponent, however, is making quite some sense. I mean, there's not a lot of scouting, but at least the build he's doing makes sense, right? There's no scouting from the Terran either. He has four bases, he has two gases, and he's just going mass Stalker Zealot. He's macroing quite well. Like, he honestly hasn't been floating too much money for how much money the ProDLS has been getting. Meanwhile, Panda Keo, whenever, you know, he gets an income that's above 1,200, he starts floating a couple of Command Centers. We have a couple of tanks now being added as well. Plus one hasn't started. yet even though the Armory has been done for what 40-50 seconds and once again just move now now he just moves out without any vision on the map completely unseached he didn't check with any Hellions what his opponent was doing just gets blinked absolutely dies it absolutely dies it's hard to imagine that someone would look at this game and think, you know what? You know what? I think the other race here is the issue I think the main thing that went wrong here is that the other race is too strong I think if that's what you think, then you're not the brightest fella, not the sharpest tool in the shed So it was a pretty short replay. It was only eight minutes and 13 seconds. But I think we have some material here, boys. All right. Put ourselves a little bit bigger. My friend, Panda Keo, it starts with you losing the Reaper. That was your first mistake, but definitely not your last. It was your first mistake, but definitely not your only mistake. Afterwards, you decide to have probably one of the worst build orders in the world. So you come back to the to the Wonderwall analogy here. Basically what you've been doing. You've been telling your friends for two years that you've been playing Wonderwall again and again. And you're an absolute master of Wonderwall. And then your friends are like, all right, you can show us, you know? They show us how to play Wonder One Tell them, no, no We don't need to quite yet I want to show you guys I want to practice a bit more until I have it perfected Then after two years of holding them off alright, Pantakeo, like, sit down with us, show us how well you play Wonderwall And take out your guitar and you start playing You just play happy birthday And you play it with the wrong chords in the wrong rhythm And they're like, hey, like Panda Keo, are you warming up or is this Wonderwall? And I like, nah, nah, nah Like, this is Wonderwall, guys, really. This is, this is Wonderwall. This is what it sounds like. Oh my God, I can't believe it. What you've been doing for the past two years is the worst Macro I've seen in my life. This is not a build order. This is not Wonderwall. This is some abomination of a Macro. The Protoss player played, honestly, he played pretty decent. I mean, he didn't do anything special. He just walked across the map with two units, killed a Cyclone. Then he walks across the map with seven units and he killed the rest of your Cyclones. You had no units. You had no defense. You had no scouting on the map. Your map vision was absolutely terrible. Like, the only map vision you had was a Barracks in your opponent's base, which you randomly build to go save up some Reapers I have no clue how that makes any sense in your head But, I mean, after sending that email, I already figured something is wrong there So I really don't have, like, it was a short replay, but there's so many thoughts in my head and so many different insults I want to hurl at you that it's painful that you manage to invoke this much emotion out of me in such little time Usually it takes people 20, 25 minutes of garbage play for me to go absolutely ham on them. But you've managed to do it in a mere eight, which is actually kind of impressive in a way. But it also just makes me wonder if perhaps this just isn't for you, you know, if this is the best you're going to be able to do after two years of practicing a single build order and you're floating 800 minerals at the three, three minute mark, perhaps It's time to find a slower hobby. You could think of gardening even though I'm not quite sure how well you'd be able to keep your plants alive if you can't follow basic instructions like a bill order but you know something with a little less speed that someone that might be in their 80s would still be able to do because that's the speed you're you're handling everything in this game I hope you understand that you absolutely suck this was completely terrible yeah just Don't do this again Your email was quite funny and well written I'll give you that But I'm afraid that you actually meant it, which means you might have some brain defect So you might want to get that checked out as well. So yeah, just some general advice for you, like get into gardening, get some checkups at the hospital just to make sure everything's all right. And speedy recovery to you, man. Keep practicing Wonderwell. All right. If you did enjoy this video, forget to subscribe to my YouTube channel. It helps me a lot. Smash the like button. And yeah, that's it. That's it for today. Short episode. But that's fine sometimes as well. It's not the size that matters, but it's how well you use the time in the replay. Yeah, see you all next time. Bye."

        "text": "Hello Kevin. Zerg macro is actually ridiculous. In this game I kill 64 of his workers with Adepts and he still manages to win the game. It's absurd. I can't believe how he can have units on the field similar to mine with that big of a worker loss. I actually can't believe it. My APM was about 50 higher and my EPM was also about 20 higher. I know the problem was probably not being able to close the game but still. We lost similar units in terms of the unit lost debt, but he lost 64 workers and he still for workers and he still had stronger economy and powerful army. Something is not right here. Thanks, Josh, Diamond 3, Protoss. Welcome to a new episode of Is It Imba or Do I Suck? Today we're going to be having a look at a replay from our boy Josh, as you can hear. So let's hop straight into it. It's going to be played on Simulacromo and Josh says he killed a lot of workers. He killed a lot of workers. And yet, he was not capable of winning the game, which is obviously an issue. Usually if you do a lot of economical damage, whether that be at the start or later in the game, you're going to be able to push that advantage. But Josh said, you know what, Kevin? I killed a lot of workers, a little eco-damage. I couldn't kill my opponent. I even had higher APM and higher EPM Now you know if someone has higher APM, that truly means business Because being able to spam buttons very fast, has always been a very good good indicator of skill So now I'm truly worried that that Zerg might actually be imba and I'm very curious to investigate this claims made by George So his main issues with the economy that it's too strong that even if you kill 60 workers, the Zerg can just rebuild his worker All right First interaction, I guess goes in favor of the Zerg player As George is, it's loses his first Probe, Josh. Why would you do that? Place two Gateway? Cybernetics Core, no gas, second pylon on the low ground, and then a gas Now I've seen a lot of builds that aren't builds, but out of all the builds that I've seen that aren't builds, this is the build that is the the least a build out of all of the builds that aren't builds This makes absolutely zero sense, a couple of reasons His gas is going to be so late that neither of his Gateway can produce a Cybernetics Core unit He might be able to build a single Adept But no, he'll need to wait Warp Gate is going to be delayed Nexus, I'm not even sure why this is it. Like there's a build order, which actually plays two gate This ain't it This is not the build order that is actually a two gate Like there are double Adept openers like this, but they're absolutely not like this You would still wall on the low ground as well An issue you're going to see now for Josh as we go into this game is that in order to secure the low ground, he's going to need three more structures here, which either means he's going to need to put his Stargate into his natural, which shows his opponent exactly what he's doing, or he'll need to just wall kind of artificially with gateways Because let's just imagine the regular timing of Zergling speed being around 340, 350. Before 350, Josh needs to wall with three big buildings over here in order for Lings not be able to get in That's simply going to be impossible, and that's why you can't just build all your buildings on the high ground It's not good So he opens up with two gate, and he's hitting with his two Adepts at the same time as I would hit with a one gate expand He tries to walk into his opponent's mineral line for a bit and He gets a Drone, shades into the main, probably we'll get one or two more Drones So far he's done five Drones six Drones. I mean this is a good start all right I'll admit this start is good is so bad that even if his start is good, it still kind of sucks, you know? At this point, I'd say that Josh is at, though, like his opponent's only on two base There's a fast Lair on the way, but I don't mind So yeah, like I said, he's going to need to put his Tech in the wall, so it's going to be a free scout here for reserve player Josh follows up with two Stalkers, a Twilight Council and a Robotics Facility So 2 Gate into 3 Gate, Twilight, Robo I'm not quite aware of this build, obviously He still doesn't have a wall, which, let's be real. Speed has finished at this point. 10 Lings would be able to basically win the game. Well, 20 Lings. If there was an actual Ling flood here, the game would be pretty much over. Now we have Spire on the way for for the Zerg player. Josh is not aware of that but he saw the Lair so he should know, hey, Lair on the way. I can expect either a Nydus or maybe Hydralisks or Mutalisks, like these are the options that there are currently are. Still hasn't completely walled off at the five minute mark, Prism on the way. What the hell? He just starts moving across the map. Just starts moving across the map. Nothing to save him, no upgrades. No timing either because Glaives, God knows Glaives are still about 40 seconds away from being done So he's just going to be on the map without really having any reason for it We see the Zerg players trying to get Mutas out I think he'll be able to get a couple of Mutas out before Glaives finishes So the issue here for Josh just is that his build doesn't make any sense He isn't really producing workers There's no third base yet There's no He's playing some weird version of the four-gate Glaive build For reference, the four-gate Glaive build hits at 428 or 427 with a Pylon scout, while having more workers than our boy Josh had at this point. When Josh is hitting a minute and a half later. So it's not the greatest execution so far. So here come the glaives. Now there is a spine. Mutas will get shown for the first time now. See what the response is against the Mutalisk. Well, the response so far is building a forge at home and just continuing using the glaives of death. He hasn't killed that many workers with these glaives at all he's killing a fair amount. The problem is that at this point the Mutas are the biggest threat. So if you kill 10 workers that's nice, you really got to be careful of Mutalisks. Like you need to be able to defend your mineral lines, you need to be able to not die the moment your opponent flies across the map, right? I mean there's six Mutalisks now, they should be able to be dealt with a couple of Stalkers. So in my opinion what you do here is you immediately start Blink and one Cannon per mineral line. And you just keep warping in Stalkers. The moment from the moment on the solves in the release Josh's response is to make a maze of Cannons. Well, I'm not even sure quite what they're in. He gets five Cannons, literally protecting every single structure he has, or trying to protect every single structure he has. And he starts double Stargate. So he just invested five cannons, a crap tonne of money And then went double Stargate Instead of just, he could have also just gotten one cannon per mineral line, then a couple of stalkers and then get like double Stargate afterwards if you really want to I don't think Double Stargate is the answer here So even though Josh did a lot of damage at this point, he also lost a fair amount in the unit. loss tab and because his eco was a little worse before you see that he's down 25 supply he has no real upgrades there's 16 mutas against three stalkers right now so there's no real anti-air there's a third base ready already for the Zerg player so Josh needs to really start thinking about a third base that's what needs to start thinking about how he's going to be dealing with those Mutalisks because Phoenix are good but Having such a low Phoenix count against such a high muta count usually is an issue Another issue that I like this run-down Pulling the Mutas back is good. In this case, what he should have done is he cancelled two Adepts, so he basically is attacking two bases at the same time And he also would have been able to get these eight-nine workers This Zerg responses so far have been a little bit underwhelming to say the least. Well, this does look pretty good. Good, I have to admit, I mean, he kills a lot of workers But the thing with killing workers is that killing workers only really matters if you are also getting workers and you're getting economy Josh hasn't really been losing too many workers, but he's just on 39 workers He doesn't have a third base He doesn't really have any units to speak of whatsoever. He kind of got caught of guard by the Mutalisk altogether like he didn't know that was going to happen he lost all of his Glaive Adepts he doesn't he isn't really preparing anything for a longer game just getting more and more Phoenixes and i mean at this point his opponent is equal again in worker count and in a couple of seconds his opponent's going to start out mining him the way you want to micro Phoenixes against Mutalisks is that you fly away from them while abusing your range so you're faster than Mutalisks you have slightly more range So you try to poke in, poke in, poke out, poke in, poke out. Something that helps a lot, actually, when you have your Phoenixes, is getting a couple of Shield Batteries because you're always going to make mistakes in the micro. And Photon Cannons don't help as much with that, because Photon Cannons, they just protect the general area. The nice thing about Shield Batteries is that you can always go back to it to get healed. And they have longer range of healing, basically. So if there's a Shield Battery here, you can fly here safely. Well, if there's a Photon Cannon here, flying here with your Phoenixes is still kind of risky. So I much would prefer to see some Shield Batteries being added as well. Now we have Infestation Pit, 55 workers. So even though at this point already 50 workers have been killed, it doesn't look quite as good for Josh Simply because this is the first time in six minutes that he's increasing his worker count. He doesn't really have any army whatsoever to speak of. His upgrades are equal with the Zerg but rather tough. Mostly I do like the harass. The continued effort to keep harassing. That's good but he's gonna need quite a lot of harass to be able to get into this game because he's down 12, 13 workers. He's going to be down two bases at some point and the upgrades in fact for the Zerg player is a lot better here. Here come the Phoenixes. This time he does use a decent micro You see a couple of Hydralisks coming out now And Josh doesn't really have anything ready for these Hydralisks He's not really aware of attack switches in general Response to seeing Hydralisks is three more Photon Cannons, which I would have much preferred seeing the response of getting Charge, Templar Archives, and he's getting a Templar Archives, and then adding a couple of Gateways. Gateways like this cannon makes no sense whatsoever like this base is going to be pretty safe right if you have three cannons if your opponent has enough to kill three cannons majority of the time they're gonna have enough to kill six cannons as well like the most important things are going to be to increase your Gateway count increase worker count which is something that once again he isn't doing and and to really work on that tech so getting High Templars getting those Immortals making sure that the Probes you mine to your base are actually going to be mining, you know, that kind of stuff Get plus two perhaps for ground weapons. Instead, obviously, Starcraft 2 is he just gets three Adepts and he starts walking across the map again It feels like his entire plan in PvZ is to move across the map with Adepts and try to kill as many Drones as possible and hope the opponent leaves, because there doesn't seem to be anything of a follow-up plan So he starts researching Storm, gets four Templar, which made me pretty happy then he morphed them straight into Archons Obviously when you're getting storm, what you want to do is you want to Even if you're afraid, if your opponent attacking you, you want to keep your Templar not morphed into Archons for as long as possible, basically. And then when you get attacked, and you don't have storm yet, you can always still morph them into Archons But what he did now is not that great So we see a couple of Templar Actually, good eco for the first time, or at least better eco than his opponent. still not in gas but should be kind of fine charge starting plus two is starting immortals are starting so at this point he's actually in a pretty decent position he needs to be aware of that there is a hive and that there's a Greater Spire on the way I would love to see a run by with some Zealots or something like that now there's a couple of storms ready not quite enough to fight straight into this but defensively and Josh is definitely going to be fine. At this point, he can probably start thinking about a fourth base as well, can't he? So he has plenty of money in the bank He has a pretty good defensive position here. So this could be a decent fourth base where he can take this as a fourth base. Jesus This is one of the slower games I've seen. Honestly It's really wild, Diamond 3 We have a complete, I think this is F2 movement now. The Phoenixes are in there. Everything is in. There's no unit in a wall Hellion he doesn't even have a wall yet couple a couple of Photon Cannons just spread around and here comes josh here comes josh with the timing attack 14 minutes 112 supply. No too scary because we're going he does have a lot of High Templar actually does have a lot of High Templar charge is done now so the way you want to attack in any matchup is by doing two things at the same time so you queue up three Zealots into this fourth base which Josh actually is aware of and then you walk through the middle perhaps clear some creep At the moment Broodlord hit the field you either you want one of three things. So you either want Tempest, you want Carrier or you want a lot of Blink Stalkers I'm usually not a massive fan of the Blink Stalker thing, but it is possible to do Some people say why not Void Rays, well, it's about 35 Hydra, so Void Rays aren't that reliable in this case Now, actually get a pretty decent fight there for George, I believe, who basically stormed the entire army of his opponent We'll end up losing a couple of his Templar, but if he recalls this, this fight actually wasn't that bad He also has nine gateways, which means he can warp in a lot of Zealots at once I don't think he did Instead he queues up eight phoenixes. Instead of using any of his nine Gateway he prefers using the queue function in the Stargate to get Phoenixes against someone who still has a bunch of Corruptors and has shown a tendency to build Hydras Phoenixes are probably the worst Broodlord counter there is because they kill Broodlords extremely slow and they die against everything Like two Corruptors and a Hydra will be able to beat like five Phoenixes. basically or at least they will be able to win so much time that the Broodlords kill the entire ground army I'm not a big fan of the Phoenix counter here to put it mildly the worst part is that it's actually working this is there's nothing worse than bad decisions except when those bad decisions work out me trying to validate the wrong opinion of people it absolutely triggers the crap out of me when this happens like Phoenix is definitely not the answer to this composition Well, to this composition, Phoenix might be an answer, but just any anti-air would completely destroy it. Once again, Josh really using that F2 button, like his life depends on it. As you see, there's no anti-air, if he just uses the Phoenixes separately from the rest of his army, he would be able to at least kill all of these Broodlords free It is actually making me angry that he is now filling Broodlords with Phoenixes This is not supposed to be The only reason this is a thing is because the Zerg didn't have any anti-air whatsoever to speak off Which also makes me angry So if this Zerg would also want to send in this replay from his side, then I'm down to do that as well, Richard You are making me a sad person, making it harder to criticize Josh over here. I can't believe that Josh actually is ahead in supply at this point He has four bases He has cannons He's getting plus three An incorrect counter Two Broodlords, but it actually does seem to be working Our Zerg player actually is kind of struggling at this point 17 minutes in game, army composition for George 128 supply, has two Archons, a couple of storms, and seven Phoenixes I'm a big fan of this So this is what I was talking about Once the Corruptor count gets too big, the Phoenixes just don't have anything to say anymore. So now, if anything turns into big, turns into Broodlords imagine he builds eight Broodlords and then still has five Corruptors remaining that would be absolutely fantastic because then what is Josh gonna do here he has no anti air except for three Phoenixes and a couple of Archons but Archons can never move forward against Broodlords instead what we're going to be seeing is a five Ling run by and a single Broodlord I Absolutely no clue what's happening in this game We haven't seen a single multitask attack yet I think anyone really That's a hell of a storm as well Kills three Lings and takes away HP on one of his Archon It's now the Corruptors kill everything that's in the air. And the single Broodlord pushes away this army One second, one second, one second One second, one second I want to have another look at that storm Slow motion, slow motion Slow motion So you manage to hit four Zerglings with one of your storms for a millisecond because they only got like one damage stick or something like that You missed everything else Was this really worth the one storm? No, that wasn't Another thing is that there's literally a single Broodlord If you look at the units right now, there's a single Broodlord and 15 Corruptors. Why are you running? Why? Why are you not just sending Zealots into every single base? Why aren't you just killing the Broodlords that are morphing in front of your base? No, single Broodlord, let's go back It's too strong He has range Look This feels like the way an AI plays, you know, with these weird moves If a probe attacks one of the barracks, that he pulls seven workers The moment Josh gets attacked by a single Broodlord, he's like, oh no, I don't have phoenixes Let me just move back But now that he has two phoenixes, he suddenly got the confidence to start fighting into five Broodlords How does this make any sense? He actually is an AI. But no AlphaStar, you know, he's the crappy ones that keep bumping into walls The color, whoa, douche, oh, whoa, dush He actually plays like a crappy AI This is fantastic First Zealot run by at the 20 minute mark Instead of a moving it, right clicks on the hatchery on the hatchery That is some higher level stuff This really is some good stuff Loses nine Zealots for free All you need to do is A move, mate All you need to do is A move The Zealots do the work themselves at that point Four Phoenixes are out, we'll be able to clear half a Broodlord before dying Right now George, like, oh crap, Fleet Beacon, I probably could have built that earlier. earlier, realizes just in time before his, well this was his third base falls to Broodlord, was down a hundred supply, down 22 workers Let me just expand to the bottom side, perhaps I still have a chat Right now I'm sure there's 10 Broodlords and 12 Corruptors, but I still have Phoenix I think he has a very big trust in Phoenix for some reason Whenever he has a Phoenix, his army movement gets way bolder and also he just seems to, you know, still believe in his chance out here, come another couple of Zealots, right clicking on a Hatchery somewhere across the map Savage is killing Drones that are walking around for free At this point, Josh is just wasting everyone I'm saying, G G. will play. That's great, Josh. I'm glad you, you decided it was time to go. I mean, really? Do you want me to go over it. All right, let's do it. Your issue was that the economy of the Protoss player was too strong. His economy really wasn't that great for a very long time. I mean, it was okay. The main issues were that, first of all, you had no wall. You had no build order. You had no real plan either except make Zealot Adept kill drones, which that plan worked. Then you realized that plan wasn't quite as complete as you believed it to be. You went into Double Stargate Phoenix, 12 Photon Cannons. Your third base started at the 10-minute mark. You started producing workers again at the 9-minute mark You just had like a casual five-minute breaks of getting any sort of economy Because I don't know, but you just didn't see what like it maybe Then afterwards, you actually get into a really big winning position where you're up 20 supply You don't scout Broodlords You haven't scouted any of the transitions You didn't know about the hydras You didn't know about the Mutalisks You didn't know about the Broodlords You didn't know about the corruptors Once you figure out it was Broodlords, you started Phoenix production, which is the incorrect thing So that's also terrible Then at one point, you actually kill his entire army, except for 15 corruptors and one Broodlord. You still have Carrier left and you decide now is the perfect time to go and walk back to your fourth base Then you finally get the balls again, but then the Broodlord attacks you into some AI-like moves and you just run back until you get two Phoenixes Then you decide all of a sudden it's fine to attack into six Broodlords and 15 Corruptors, which, you know, the one Broodlord turned into four or into five You did zero run by, she had no map vision whatsoever Once again, your builder really sucked I would love to stress that a couple more times, like how bad your early game really was And then the Zealot move, right-clicking the Hatchery, might want to use a move there. I mean, there's just so much to talk about. Like, honestly, you could have killed 150 units. With the way you play, you probably still wouldn't have managed to lose this game. You're the kind of guy that they bring out in challenge, you know? When there's a challenge where pro play, or plays against a person who gets a five minute head start. You're the kind of guy capable of losing that, you know? All the credit going to the other. Like you managed to lose positions and to play as slow and as poor as you did for other people would require a lot of effort. If I were to try and play like you, I don't think I would manage. Because just out of my habits, I would be doing things so much better. And I think most people would have that, Josh. You, this game, were quite a failure. And thus, you suck. Very, very hard. All right. It's going to be it for today's episode of Is it Imba or do I suck? I did hope you enjoyed it. If you did, don't forget to subscribe to my YouTube channel or click on one of the videos on the side or above or whatever they put. And I'll see you all next time. Bye-bye. Thank you."

        "text": "Hello Kevin, big fan of all your content Your guys help me learn a lot I know I don't execute them perfectly But hey, why should I? If I'm a 4 4K, you brain that Protoss player has been touched inappropriately by roaches too many times I play different styles Clave adapts, DTs, blink DTs, Blink DTs, Stargate, two base all-ins, but all of them have one thing in common The bug on the other side of the map just holds the R button for too long and kills me no matter what I do. This game I have a near-perfect build-up to six minutes, losing nothing early, staying ahead of my opponent's eco the entire game, while I scout my opponent perfectly, and I'm able to pick off a few Drones here and there with Oracles without losing them, don't forget about that He doesn't lose his Oracles What a micro god Hell, I even expect a Roach attack from him, and he walks up in the worst possible choke But it doesn't matter, because the Roach printer pumps out so many units I just can't deal with it Much love, Brady The title of this is Roach printer go brr. Welcome to Is it Imba or do I suck where today we will be investigating whether roaches are overpowered or if Brady sucks. Now it's a very difficult question to answer usually but it's just the main the main claim that i want to be looking at is the first six minutes right he says i played the first six minutes near perfect which i have pretty high standards for near perfect. So let's have a look at exactly how near perfect it is what he's truly doing here he's playing against SRBS is a Zerg player seems to be aware of what is the proper opening here now gas first coming out of Brady which is completely fine if you're not scouting it allows you to get slightly more gas rather than rather than getting more minerals or sending out a scout because the moment your gas finishes, usually you get an extra worker. So right now you can rally it straight into the gas. Usually you want full saturation on the mineral, so you don't need the gases early. If this probe would go across the map to scout. I hope that made some sense. It's going to be a no scout. And this opening all looks pretty tidy. I love it. I love it. Overlords flying across the map. You have a wall that actually looks like it might wall something. So, you know, already big improvements being made over the guy from last week who I think forgot to warp in for what was it the first eight or nine minutes of the game. So we're already seeing some semblance of an actual video game which is nice to see. You know, it's nice every once in a while to see a game where at least the first one minute and 33 seconds seem somewhat normal. I do have to admit that the Cybernetics Core is a little late which means this Gateway must have been a little late as well. This is a full wall; it doesn't look like it but it is. How the rocks work, I believe it is at least. And we'll figure it out later otherwise Moves to the watchtower Get a second Pylon at an appropriate timing So maybe the first six minutes aren't near perfect, but at least the first two minutes are indeed absolutely fantastic And I am starting to get this weird feeling in my stomach voice This might be the week This might be the week where we figured out that the Roaches are actually overpowered because this guy, he seems to be right I mean, he's doing everything correct So far This is the perfect game Okay, he's getting Warpgate before any tech He's not getting any tech Warpgate before tech Even this, I don't mind This could be a trick Tricking your opponent. Hey, look, I'm getting Warpgate before any tech This is not Stargate So it's a little bit of a trick I don't mind that I don't mind that at all Stalker as a second unit makes sense Almost constant Probe production Man, this actually is looking good We're three minutes in game and we might actually have to approve his claim that this is the best six minutes that is possible This opponent's scouting around the map This is a good level game It's very weird that sometimes I watch like the 4K players and they play like they're, you know, it's like they're playing Red Alert or something Like I've never seen a game like they apparently play on a daily basis. And then this guy is also 4 4 He's playing a fantastic early game Nothing wrong here Forgets his Oracle for a little bit So that's not quite perfect Yeah, it's on the way, it's maybe 10 seconds later or so Honestly, I'm not too disappointed so far here, my friend I'm not too disappointed so far We have no Chronoboost on the workers though I wouldn't mind seeing one or two extra Chronoboost on the workers Get a little more Probe, get a little more money I think a second Gateway usually is necessary as well Third gas is too fast Okay, it plays Oracle Phoenix. A lot of the time when you're going to be playing Oracle Phoenix, it's better to play Adept, Adept, Adept, rather than Adept Stalker. Because the Phoenix basically does what your Stalker does, and that's denying scouting So there's no real use in getting that Stalker in that case. Get a Robotics Facility, relatively quickly A third base as well I mean, this is a bit of an old build order, but it's still a build order of some sort. So first four minutes, near perfect I wouldn't mind that I think we can agree on that. I think we can agree on that actually Phoenix is getting some kills as well He got some kills with this Oracle Like the start here is looking absolutely fantastic. I'm getting afraid that we might have to approve his first claim of the almost perfect first six minutes. Okay, here's a big supply block. This is a painful supply block as well because this is with the second Oracle. That's a little painful. Okay, it's not near perfect. It's not that difficult to not get supply blocked. It gets a Forge. If he gets a Twilight Council, yeah? The build order here makes a lot of sense. This is very close to what I recommended to casually explain as well to do. It's one of the better build orders. Whenever, this is a mistake. It should always be right in the little nook over here or over here. And he still gets a pretty decent trade here. I'm happy with that He continues his worker production He is not getting an Observer or an Immortal This actually is a huge error because you want to be seeing what your opponent is doing as fast as possible with that Observer And already right now, yeah, this is really late Okay, so this is, this is actually kind of a big mistake Also, not having the second Oracle yet is kind of annoying General lack of map vision I mean, the Adepts are really not doing anything. They could be either holding this tower over here, or the adepts could be trying to do some damage on the other side, perhaps move to this tower, clear creep over here, or maybe in unison with these two or try and do some damage He's not doing any of that, which I'm not a massive fan of. Now, we actually are seeing a lot of money floating right now, so it is not perfect Let's be real here. We're going to pause at six minutes and do a small mid-game review. We don't usually do that, but I think he made such a strong claim on the first six minutes being near perfect that I think we're just going to have a look at the state of the game at six minutes So mid-game review Ding da-da-ding, ding, ding, ding That's the theme song for the mid-game review I made it myself just now We have an Observer staying at home, not scouting anything He's been at home for quite some time, at least 28 seconds. Now, you could say, how do you know he's been here 28 seconds? Couldn't it be a Chronoboost on the Robotics Facility? And the Observer's only been at home for what? 20 seconds or 18? No, because we see Chronoboost hasn't really been used at all whatsoever I mean, it could be possible in theory, but I don't think our main character, the protagonist, has been using Chronoboost So that's another mistake No scouting, no Chronoboosting on Probes, no Chronoboosting on upgrades Near perfect game, but floating 1200 minerals Near perfect game, but floating 460 gas Near perfect game, but not producing workers from one of your Nexus Harass has been pretty okay He killed six workers. of links I think he's actually up in workers which he said he was but he's he should be at least up to six gates by now he should probably have gas five and six on the way if you actually follow the proper build order were the first six minutes near perfect the answer is no definitely no. Let's continue so the first claim has kind of been disproven. Lots of money floating, lots of Chrono Boost floating, not constant probe production, poor scouting. So these are the first three points we have. SimCity here looks pretty terrible. You want to be walling off part of your Nexus, not the entire part of your Nexus. Because now imagine the Zerg positions himself over here. All these Gateways are going to be three real estate for him, where he just can kill them and you can't move through this choke You're creating a massive choke for yourself So most of the time you only build one or you build two Gateways So you have a lot of space for your army to move through to defend those Gateways as well, necessary So you say you scouted roaches or you knew they were coming, but you haven't really seen that much You don't really seem prepared either The scouting info you have so far is that he didn't take the gases on his third base and you know nothing about the main base. And then all of a sudden, what is it, 20 roaches show up, 14 roaches and 6 ravagers You have a single Immortal Like, this is not quite what you want Now, in this kind of situation, we look at the response What is the panic response here from our Protoss player Brady Now, he should be getting Void Rays should be Chronoboost He should be getting Immortals, should be Chronoboost Perhaps a Battery here or there Perhaps a Cannon using your warp-ins as efficiently as possible Using your Oracles to target down ravagers because that gives a more damage to ravagers None of these things is happening Instead, he builds a prism, which is definitely a wrong call. But this roach push actually gets completely destroyed. Even though a lot of the response wasn't very clean He didn't really scout and he wasn't ready. He still managed to completely destroy the roach push, which is a good thing. So now what you would think is, well, you keep your observer here and you see more roaches coming What is the response to more roaches coming? Probably Immortals, probably an extra cannon, probably a Void Ray, warping in units, not getting supply block, not floating 2K minerals. All of these things are usually quite good to do especially the not floating at this point, 2 5K resources, basically As we see in a response to floating this many resources, he builds Gateways. Now it's easy to say, well, you don't need this many Gateways on three base, which probably is true, but in this case, it's better to invest into something and into nothing. I'm just going to go back into the replay I'm sorry. Because, okay, he has a good point position here, all he needs to do is Force Field the ramp. You know? One, two, three. Doesn't happen. Biles. Just standing in the Biles. Do you see that? He just attacks his own Stalker here. So first of all, he misses his Force Fields, he attacks his own Stalker, he stands in the Biles. If he just puts down three Force Fields, this game is completely over again. Even if he just gets a single Void Ray. This game is really, really good for him. I feel like there are so many things here that Breddy already could have been improving on that his first six minutes weren't good, but minutes six till 8 30 were quite awful, almost with negative micro. We call it negative micro in the pro scene when someone micro something, but it would have been better left unmicroed. And I think in Breddy, this might be the case, because whatever he's doing with his unit seems to actually make them perform worse than I thought was possible. All the while floating 2 3k resources. Losing a third base. At this point the game is pretty over. Breddy has shot his shot. He has lost his third base. He's lost some probes. There's not much he can do anymore. At this point, Brady is fuming at home. He's boiling. His head is becoming all red. and he's probably screaming to his friends that are watching him play live because he told him he's so good at this video game I swear guys I'm very good because the Roaches meanwhile the other guy playing with one hand injecting with his eyes closed a moving Roach across the map and our boy braddy calls gg not brady brady brady brady brady brady brady brady brady brady brady i kind of want to have a quick look at the email again flashback what did we read the bug on the other side of map just holds the r button for too long and kills me no matter what I do this game I have a near perfect build up to six minutes losing nothing early staying ahead of my opponents economy the entire game well I scout my opponent perfectly okay so first of all you might have scouted your opponent perfectly you did see the Roach Warren actually you didn't even see the main base you didn't know the Drone count you didn't know how many gases he was on. And actually just scouting perfectly, even if you had, which I think you had enough information to know something aggressive was coming You saw less than six gas, only four, usually indicates roach aggression or Ling Bane aggression or just pure Ling aggression So you saw this The problem is you don't react Like you scouted it and you didn't react That's not a very good thing to do in life That is not a very good thing to do in life You're the kind of guy that stands on the side of the road and you see like a car coming your way and you go, there's a car coming my way He's like, oh, that looks kind of dangerous. And you just keep standing there until the car hits you and then you complain in the hospital What was I supposed to do? Like I knew he was coming, but he's like, well, yeah, if you know the car is coming, move to the side, you idiot Same here in Starcraft You scout the Roaches are coming and you just jump in front of the car This is the wrong move What you're supposed to do, supposed to get Immortals, get your Photon Cannons, get your Shield Batteries, get your, spend your money in general, avoid raise for all I care You macroed pretty terribly You forgot the Force Field, the ramp Your Oracle control is pretty good I'll give you that I liked your Oracle control. I did like your first six minutes, except for the fact that your gateways were too late But yeah, honestly, just no micro Not enough units macro to poor are Protoss Imba no they're not you just really suck my friend that's the reality of the case all right everyone thanks so much for watching if you did enjoy this video don't forget to subscribe to my YouTube channel up here if you want to see more videos like this go here if you want to see my latest video go here also I have social media in this corner Twitter my Patreon and my Twitch which I'll be streaming daily from around 4 p m.

        "text": "Dear Harstam, I've had to deal with Zerg for what feels like ages, and I'm not sure what to do I feel like every time I get ahead with a successful push, they just tech switch and win the game anyway Are Muta Zerg imba, or do I suck? Because it feels like every time I'm in a winning position, it's stolen from me All capital understolen, of course All right, Mr Basherslice Let's have a look to see if Zerg is Imba or if you suck and specifically Mutas, I think, what's the issue here that you mentioned So let's hope straight into it here on Simulacrum, one of the older maps actually Curse how we got a new replay on one of the old maps. That's going to be interesting to think about. All right, we have ourselves here Mr Basherslice was a 4 4K player, a Pro, Not sure what server he's on, but maybe my editor managed to find out and there will be a little pop-up now. Now, he's struggling with Mutalisk. Now, whenever you see someone struggle with Mutalisk, this is usually because a couple of reasons: A. they don't build anti-air. B. they don't have base defense. And C. they attack into someone who has Mutalisk, then lose into a base trade. These are the usual reasons why people lose against Mutas. A lot of the time the correct play to do against Mutalisks is just to do nothing and get Photon Cannons and Shield Batteries and just sit there till you have max supply and then you move out while chronoing out Phoenix basically off of a single Stargate. Majority of the time this is going to be enough against Phoenix so the main things we're going to be looking at here is of course the early game then see how he transitions into a midgame what his economic position is and how he deals with Mutalisks eventually but we always start with the build order and so far this is looking absolutely fantastic voice. Voice i'm loving this so Cybernetics Core sound at 160 minerals see only 10 minutes late this is something i could do as well 21st probe gets an Assimilator please uh okay Assimilators one supply late Oh, gets a Pylon before the Assimilator. That's definitely an error stops work in production. It's a bit yikes here. It's a bit yikesy. You're supposed to get a 21 assimilator 22 pylon never stopped pro production, of course. But we can forgive him for these minor errors. If what he says is true and Mutalisks are actually broken, then it doesn't matter if you have an assimilator three seconds earlier. Like, I mean, if they're actually broken, then it doesn't even matter at all what you do, because Mutalisks are going to win. anyway so the Stargate man I'm actually this is the second week in a row where we have a guy actually doing sensible stuff in the first three minutes which is just fantastic to see you know I almost feel like I need to speed this up a bit because this just looks so beautiful it's like there's no real point going over this because it's actually correct like he's he's doing the correct things he's following a build order he's making sensible moves look he doesn't lose his probe he has an adept for scouting a third He has a stalker for clearing this Overlord He's going to get a second Gateway a little bit too fast maybe Okay, there's some You're not supposed to get a probe cut at this point. That's not good. You're supposed to get a second Pylon before your second Gateway. That way it's easier to get a third unit and a second Oracle. But we can forgive all of those minor mistakes in the build order because the general idea here is just working for him. Know it's. Wow my god that's a Shield Battery oh no he's an idiot it's gonna be one of those games huh all right the reason you don't build a Shield Battery when you're playing Oracles because you have a freaking Oracle an Oracle kills everything you've seen a third base what are you gonna need a what are you going to need a Shield Battery for what's he going to build over three bases it's just going to be Lings it's worst case scenario it's Banelings and even then you're going to have two Oracles Oh my God I hate it and people will be like, \"oh, it's only 100 minerals\" In general, it's a good investment I don't care It's a bad investment It's not a good investment. You're wrong. You're not supposed to build a Shield Battery at this point You're supposed to be getting a faster third base and you're floating 400 minerals already Why is this Overlord not being cleared? The peeping Tom is in front of your window It is My boy, Basherslice here is a good. girl changing or a man changing can be either just coming out of the shower he looks out of his window and he sees a guy in a long letter coat you know one of those that goes all the way down to the legs camera in the hand and my boy basher slice you know what he does he just stands there you know it's like continuous with whatever it's doing now you could say oh that's not a bad that this fella is taking pictures and everything like bachelor's lies cover up close your window call the police in this case the police is this stalker they could just walk here and shoot the peeping tom like this is not what you're supposed to do my friend take out this Overlord why would you give someone free information when you can make them pay for it through an only fans account that's the real question i have here for you uh where different bors gizs said is quite the supply well 830 minerals third base is way too late should be going down generally not after 410 4 minutes and 10 seconds if you do it after 4 minutes and 10 seconds you've made a mistake already now i realize that you've made many mistakes in your life so this seems to just be adding on on top of a pile of why do you have two Shield Batteries you know a Shield Battery was wasted if it only uses too energy. If you can't even see that it used energy when you zoom in on it, there's two Shield Batteries What's wrong with you? It's such a terrible structure to build this fast To be fair, for me, it would be a mistake to build this Shield Battery But for my man, Batcher Slicer, it doesn't matter because he seems to be very happy with just having a 1K bank at all times A little bit of a buffer, you know? How anti-American of him We actually have some saving Thanks Huh Two Gateways going down, Robotics Facility Twilight Council He's absolutely lost Man, I can't believe how quickly this went from, man, this guy actually plays a build order. This is going to be great to him just throwing down all the buildings that he knows the names of in rapid succession Because he, for some reason, is incapable of taking extra base Like, literally what you can do. You can just move here with five units Okay, if there's 20 Lings, you can move here with three Adepts, two Oracles and a Probe And if he jumps on top of your Probe, you can kill eight Lings Like, if you activate the Oracles in time But instead, what my boy Bester Slice does, Bester Slice, yeah, Bester Slice. What my boy Bester Slice does over here is he just sits at home, you know, just sits here, just behind his batteries, behind his wall, gets a Prism. Eight Gateways is absolutely fantastic. The thought process, I'm not sure what he's thinking is like, oh, that's a lot of Lings. Like, opponent is 23 workers ahead right now. We do have some pretty decent production, I have to say, which is, I guess, something to have. Eight Gates, no tech, well, Charge's tech with no Forge. Nine more Drones for those. It sure everybody doesn't give a crap eater, by the way. Holy. It's two base. It's like, you know what? Probably is the right call here. I just add a Spore on my fourth base and get a couple more gases Overlord speed, Roach speed, Baneling speed, plus one, 74 drones, seems all right here It's literally up 30 workers Literally up 30 workers It's just absolutely amazing to watch The best part is there's going to be some guys in the comments going, I can't believe this is 4.4K Man, I I'm high gold and my game is way better than this I'm gonna have to break it to you guys, but your games don't look much better than this It's gonna be so much worse. This is the, it's absolutely the best part about reading the comments that the Is it Imba or do I suck? It's the guys, they're high silver and complaining about a Master 1 player suck He's like, man, this guy is so much worse than me I can't believe I'm stuck in silver one, loll All right, we have enough bashing on the lower leagues. We have a little move out here as Basherslis managed to take out this fourth now in theory this is something that looks quite nice right but this is the this is the tuned-up car without an engine move is what I call it it's like it's like the car that can make the that can go up and down you know to go where it's like real now's nice do you call it a body of a car I think so like a good a good car body like you know it's kind of gold or red it was it shiny no well cleaned and then you ask Basherslis hey Basherslis that's a good looking car man how fast does it go and it doesn't drive no engine no inside just all all outside and that's the same with this move he walks across the map kills the fort based and people go like wow man he denied the fort this game is looking tight and then you look back at what my boy Basherslis has and he has an army consisting of five Sentries barely getting 60 workers not a single attack upgrade and he's getting Storm which that's actually something i like i'm not sure why i was was hating on that and i do get Storm a lot as well i take back the hating on the Storm and i'd like to formally apologize to Basherslis and all other Protosses who might have thought for a second there that Storm was a bad Storm is always a good call Let's have a quick look at what my boy Basherslides doing here Just this scouting information at the nine minute mark So so far, Basherslice is aware that this base is being rebuilt In Bashers' mind, there is, well, this gas isn't even done yet for Bashar There's no gas here There's no gases here So right now Zerg is on three gas and on hatchery tech I doubt Bacher had the clarity of mine to click on one of the units, so it probably takes he's zero zero as well. Now in reality, we have a six gas, that's on Lair, has a Spire, two Evolution Chambers, which only one is being used, but I can't forgive him for that, a Roach Warren and a Baneling Nest, and Baneling speed done, and Roach speed done and someone with 198 capacity who's still building six more Overlords So if Pacheleslice was aware of this, he knew for sure to not target Overlords in the next fight But he also would know perhaps that's wise to build a couple of Phoenixes, perhaps a cannon here and there Now, this is always one of the key moments in a Protoss's life, is when Mutalisks fly in and you're not prepared This is where we separate the boys from the men. This is where we separate the GPL 2016 winners from the non-GPL 2016 winners. What is the reaction to the Mutalisk? It actually pulls away. That looks pretty decent here. Attacks across the map. And he's going for the Base Trade scenario. Now the beauty of the Base Trade is that it never works against Mutalisk if it's done like this. Like it only works if the Base Trade was a decision. This wasn't a decision. This was, oh crap, I'm out of position. I think I'm going to attack. Now I'm not saying that basher slide is necessarily going to lose, but I don't think he's winning either because he just lost every single gas unit he had in his army to four Banelings. And it's just absolutely great This also, by the way, was only six minutes Oh wow, the game's actually over Man, I thought it was going to be a real long replay Let me talk a bit more though So another thing I want to talk about is the, it's not just him losing everything for Banelings, but also six Mutas So this was six, I can count seven, seven Mutas This is what I call the, the Muta reaction that people always do is they see seven Mutas and they go, oh I can't believe he managed to get out 25 Mutas It's time for me to base trade because there's no way I can get on the air. Well, if you actually warp in four stalkers against this, you're probably going to be fine, and you can just play it out normally Because seven mutas actually isn't that much He still had a single phoenix as well, so four stalker and a phoenix can probably just push this away and probably give it some chase as well And then all you do is you clear this base, and then you piss off back home when you're on four bases and probably still at 65 workers But instead, he evacuates two bases completely because of seven mutas, then walks up around I can't want to see this one in slow motion again because this is one hell of a fight. Now let's count the Force Fields we have available here. All right. Wait, I need to open my thing for that. That is, oh, I can't see energy when I'm when I'm on bus. Okay, so this is about, well, that's four, four, eight, six, let's say 18 Force Fields. It's a rough estimation. He also, well, he used to have about maybe five Storms. Let's see exactly what he does with his spells here. Okay. Five Storms, I think it's, all right. Four Storms. Okay. Four Storms, 18 Force Fields. No five Storms. This guy comes in. Okay, so no Force Fields yet, no Force Fields yet, no Force Fields yet. No Force Fields. No Force Fields. No Force Fields. No Force Fields. No Force Fields. Storms. Pretty decent storms Doesn't really kill Okay Every spellcaster just died Well, well, Mr Bracterslice This ain't it, Chief This ain't it, Chief This ain't it It's time for your evaluation Now, you said MULEs were OP, but really your early game was absolutely terrible You were down 30 workers, was it? 44 to 74, right? Yeah, that was it At like the 6 minute mark, 6 40, 7 minute mark Not very good You didn't know harass at all with your Oracles You didn't manage to take a third Your build order made no sense Forge was too late Never did a single run by Scouting was atrocious I dislike your name I think it's not very good I'm sorry That's at home of them I'll take that back. Your name is nice. Your good boy. Your micro was terrible. car doesn't have an engine how you're gonna pick up any girls Banshee how you gonna do it you can't well no one can COVID and all um everything yeah and then you all completely overreacted to the mutas it was seven man it wasn't mess me that was seven mutas how can you lose that that's just impressive you're impressive at sucking because you suck all right that's going to be it for today's episode of Is it Imba or do i suck if you did like this don't forget to subscribe to my channel and if you didn't like this don't forget to support me on patreon twitter and twitch if you want to see more of this there's a video over here if you want to see my latest video which technically is this video so i'm going to put a link of this not just kidding yesterday's video is here and i'll see you all next time bye bye."

        "text": "Harsden, I used to suck, but thanks to your build order tutorials that is no longer the case I'm now a Diamond 3 Protoss player, MMR around 3 2K I attach a replay of a PVZ, where I dished out critical damage in the early game, killing my opponent's third, as well as his Lair I messed up the build a bit, it happens to the best, but clearly the damage was done regardless I then managed to defend his counterattack, destroying his entire army However, no matter how many times I killed my opponent's army, the Hydras just kept coming Zerg's ability to remix is Imba? Even after critical early game damage Best P.S. Terran tank pushes are Imba too. Even with your colossus opening, destroying Terrans, beating a Terran that builds tanks is near impossible. Okay. Well, so two claims, or the Terran tank push, I obviously can't help you with, but what's the other one? The remix The remax I think this is a common thing and a lot of people have been asking me, it's like, hey, what's up with the remix of the Zerg, man? It seems completely broken How is it possible to win? Well, we're going to have a look at that, won't we now, that word? We're going to have a look at that Thank you very much for sending in your replay. And the main claim we're going to be looking at here is indeed going to be the, is the remax? Nothing else Just not a specific unit He said the Hydra remax, but I think it's just the remax ability in general Like, he did critical damage in the early game, guys Not just regular damage I sometimes do regular damage I kill four or five workers with my Oracles, but my boy, that word here, he did critical damage Now, that's new That's very new, because I haven't seen that before Critical damage What does that look like? Critical damage is like when nothing else can happen anymore You know, if you're hunting for deer, Like the deer is just laying there You already shot it twice. All you need to do is finish it at that point. That's what critical damage is. I want to see how. What the hell is this build? Oh, he's playing Nexus first, full wall? That word. That word. That word. That word. Why would you do this to me? Not a full wall. I don't even mind the Nexus first, honestly. Just put this side row, one to the right side, one one little square to the right and you actually have a wall. What is this useful for? What is this good for my friend? Okay, we're going to see a Twilight Council I guess Adept, Adept Stalker. Okay, it's this Stalker. continuous work production at least so that's nice um yes two in Gas here i'm not sure if that's intentional i say usually that kind of stuff is intentional but with this guy i'm not too sure i'm i'm not too happy with how this is going already why is this first unit out of 324 even for a Nexus first that's late that's really late a Ling flood hits at this time i don't think you'd be able to hit with just a single Stalker mate So his opponent is going Roach for him at 3 40 Too far as opponent is probably just confused. How what the hell is this clown on? I have no clue either, uh, Pax I don't know either. So you see a third Gateway, Glaves, a Robotics Facility, and a fourth Gateway. Then we have a third gas. I think he might be playing a Glaive Adept drop. Huh. Well, this is one way to do it that I've never seen before and I hope I never will see again because if anyone actually watched my Glaive Adept video, just a little bit with any kind, you know, just slightly detail oriented. You might remember that I say that around 425 or 426. Whatever I say, is a good time to do your first warp in on the other side of the map with the Warp Prism. My man, Deadward doesn't even hasn't even started the Warp Prism yet. This guy's going to be so late. You know what Deadward? Deadward would do He'd had a wife, and they're expecting a kid His wife's in the hospital, and Deadwork is still at work You know, he's working, because they're not sure exactly when she's going to give birth He's like, you know, they don't want to miss it, but also, you know, I have an important deadline at work, and my boss has been a real real dick to me, ladies. What the hell is this? Are you ruining my analogy with more bad things? Just let me finish roasting you here So, wife's in the hospital and he's, you know, that word, you know, he has to, he has to work Then his wife was like, you really need to come right now. Like, it's going to happen within the next 30 minutes. And that was like, all right, I'm ready for it You know, I've been preparing for this all my life My man, that's word, you know, when he shows up. He shows up after his son graduates college That's how late that word is. That's how late this Warp Prism is deadward What the hell are you doing? Five minutes and ten seconds It's not even out yet? What the hell is wrong with you, bro? You have a kid, man Take some responsibility But no, you show up After he finishes college It's over now, man What did all that overtime get to you? It's a nice house, but you haven't even met your kid yet Pathetic. I kind of just want to ignore this Stargate, honestly Just pretend it didn't happen I feel like this game might have had some potential, but I feel like it just got thrown out of the window straight away All right. Let's have a look at the timing 5 40 41 Come on, man. Don't make me count Up to six minutes Oh! Warp Gate? All right At five minutes in 50 seconds My boy, Deadward, managed to get out six Adepts I get eight Adepts at four minutes and 22 seconds or 23 seconds these days Which means that Deadward is absolutely the slowest individual I've ever witnessed playing. On top of that, he's floating 2K resources at the 6 minute mark He has a full wall. The worst part is that the full wall is actually going to help him this game. I think there's nothing worse than watching people like Deadward And good things happen to them because they don't deserve it at all It's like when you're annoying neighbor who like cheats on his wife wins the lottery I remember John I remember Ella didn't deserve that And then he leaves with his new hot secretary to some island Tropical island. It's just insane That's what that word is doing here He's getting damage, but he doesn't deserve it. This guy doesn't deserve anything It really, really doesn't. Oh my god Just dancing the bouts This is floating 4K resources almost, man. It's seven minutes in the game. I didn't even know you mind that many resources in the first seven minutes in the game Like you're learning all these new things about Starcraft 2 that I really wish I didn't know because Ah, this is just so The DTs are doing great defense, honestly, but you killed what? You didn't kill the third base yet, but you killed 15 workers I mean, you're just up 20 workers And you have a bank account that Trump would be jealous of Like, holy crap, my dude. You have so much money How in the hell are you going to lose this game? Like, you could actually start a two-base carrier transition, while taking three bases at the same time and you'd still be floating 1k. Like this is not normal behavior man If you get this base, I'm actually gonna be upset If these three What are you doing, Pax? I know we're not allowed to flame the other guy, but what the hell? My boy deadward over here just Okay, gets a couple more cannons, which I guess isn't too bad It's just How is it possible that you're on four Gateways, a Robotics Facility, a Stargate, a Forge? You haven't used your Forge at all except for cannons You're not using your Robotics Facility whatsoever You just build Void Rays and warp in DTs on the other side Man, get a third base Get some Immortals out. Get like, okay, if your macro sucks, that's okay, but at least admit it, you know? Like, just admit it Like, you can build four more gateways or six more gateways if you have trouble spending your money You get your, you get your charge, you get your upgrades and everything Like, that's fine But you're pretending, like, you're having the pro gamer layout, you know I've seen Zest and Harsen play with four gateways and a robo and they don't float any money, so I should just copy that No, like, what you should be copying is our early game build order, but if you're floating 3K minerals at the 9 minute mark, you add 6Ks I don't give a crap, man. That's a good decision in your case. Like, that's going to help you spend your money. It's nice that you're doing damage, but, like the difference in income is all in your bank at this point. Like you could literally be at what like a hundred minerals is usually two supply so 2500 minerals would be 50 extra supply you could be up 30 supply right now and instead you're down 30-23. It's just impressive really. More cannons like I really quite don't know what to say here. You just keep doing the same thing over and over. More DTs, more Void Rays. And at this point, that you could even use this Warp Prism to put the probe over here and build a Nexus. That would fix so many issues. Just get your immortals, get further upgrades. You're getting storm? And single Stargate Void Ray. How about a couple of immortals, man? What's the APM like? What's the APM like? How do you have 250? Like what is happening right now that you're pressing 250 buttons at the same time? Let's have a look at his first person. Oh Void Ray, let me queue up two more. One more Zealot over here. Oh, pom-pom-pom-pom-pom. This is absolutely fantastic to watch. This is a man that has no sense of priority whatsoever. The only priority this guy in life is right-clicking spores. He just looks at it as well. He's just looking at his DTs do work. Like making sure that they still keep auto-attacking even if he isn't there He just literally looked at DTs Wait, is he He's just not doing anything He's looking around Two more pylons Here we go Finally some gateways He's a massive army in front of his base I don't understand why I suppose he keeps attacking as well Okay Shield Battery here would obviously be fantastic You know, that actually definitely would help We put it on one of the backward ones I guess it's not completely necessary Probably would have saved him two, maybe three void rays here Okay, so once again, a fantastic fight because Pax decided to make an attack that I'm not even sure of what that was exactly. Okay, so you completely slaughter an attack. You have 4K resources in the bank. You're sitting here. You're getting more Gateways. Do you have Charge yet? No, you do have Storm now. You've had a Forge for seven minutes now. You've had a Robotics Facility, which so far only built a single I think it built two Warp Prisms, no? I think you lost one. No, just a single Warp Prism, I'm sorry. It built a single Warp Prism this Robotics Facility did. And now we get plus one. Plus one air weapons is almost done. Dude, how about this? What? Man. Can you just do something normal for once in our life? Like, what's wrong with this or with this? These bases are fine. This is further away, harder to defend. I don't care if it's hidden or not Like you're light years ahead What does this have to do with his opponent's ability to remix? You're the kind of guy that joins a car race gets like you know you have the i think it's called the dakar rally or something going or the yeah the dakar rally where you you travel through the desert you know with your cars and it's a rough race it takes very long you're the guy that absolutely is like 10 hours ahead of everyone in this race right you're like you're just destroying the competition like literally 10 hours ahead. Then on the final day, when you're about to finish, what you decide to do is you go for a 25 hour nap After your 25 hour nap, you wake up and you're like, oh, everyone else finished Man, they must have had way better cars than me Like, it can be possible Like, I was so far ahead in the early parts of this race I don't understand how it's possible for me to even lose this Like, I just was way fast I'm like, mate, yes, you were faster at the start. They took a 25 hour nap like you've literally been doing nothing for the past five minutes like actually nothing I've seen sloths more active than you and that's impressive because I watched the documentary once about sloths in fact sloths are one of the most extreme animals on the planet and not just because they poop only once a week and these guys are really lazy so in the first part of the documentary like this sloth just forgets to join his family and then as a result he joins up a saber-tooth tiger and I think what's called a mammoth and they they travel they have to bring a baby back to its tribe is one of my favorite documentaries of all time was released on I think Pixar Disney can't quite remember it's really good documentary called called Ice Age if you haven't seen it but yeah so I know quite a bit about sloths and Jesus my boy you are so lazy, it's insane. You actually did manage to spend your money. You still have a million times better army than him. If you just hit any of your storms. What the hell was that? Can you get that in slow motion? Editor Man. Let's just have a Because Legends never die When the world was calling you Alright I'm gonna do it in slow motion As well I'll speak in slow motion Okay storm hits Two hydras And hits four zealots now three zealots 3DTs some of the Void Rays this storm hits nothing how is it even possible it's an instant cast spell my friend how can you hit nothing Alright I'm going to make a recommendation that I wouldn't make too many people but for you that work I don't think storm is the spell that you want to be using just perhaps the idea of the High Templars it should just be used for Archons for you, okay? I think anything that requires more than five brain cells should just be, you know, locked in the box for you. What? What was this? I mean, you win the fight once again, like don't get me wrong. It's absolutely impossible to lose these fights, even though my man, you're trying, you're trying your absolute best to lose these fights. Like, if this was, it was... If this was a broadcast of game, I knew you would be match fixing. Like, there would be no discussion. You'd be banned for life. Hey, this is not normal behavior. Once again, you're up 10 workers. You have a better army. I like that you go back. This is the first good move you do. And we've only been 16 minutes in, so that's pretty fast. Good, good, okay, that's a good Storm. That was a good Storm as well. So actually get some decent storms in. You're absolutely light years ahead again You have four base against, well, I guess three base Well, four base as well, but it's not mining. I mean, you're not really mining either, to be fair You decide to move out with a single Immortal, three Void Rays, and four Templar Then you don't cast storm. A couple of storms go down here Once again, good fight Just go back, remax. You have what? Seven Gateways Still haven't used your robo except for that one prism Might want to get a couple more Templar at this point as well and just really just produce anything at this point Getting some Probes, I do like that I wonder if you. We have an Immortal. You just forgot about it. That's nice. Casual scouting Void Ray. Who doesn't know it? I don't. I've never heard of the casual scouting Void Ray. Don't do it, please. This is just, I am just impressed, honestly. The level of play in this game by you, that word, is so low that I always wonder what happens below diamond. If this is diamond, then what's happening in the lower leagues? And do I really want to go there? I think I know the answer to these questions, and I don't think I want to go there. Now, you're actually getting a decent. What the hell? Single Stargate Carrier. I thought I'd seen it all, boys. The single Stargate Carrier. An all-time classic. Zealot, Void Ray, Archon, single Immortal, Templar, Carrier Map Control, zero Map Vision, zero Any idea of my opponent's tech? Zero Any idea of how many bases my opponent has? Zero Ways to detect my opponent's army Zero Brain cells, 3 On a good day maybe 4 for my boy Dadward here. Lose his fourth, but this is gonna be one hell of a recall, isn't it? Okay Actually was a nice recall That was a good recall I was gonna make fun of him because I thought he just was gonna reco. What? The hell Okay, let's look at this one again How does this even happen? First person deal First person view Take these guys haven't seen enough yet May they have 12 and 10 kills. These guys are veterans And this rookie just throws a Storm on them This, like, literally everything you've done so far in this game actually constitutes a negative micro I think almost every single fight would have been better with you just not doing anything Just aim moving in, closing your eyes, probably just walking away from your PC It's not like you do anything else Like, it's not like you macro behind this or you actually, you know, making progress in this game This is so insane You're actually, I'm not even sure if you're behind That's a thing. Reality doesn't mean much to me anymore at this point. If I was in this position, I probably feel ahead, but I've seen you in a position where you're up 20 supply and up 10 workers while floating 3K in the bank. And I still felt that you're just so far mentally behind that it doesn't really matter. So I, like I said, I think this position is okay for you. I just, I just think there are things wrong with you as a person that make this whole expedition a lot more painful than never should be. Two DTs, okay, we haven't seen those in a while. Maybe we could harass a bit with them, that would be cool. Good storms, very good storms. This was nice. Ooh, this was very good. Fantastic fight. Okay, like, how is it possible that sometimes you storm your own army and other times you actually storm the other race? It's good stuff, man. That was good. Good job. I feel like I'm kind of getting Stockholm Sintern. syndrome into giving him compliments you know he he's abducted me and forced me to watch this replay and in order to kind of bond with him and try to make him release me i just give him compliments and hope that that's going to help and that he won't send me anything anymore just kind of feel like giving this the Imba one you know so he just never emails me again he's like yeah mate this was completely broken this definitely looks too difficult to beat Living run by doing some damage Honor was like to play like this We have absolutely no goal in the game Just kind of sit there and stuff happens to you It's like the passive way to live life. Like never proactive about anything. I wasn't sick before this. I just started coughing randomly. I didn't know it's possible to actually get sick from watching this game. Like you're making me feel ill physically. I was gonna go for a run after this, but I don't think my legs will be able to move very far. I actually can't believe the things you're doing to me, man. It's really painful. I wonder if this constitutes some type of abuse or assault. Yeah, it's actually insane How little I want to go? Another first person shot here. Dum-bum, bum, bum Tim, couple more units. Dum-pum Maybe you get some vision now. Let me just Oh, plus three. Is he actually going to wait until he gets the money for plus three? I can't believe it. This guy's a legend Look, he just has this Cybernetics Core selected This is the beauty, I think, of the game at this level If you don't have the money for something, instead of coming back in 10 or 12 seconds, you just sit there and stare at the mineral counter until you have enough And he clicked the plus 3 upgrade, then you Chronoboosted once. It has nothing to do with Starcraft 2. This is a different game I don't know, I don't want to comment on the storms anymore But I keep beating a dead horse But that word keeps showing me the dead horse. Here where it is, man Here's a club, like just battered I don't want to Beaten this horse enough He's like, no, no, no It might look that, but you can keep going I don't want This army is so bad No, it's not true This army is good, but Okay, three Banelings would absolutely destroy this But if there's no Banelings, this army actually has some potential I'm just going to speed this up a bit My patience is ending I don't understand how that would actually manage to play this game if this is how it looks like for him Like, you send a run by or something at least. I think if all you care about this building stuff, you should be playing SimCity, my friend. Like roller coaster tycoon. The lion has escaped and then Deadward just gives up because it's too much effort. Starts a new zoo. No wait that's not the roller coaster game. That's Zoo Tycoon. Also used to play that. Fantastic games really. Spent way too much time with those when I was 7. Deadward never really grew out of them. 25, 26 year old man sitting here still playing zoo tycoon just with different skins. A couple of stalkers for diversity in his army. Oh, okay. He hits 200 and he moves out. Okay, we at least know his trigger now. We know his trigger. Now, this fight actually should be relatively easy. There's only Hydras and he has 12 High Templar and all of them have full energy. So all he needs to do is make sure he doesn't lose his entire army charging in and storm the Hydras. But what's going to happen is he's going to A move into this army with everything. And then once all the Zealots disappear, he's going to storm his own Void Rays and Dark Templar. Then he's going to lose those. Then he'll only have High Templar left. He'll still kill all of these Hydras. And then he'll lose to the Remax. And that's when he thinks he lost because of the Remax. This is going to be it, boys. I can feel it. Okay, show me those storms Okay, it's good storms Fantastic storms A couple more Can I get a couple more here? Well, good storm You know, actually not bad storms I'm not going to lie 3K in the bank, that's okay Oh, lose all his DTs because they're moving forward I think what that work needs is a slower army He needs his entire army to be the speed of High Templar So that when he's chasing an army, the High Templar can always storm Because he lost 80 supply of Zealots for no reason whatsoever, which is nice But also kind of bad So he killed absolutely everything He had the fight of a lifetime He's up like 10K in units lost. I have no clue how with his micro, but he managed to somehow do it, perhaps because his opponent decided to only build Hydras against 35 Templar with Storm. If Deadward goes back now, let's not forget, by the way, he didn't do a single macro action during this entire time. He fought for two minutes. He was busy looking at his army, guys. He's just going to sit back and macro up again, isn't he? I can feel it already. I still don't quite understand how he's going to be able to lose this game. Like his opponent literally only builds Hydras. And he has 4K in the bank. If Deadward wins this game and I just wasted 30 minutes of my life, I'm actually gonna flame him in some emails. And I'll record that process as well. I just can't understand how it's possible to lose this game. It seems not doable, right? Like this guy just keeps moving through storms as well. I guess the storm count is getting lower every time. And with the complete lack of macro on Deadward side, maybe it's possible. We have a run by, but there's three cannons. I wonder if Deadward actually ever looked at a replay. Just not this one, just in general. if he saw his mistakes then wonder if there's anything he can do to improve yes 3-3 upgrades he's gonna make fun of him for his crap upgrades to be fair if you only have plus 3 plus 3 at 30 minutes in the game while constantly floating 5K resources that is pretty crap he's gonna lose it he's gonna recall he's gonna recall to this base and he's gonna lose all of his High Templars to 5 Hydralisks is that what's gonna happen no warps and DTs instead I mean this replay has to come to an end at some point, right? I remember I thought that once before, then I was stuck in a 50 minute game. Between two guys that I don't think made it quite out of bronze too yet It's just Okay, we have an attack from that word now, he's the famous Zealots going forward move His only mining base has just been destroyed This one, okay, this one still is barely mining There's what? 14, 2,800 minerals there 2 times 1400 I did that very fast in my head If you guys were wondering how I calculated that so quick I impressed a lot of people with my quick maths like that I saw 700 on one patch Then I clicked the other, 700 there So the 2 times 700, that's 1400 because I know that 2 times 7 is 14 I have 2 zeros. Oh my God, are you joking? This is it. He A-moved his High Templar. He lost because he A-moved his High Templar. I actually cannot believe it. Please flame him, Tedric. Please just say something. Show me a sign point. Kind of validated Pax's play, though, which I'm not too happy about, because this guy literally only built Hydras and upgrades. Ooh, it's 20 High Templar. Ooh, let me get some more Hydras. Ooh, no, that didn't work. Let me try another time. Mm, more Hydras. But you know, at least Pax isn't a complete idiot. That seems to be reserved only for people that sent every place to me. In this case, Deadward. I am just going to scroll forward. I actually can't be bothered to watch him lose every single problem. He's actually going to stay in. He's actually going to wait for him. GG. It's over, guys. It's over. Holy crap, Deadward. What a train wreck of a game, my friend. Did you do critical damage? Yes. Yeah, you did critical damage. You killed him multiple times over. If this was a street fight, what happened here? Listen to this. A street fight with weapons. You had a knife. He had a knife. You stabbed him multiple times. He lost his knife. He was on the floor. He can't move anymore. He can't do anything. Except beg for mercy. You stood there with a knife, claiming victory already. Then as you try to stab him, you fall over accidentally cut off your left arm, your left leg, and step your big toe on your right foot. Rookie mistake, you might say. That's correct. Then, to continue the street fight analogy, you're still fine because you still have one arm and you still have one leg where only the big toe has gone missing. You decide for fun to stab your own stomach a couple of times, that you're losing the char slots. The analogy stops here. My main point is that everything you did this game was terrible. Your build order was literally a minute and a half, two minutes late. You floated money like your life depended on it. Like my friend, like he's going to do banking or something, save some cash I absolutely no clue what you were doing there It's just impressive No map vision ever You had zero harass You didn't even know he had a Lair, I think The only reason you know that there was because this guy literally only built Hydras I don't think you build an Observer to clear Creep Maybe you did I can't remember Your Storms were something else It was actually terrible It hurt me to watch You killed more of your own units than his at some points Honestly, mate The ability to remix of Zerg is strong I can give you that Like Roaches and Hydras They can come out fast. But you were so bad this game that you should actually never be allowed to complain ever again about anything in your life. You've been banned from complaining. I, you suck. You suck so hard, dude. You are so bad. Honestly, this is terrible. You suck. You, like, really, just really suck. I'm sorry, dude. Yeah I don't know guys, I don't know why they keep sending them to me. Why do they do it? If you like this, don't forget subscribe to my channel. More of this is over here. My latest video on the other side. I also have some socials up there. So if you want to follow that, check that out. That's all cool. Love you all. See you all next time. Bye bye."

They seemingly outrange all ground units. And since they're always accompanied by Hydras, any air units I manage to fart out get ruined before I can get a decent count. Clearly, I am not the problem, as I have literally perfect macro. I am a macro god. That's why I have achieved the pinnacle of Platinum League. So is it Imba, obviously, or do I suck? Impossible. I am a god. Cheers, Jack Send from mail for Windows 10. I don't know why, but for some reason that makes me smile. If you're too dumb to remove the send from Windows email 10, I feel like it's going to be hard to take you seriously But, uh, quick note, to my editor, the name Jack the Funk is going to turn into either macro god or literal macro god You can have your decision there Then we can continue into this game So first claim, well the only claim really he makes about his own place that he's a literal macro god We're of course going to have a look at it What the hell is this? Oh, this is pig Nice Beautiful Let's have a look Alright, let's see what this fella is doing It's a decent time Use diamond three Diamond three. I say this because people in my, in the YouTube comments are always very mean to everyone. I'm gold three. I'm better than this. No, you're not. No, you're not. All right, Stargate coming down. Pretty standard timing, perhaps a bit late. You can see a second Adept warpgate on the way it's all looking okay. I don't mind this build order so far. This is looking pretty tight now from the Zerg perspective. Just standard ling openers this is a this what I call a flat wall now the problem with flat walls is actually a pretty big one because you need two structures especially if your Pylon's placed over here to wall this this little place. You need a Pylon here and a Pylon here. That's why you always want to stagger the wall. Is that what you call it? Make it like a stairs. You want to be able to have like a bit of a dent. So put this Gateway one block to the right or put this one one to the right. That way it's very easy to wall with a single building. Helps a lot. Now, Phoenix first. A little bit of Chrono Boost not being used. A little bit of Probes not being used. probes not being created but all of these things you know we can we can live with I don't care too much about them I'm not gonna you know I'm not gonna complain about this kind of stuff anymore you know we've we've heard it all we've heard oh no you forgot to go probes for three seconds and no one cares what the hell is this though oh you've got a third Pylon oh no okay so if you forget the third Pylon that's okay but you just cancel your units like it's bad to not have a third Adept than it has to not have any pro production for three minutes or well in this case 30 seconds okay bad start he also takes his extra gases before he takes the Nexus i'm not a fan of that i think it sucks he plays Phoenix Oracle which i also think sucks he should play at least two Oracles before he gets any type of extra attack like the difference between one Oracle and two Oracle is so big that it almost feels criminal to not build a second Oracle because list it is if you go from one Oracle to two Oracles you increase your efficiency or your yeah your effectiveness by 50% because what first by a hundred percent if first you need one shot two shots now you only need one so you increase efficiency by a hundred percent no you decrease the time spent by 50 percent so at first you spend two seconds now you would spend one no so then you increase efficiency by a hundred percent you see guys I did finish my math courses good so yeah this is why you get two Oracles always because it's very good you can just pop pop pop drones really easily it's very nice don't want to be the guy with a single Oracle see you got zero kills that's typical of a single Oracle absolute loser it's a nice animation he has there I saw holy crap no um now what else are we doing here mr Jack the Funk so far you haven't really been too busy but you did get a Forge and twilight I like that you're scouting this general area so in case there any type of Nydus Worm over here that would be very easily spotted which i'm a big fan of honestly i think it's good to have this kind of stuff prepared you know he's just thinking about the niche attacks that his opponent can can throw out him now four Adepts are going to move across the map and the thing you want to do with four Adepts is usually you want to use them in unison with your Oracles so you can either clear creep or maybe you can even try to go for some drones but usually you split them up to two but I guess this also seems to work another quick trick with Adept is try to move into these mineral patches so that this kind of surround can't happen as quickly but once again this all seems pretty reasonable so far this I mean these are decent shades for getting some damage done with these Adepts this is what eight workers going down now there is a classic thing here where Usually when a player below Masters 1 is doing things that isn't macro, it's usually worse than if he would have actually macroed. Now, I'd like you guys to think back off about a minute ago when these four bad boys shaded in And I'm going to assure you that he probably was at 50 workers, or 49 or something like that Probably one more worker finished up He hasn't made a single macro action He's floating 2K resources And he didn't produce a single Probe So even though he killed 16 workers, even though I don't think there was all of it with just the four Adepts, maybe he had some before No, wait, he didn't because his Oracle was completely useless Yeah, so it must have been just these Adepts I still feel like his position in the game didn't improve very much. Because he just kept floating money, didn't build any workers for himself. So you see, he's still down 10 workers, which is impressive. Also getting your gases down at 7 minutes and 40 seconds is almost 2 minutes later than I usually get them, which is also impressive. So so far our literal macro god is about 2 minutes behind in an 8 minute game. And that is 25% Unless you calculate from the 6 minute to the 8, then he's down by 33% See how it works? percentages are a very wild thing. Did I just hear a Robotics Bay being queued up? Alright, all right, all right, all right, all right I thought we were gonna have one hell of a game, but I guess not. So he's gonna get a storm, second Robo, Robotics Bay, without mining any gas on his third. I have no clue how this is gonna pan out. But I'm a fan already. I am definitely a fan. The problem with getting this Yeah, throw the Dark Shrine down as well. I mean, we have plenty of gas anyway, right? Jeez. How is he gonna be able to pay for this expensive habit of just buying everything with gas? Like the type of guy that has seven credit cards maxed out, gets called by his bankers like, I made you have seven credit cards max out. That's annoying, but could I get an eighth card? Because I feel like I really need that Dark Shrine right now in my life. Like, I really feel a strong connection as I'm a, what I called? Gemini. The astrology signs. I feel like people that max out more than seven credit cards usually are into astrology. I think you have to be a special kind of stupid. Actually, that's such a Leo thing to do. No, that's not a Leo thing to do. Stupid Gemini's. Where else? Ah, Colossus. 1400 minerals, 200 gas. He's going to be able to work in a Dark Templar, like a single one or something. And the rest of his army is just going to be pure Zealot. So you can actually afford a lot of gas units out of special structures The problem with that, is that it just leaves you with such a big Zealot army that you're just going to die the moment your opponent has two or three Banelings this actually is a very good army though against anything that isn't Banelings which at this level it seems like people don't really make Banelings which would explain the by a little lower plat lower lower lower what was that You heard about stutter stepping once? Let's have another look at this stutter step. What the hell? So the reason why people stutter step is because you want to get in range of your opponent, or when you're chasing, or when you're running away, right? You stutter step, you shoot while running away, so you still do some damage, but you also get away from your opponent. This is anti-stutter stepping. This makes sure that your opponent doesn't need to have. Look at this. What was this move? It's like, oh, you can't reach the Immortals on the back yet. Let me just move a bit quicker. Closer. That's fantastic. That's a good move. I completely lost my train of thought. I write the low-level dudes Because no one builds Banelings. Stuff like Immortals and Colossi are really broken in this, usually in this league or in this player bracket I don't know how you want to call it. This guy's just actually just maxing Roaches I don't quite see how Jack the funk here is gonna lose this game but usually these guys manage to find ways that I haven't even thought of so even just speculating would be kind of ruining part of the fun. Now imagine there was a Warp Prism with this right and What? What the hell was that? So this was what? 20, 24 Roaches, maybe? Okay, it says 41, but a lot of them weren't there. I think that was 24 Roaches There was freaking five Immortals in the Colossus there. I think he could have just fought that fight. He just moved commanded away. He lost like five, six units. And now it's like, again, now that I've recalled, I can go again. That's not quite how this game works. Like he probably could have already filed before. This is absolutely wild. Fourth base goes down. I mean, that's a big road to run by. Zerg is expanding like his life depends on it, though. Now going into Lurkers. Kind of like it. I think that's kind of cool. You know what? I think that is kind of cool. Gets to two upgrades. It's funny because Jack the Funk thinks he's a literal macro god. Meanwhile, he's been floating at least 2. 5K resources consistently since minute 7 But this Zerg has actually been expanding absolutely everywhere You know, he's even as a base down here He's trying to creep spread He's just playing very basic units and just focusing on macroing You know, he's getting his injects done He has larvae everywhere He has a lot of money in the bank because he's been mining so well He does a run by here and there, but there's nothing fancy in his play style You know, it's just good old solid Roach Hydra And sure, it's not the best play style And sure, there's no Banelings And yeah, the creep spread could be better But he actually has a, you know, it's not a bad style It's, it's solid. You know, he's a lot of money. He's working on his macro. I like it. I feel like the actual literal macro god here is Protoss. And our boy Jack the Funk here is not doing Okay, here come the Lurkers. Now, this is a key moment in our literal macro god's life. Because this is where stuff starts to go wrong for him, or at least where he believed stuff starts to go wrong for him. In my mind, stuff has been going wrong in his life for a while in order for him to even get to this point. Sending a replay complaining about Lurkers while you're Diamond 3 and constantly floating 2K resources. Maybe he doesn't have the A move button. like bind, bounded, bind it or something Like, make your armies like five times the size Just fight! How can one guy be this bad at judging fights? So right now he has 34 workers, our literal god He's still floating 1,800 minerals though Does he not realize he can just a-move this army? He has six Immortals Like, I know going down ramps is not the way to go, but I think even going down this ramp, he would be able to win He's been able to win for the past five minutes by just a-moving, I feel like And instead he moves commands around, loses seven more Immortals, and then decides, oh, I just lost seven Immortals. I probably can't fight this. It's not because your army sucks because you keep movement-commending around. This is painful to watch, honestly. I mean, this army is complete garbage at this point. There's seven Lurkers. There's nine Immortals, dude. And there's two Colossi. There's storms available. Circuit's floating like madman as well. Holy crap. No fourth base on the way, 47 workers again though. No gas being mined. Our literal god hasn't probably looked at his base in the past five minutes. He's just going to A-move across the map with a massive Immortal army. No, he's not going to A-move. If he would be A-moving across the map, he probably would just be winning. He's going to be doing something dumber. It's working a couple of Zealots to deal with the threat of Zerglings With no adrenal glands yet, so Zerglings can actually be beaten at this point Oh, all right Now what we do here, Jack, this is We regroup We get an Observer with our army, if we don't yet Okay, we do And we make sure that our whole army is together when we attack a base, okay? And then whenever this guy comes to defend, we kill him Another point of contention, by the way, is the complete lack of upgrades here for Jack, who's on plus one. our macro god who has been floating money since minute six, minute seven, who has the money for two extra Oracles, but can't afford a +2 upgrade Observer speed. So his Observer can fly into Spore Crawlers faster or into Overseer ranges. I feel like he's also F2 in his life away, isn't he? Dude, just go and fight for once in your life. You can clear the rocks as well. You don't have to walk down only this ramp. You can also go through the middle, man. How is it possible that you can do absolutely nothing in a game when your army is lose the Observer. Oh, Jesus. He's getting a Fleet Beacon on three bases. He actually got every single tech structure on three bases. He's not even mining gas. How is it even possible that his main base is not mining gas properly? And now his natural is. Oh my god. The macro god does it again. I get it. What are these DTs doing? He's actually gonna move down. He could have. I wouldn't even mind it. He really could have. Does he have blink? No, he doesn't have blink. Our literal macro god on three bases. With two K minerals in the bank. How do you even get two K minerals? He gets 1,100 minerals a minute. That means if he doesn't do anything for two minutes, macro wise, that's how he gets a big bank. Which literally you could spend 1200 minerals by building by like one warpin cycle. One warpin cycle is done within like two seconds. You can't even spare two seconds to macro. What are you doing dude? Move command into move command. I feel like he hasn't actually fought. Look, this is Immortals and Colossi are fantastic units, right? But they're mainly good at fighting. Like, really. Their strength is their power in straight-up engagements. Running away isn't their main strength. They're not French built. This is like investing, imagine you're a country. Imagine you're a country, you are Belgium. Imagine you're from Belgium. And you invest, as the government, you invest a lot of money into a tank. Now this Siege Tank is a great, is a great stationary tool You know, you can siege it up It has great tons of damage It has long range It can shoot It can do basically anything It's the ultimate unit Then when you're in a fight, you decide to just run away with all your Siege Tanks And then the commanders go like a ball like this Siege Tank is you know it has no speed You know, we have to push it or like it's being pulled by gorillas, you know? Like this is a stationary thing that does the most damage of standing still And they're like no, no, no, I feel like we should be sending these guys back, you know, back, back, back. Back to the capital just to make sure like now, sir, we have a good position here We're outsizing our opponent's army about 15 times Really, it's just one guy on a horse I feel like we should keep this position But instead, what you do is you run your 15 Siege Tanks back, or while they're being pulled by Zealots, they're being pulled back, while the guy on the horse with his bow and arrow is slowly but surely whittling away on him That is kind of what this game feels like You've had the absolute best army in the world against what he could have This is the meme with the guy that puts the stick in between his wheels, you know. He's like, \"Ah, fucking lurkers, man.\" He's like, \"Dude, it's not the lurkers. Like it's... It's you. Why would you use the gorillas to run back? You have the best stationary siege tank in the world.\" I'm just gonna have a conversation here? This is not what I signed up for. This is the ultimate circle jerk. Two guys in Diamond Three talking about how much lurkers are broken. I tried with the DTs. Ha ha ha ha ha. Oh no. All right. Our literal world, my friend. I'm sure you meant well. Well, I'm sure you meant well. The problem is you had no macro. You're honestly, everything you did was terrible from your macro. The first four minutes were tight, except the supply block. You forgot your third pilot. We'll forget about that. Okay. But the first four minutes were tight, minus the supply block. Then you went into double robo, immortal colossus, storm, Dark Templar, Stargate, Fleet Beacon. You had everything. Like, just try to go with a unit composition and stick with it. We have a unit composition called Charge Immortal Archon. This unit composition is absolute king, my friend. Like they beat everything on the ground. We can storm. We can run in with Immortals. We can A move. It's like a little party just by itself. And here you are with your 17 different tech structures. No, man. We run by with zealots and we just kill the rest of their army. What immortal charge Archon? That's the way it is That's the way it's going to be even if we think of if we don't think about your army composition we just look at how good your army was and how you handled that army like the amount of it started with the move command into the roaches like you won that fight but it still made me angry then you had a move command away into a recall from 20 roaches while you had six immortals with with plus one um you stopped upgrades completely the one thing you should have been investing your gas in is definitely upgrades You tried getting a Fourth Base once After it got cancelled once Well, never mind It's not possible, guys. Like, I actually can't do it. It's too much for me. This is the kind of people that attempt to go, not even a marathon. I was going to say a Marathon. I was going to be nice to you. But taking a fourth base is not like a Marathon. Taking a fourth base is more like going for a 5K run. You know, the first run you're going to do. And there's these people, they go like, \"I'm going to go on a run.\" And then they can't find their shoes. And it's like, \"I can't find my shoes. Like, how am I going to go on a run? You know, no shoes. I can't run.\" This is just logic. You know, they call their, their husband or their, their wife. And they go like, no shoes, no run. The husband's enabler, of course. Of course an enabler goes like, yeah, no shoes. Can't run. Back on the couch. Just like that. No running for you. That's what you did with the fourth base. I'm not sure who your enabler is. maybe you should visit a therapist for that couple counseling might be useful there but yeah it's uh it's rough man i can't remember where i was going with this um to cut things short really terrible unit composition terrible unit movement no micro negative decision making negative IQ decision making I have to I have to say and then at the end you complain which shows a weak mindset a bad brain and just poor personality trade in general we can zip it up here boys you suck you suck very very hard all right thank you everyone for watching for this amazing episode of is it Imba or do I suck?

        "text": "Dear Harsdom, I'm a huge fan of your Imba series I think I did everything I could, but I still lost this game Protoss is just broken My opening build did not work well, but I took out Protoss' third base in the midgame However, the opponent produced Zealots like they were free, and DTs were like harvest knives reaping my bio Even though I used EMP to counter them, the disruptors beat the crap out of me I think I am like a desperate marine nailed in the coffee nailed in the coffin and six salads are doing the coffin dance Best wishes, vegetable Alright, vegetable. We are about to find out what type of vegetable there are, whether you are a carrot, a tier a vegetable, or something similar to a tomato, which is a lower tier vegetable. Some people even consider it a fruit. And everyone knows that fruits are worse than vegetables. Let's have a look to see if Zealots are Imba, if High Templars are Imba and if Disruptors really beat the crap out of you. Or perhaps it might have to do something with your scale level. So let's start where we always start and that is the build order. Or well, this, this thing. So he opens with a full wall. This is a little trick that a lot of the Terrans have been using. where you fool well and it's very difficult for Protoss to kind of figure out what's going on, you know? That's nice I don't mind that. Now, one of the things that it's nice about is that you can get a pretty fast factory, and the timing of the factory there becomes pretty important. So you want to get the factory down ASAP. I know I skip back into the replay, but just to show you guys that he had a decent amount of gas stacked up before he built a factory. That's not quite what you want to be doing. He had 34 gas. So not too tight there in the builder, my friend. You gotta really, when you play a builder like this, tightness of timing is absolutely everything. And well, you were about as tight as the face of a 55 year old Unless they use Botox, most of the time, that's a little loose Sorry for all the 55 year olds out watching. Shout out to you. My boy vegetable going back with that SCV now as well And okay, he's probably gonna Proxy Starport Okay, it's an interesting path he's taking Okay, yeah, here we go Factory hasn't finished yet, so the Proxy Starport is most likely going to be in time Reaper goes across the map Oh, it's not going to pull the casually explained there and just pops into the main base. You want to get a scout on what kind of type of attacker is, maybe get one or two Probes. So this is all looking pretty fine right now. Proxy Starport with Triple Hellion. Honestly, this is, I'm liking this. I'm liking this as a start for our boy vegetable here. He's looking damn fine. This is some eggplant level decisions here. My vegetable man. Two gateways from the Protoss, well, let's just say that this Protoss is lucky that he isn't the one that's sent in the replay because I'd have a thing or two to say about him. Now, the one thing that always bothers me whenever people play this type of build order, is that they don't actually know how many resources they need at all. Like, they just, what is this? Supply block into the double Medivac queue. I was like, hey, I was going to complain about his resources, and he realized that I was like, let me just queue up to Medivacs, so it looks like I actually macroed well. So whenever people do aggressive builds that open two gas, they never think of how many workers they need to put in gas. Sometimes it's fine that after you start your first Factory, you don't need to keep three, three workers. Just pull out two workers, get a little more minerals so you can afford a faster Command Center. Because in this case, he's floating, that lets me well here, he's loading 320 gas, which that could have been minerals and it could have been basically a Command Center at this point, or could have been pretty close to a Command Center. So just something to keep in mind their vegetable, but you know, I'm not going to blame you too much for that. So far, it's, you know, it's almost a build order. I've seen worse. I've seen a lot better, but I've also seen worse, which we're focusing with positives. I'm a change man. I went on a small holiday. I came back, refresh. I'm like, I don't want to be the same old negative guy, you know, just complains about everything. I'm relaxed, I'm calm. I have a high tolerance for crap, like the things you're pooling here right now. So let's see how long I will last. First, matter of fact, is about to pop out. One of the many things you want to do, of course, is that whenever your Medivac pops out, you want to have it lined up with your three Hellions being there. So your timing is tight, right? You want to be able to drop into the main base as soon as possible with three Hellions. Now, a funny thing about this build order is that I faced this build order before with the no CC. And I know the fastest timing at which it can hit. The fastest timing at which it can hit is three minutes and 34 seconds. Our friend vegetable here is hitting a full minute too late. No, that's not true. Only hits 57 seconds too late. That is honestly not that bad. I lied there with a minute. Only 57 seconds, but that's okay. As you can see, instead of there only being three units, right now there's, well, closer to what seems like Why can't I count? Eight units. Six Stalkers and two Sentries. Eight units. So that's about a five unit difference, which you know that usually whenever you do a timing attack. One of the most important things of the timing attack is to actually hit at a timing. It's kind of in the word there where if you're just randomly attacking at you know at any given time. It's not really a timing anymore. It's just a move out. What [player] did here was a move out. He moved out without there really being any sense of timing. He's been behind in income for quite some time or at least behind in worker count. It's not behind income at the moment because the Probes all retreated to the main, but he should be behind income. His CC is very late and his follow-up is, well, I maybe it's fine, like getting two rax is fine The problem is his CC is just very late, so his Eco kind of sucks No Engineering Bay yet either, so upgrades are not really going to be a thing so far in this game for our boy, Vegetable and he's still just down 11 workers He killed three workers And I have a feeling that two of those workers killed were with a Reaper So basically what Vegetable did, he delayed his CC by three minutes to throw away three Hellions into eight Gateway units That is the state of the game so far. So could we consider this as vegetable out playing his opponent? bonus so far? No, not really I don't think that would be a fair characterization of this game so far I think Vegetable has been making some mistakes in the build order He's been making some mistakes in the control of the drop and he's been making some mistakes in his follow-up as well I guess that kind of counts as the build order But, you know, we're still in a good mood The holiday spirit is high and maybe he can redeem himself. You know, a couple of good drops, a couple of nice move outs here and we're all gonna be fine mr vegetable we're all gonna be fine no i won't even blame you for what happened in the early game if from now on you start playing very well we get an Engineering Bay starting to get upgrades you know i'm seeing this game with rose tinted glasses you know it's everything's looking pretty everything is looking beautiful double fortune the other guy's actually playing pretty well i didn't like his opener very much but he's doing some solid moves man a little bit of Chrono Boost saving But you never know when you're going to need it So, just saving for the Great Depression. Here's our boy vegetable He's starting to macro up as well You know, he's producing some workers again This game definitely has some potential A couple of Medivacs will be used to, and we're going to have a move out I guess when stimming combat finishes and two more Medivacs, something like that Now, the thing you want to do as a Terran, um, First of all, you want to get your Medivacs, basically the moment your Starport is ready So you can, even if your Stim and Combat isn't finished, you can start moving out a bit You can start pushing for it and push these Stalkers back a bit. Because most of the time there's going to be blink, right? And in that case, you do want to be pushing that back. Another thing you can do to keep Stalkers at home is to send the Raven like this. So you just go to the right side and you start harassing a bit with a Raven. Or you send it over here. You start harassing it. and you fly it into the mountain and from the mountain you can put a turret here you can put a turret here you can put a turret here the first a lot of units to be left behind now if any race is broken here boys what is this he's gonna pull as SCVs oh no vegetabla you gotta be kidding this also is a classic move by the way just imagine the mental gymnastics of this one It's like let me build a third Command Center and then pull all the workers on my natural It's like the this is the triple MULE mindset is what I call it is where you just build a Command Center to throw down some MULEs I'm absolutely loving this. He didn't even pull all of his SCVs. He just put like like 10 you know doesn't even the balls to really commit. Ah that's so sad. It's like mate you've been together with your girlfriend for five years now. Maybe it's time, you know know maybe it's time to really commit but no you keep talking to your side piece you know just making sure to have to have something in case it goes what no just commit for once in your life to something vegetable. What is this you can just walk on the map with 12 SCVs for for a minute and a half chasing back to Blink Stalkers it'll happen with the Raven. I love this he really has commitment issues I think. Oh man, glad I'm with his girlfriend or boyfriend That'd be messed up. That would truly be messed up. Honestly, a supply isn't even a bad, but it's because our Protoss friend is floating 2K minerals Three tanks are in a good position This is a beautiful stim Now this is what I want to see on close This is the Templar, you know? I feel like this Templar might be a key factor in this game I just have a weird feeling that our boy vegetable might have some trouble my own. No, this is looking good. What the hell? This is a good job so far, vegetable He only has a single upgrade and sure as a Protoss is throwing some money. Vegetable only has 45 SCVs and rallying Liberators across the map in some weird attempt to siege this third. But I mean his micro against Storm has been absolutely a class so far as in that the single Storm tick has hit anything. And this Nexus is falling quick. Man, our boy vegetable with the commitment issues here is making some real plays. With the classic icy storm so I'm not going to send any units forward at all. I love it when Terran. This is so cool. Okay, look at this, look at this move. So what he's doing, he's pre-splitting his units in a good way, right? But because he's a Terran player, the only hotkey he uses is F2. So whenever he actually starts moving forward, the pre-split is going to be useless again. This is really a classic. Actually, it doesn't do it this Tank. That's a bit sad. I can't believe I pass for that. A couple of storms on all of the Tanks together, but honestly not the worst fight. Man, this guy really is proving me wrong in every possible way. Vegetable. He's pre-splitting and leaving the pre-splits. He's pretty much won this game honestly. I don't. Like his opponent still has 3K in the bank because he forgot the macro for the past 5 minutes. How many Gateways does he have? 8 Gateways. He should be able to produce stuff. And he literally has no units. It's like 6 High Templar, 6 Stalkers, and 7 Zealots. So what you do in this case is you send your Marauders forward. You right-click this base and you win the game. Yeah, just like that. And then you can send a couple of Marauders for it to kill these. Did he send a replay in which he wins? That would be so sick and a massive waste of my time. Writes the juicy description. And he's absolutely stompch his opponent. He even has more money at this point. He's still not really transitioning when he's getting plus one, plus one armor. I'm sure the macro isn't looking too hot and sure The worker production stopped at the five minute mark. These are all things we can complain about, but at the end of the day, a win is a win, you know, it doesn't really matter how you get it. If your macro sucks and you don't get upgrades, your unit control is mediocre, and you don't have any worker production, that all might sound bad. I mean, if you win, you win. A perfect drop as well into the main base. Hello, how about we unload everything? No? Okay, yeah, there. I actually have no clue how vegetable is gonna lose this. Even though this fight wasn't insanely good, it still was good enough because, I mean, vegetable has 2K minerals, well, 1 7K minerals at this point. He has pretty decent production and he has four, you should have five rax, right? Yeah, there's five rax He has a Starport He can build Tanks He can go into two two All he really needs to do at this point is spend his money, get his gas production going I mean there's gas mining going There's one really no gas money over there Fourth base. I'm not a big fan of that, but the problem really is that he's only building three units at a time even though he has five Barracks and a Factory which usually if you kill a third base of your opponent and take a decent fight it's wise to try to spend all your money no Armory no second Engineering Bay these are also mistakes the longer the game goes and your own low upgrades that usually kind of sucks for you. There is no big Ghost Enhanced Shockwave it's called actually the proper name for it let's use it for one. The big Ghost thing actually actually EMPs everything the perfect play so now something that sounds very tempting here for vegetable is to chase this army as you've just gotten basically perfect EMPs and it makes some sense i don't have too many issues with it the only issue i have I have it is that his army actually isn't that big because right now he's slowly 4. 2k resources He actually is gonna do well for a bit but in the end he's gonna get blasted I mean there's plus two armor but what was this complaint about? He complained about Zealots and High Templars He's losing the game to Archons and Stalkers even though in theory the Archons did come from High Templars I was believing that storm was going to be the the broken factor, you know, but in reality the real issue here is the 3 5k minerals in the bank I always like to translate minerals into supply and the easiest way to do it is to pick Marines, obviously Marine is 50 minerals and one supply So if you think of a 2. 5k bank, that would be 50 supply that you could have added in pure Marine Isn't that great how that works? 5 supply? Yeah that's correct So basically our boy vegetable should be at around 150 supply right now or well 160, 170 supply On top of that, he's finally getting his 2-2 actually, which is good He's getting a fourth base Like the production tab is looking a little healthier now, but I still feel like his production overall has been lacking a little bit I wouldn't mind him adding a tank here and there, just to spend some of his money, or even just to go back in, or to go into Widow Mine production. I won't say go back, but you can only go back into some type of production if you've done it before, and he definitely didn't produce Widow Mines before. Now, his upgrades and everything are quite late. He's a bit oversaturated on the third, but that shouldn't really ruin the party. He scans forward. I mean, Enhanced Shockwave is done. So at this point I feel like once again we're in this situation where Fetual is really really in a nice spot. I feel like he's been in a nice spot for the past five minutes. He's even produced some workers. He's transferring them now like he's kind of looking healthy. Honestly is it? The good old Medivac rally across the map. It's also really a classic. The Flanking Ghost with two more Medivacs So you would think if he hits this EMP once again, that that would be good enough I think it might Ah What are the upgrades? 3-2 against 1-1 So our boy fetched oil here hitting just before his own 2-2 finishes against the 3-2 army. Now, if we put some quick math onto the case here, we see that 3-2 against 1-1, that is, a three upgrade lead yes that's a three upgrade lead. For a Protoss player in a situation where the army supply was even so even if you hit the perfect EMP the fight still is gonna go terrible. On top of that our boy vegetable still floating like he's saving for the next financial crisis. It is not looking to get my boy vegetable this is not looking too good at all here my friend. I mean You really did try hard, I believe him, you know. The reason I knew that he was trying so hard was because he was only focusing on one thing and I was moving around with his army At the start he was so focused on executing the build order, he kind of forgot to hit the timing Yeah, you sometimes just have that, you know? Whereas like, man, I really want to execute this build order And then you're so tunnel vision on this building things that you completely forget to actually line up things like Hellions moving out for the for the Medivac, your factory, you're a factory when you get a hundred gas You focus so much that you don't see the goal anymore That's kind of what happened here with vegetables. You know, we give him an A for effort so far, but the execution has been lacking. The execution has been lacking. I was going into my end game rent, but it seems like this game just never ends. That's nice. It's a bit like life. Just keeps going on and on. Absolutely beautiful. 157 supply against 117. I mean, I feel like our boy vegetable still actually has a chance. This is the thing that always sticks me off. Whenever I do any of these replays, it doesn't even matter what, honestly. Whenever I do one of these replays, I just look at it and go, at this point, you could give this to a player with a brain, and he'd probably still be able to win. And it doesn't even matter what league the player with the brain the player with the brain is I know for a fact there's 50 guys in the comments right now that are going, man, I'm, I'm bronze seven and I would definitely be able to win this situation He didn't hit a single EMP, he's floating constantly 5K minerals I agree with the guys in the comments, man These guys are definitely right This is a sick drop This is going to be the first successful multitask that we're going to see from vegetable Now we're going to follow these two Medivacs because this is really exciting We've seen him attempt two drops before, one over Actually no, he did a drop in the main base, but that wasn't a multitask. That was just a complete army drop. Let's see what these two Medivacs are going to do. We're not going to pay attention at all to the fight. We're just going to look at these drops. This is the multitask that Terrans are so well known for. Look at these guys. This is really always one of the key things. Do you remember? Yes, he does. That's beautiful. We actually think some multitask, man. Every time I'm about to make fun of him for something, he actually does it well. This guy is absolutely ruining my show. Oh, drop actually does a lot of damage. Pretty proud of that. It's not even really pretty. Some first person view here. Picks up the Medivac, flies away. Who? She's a single zealot, moves there with his in a single zealot, moves there with his in a very entire army, sensible, sensible. 12 DTs move in. What's the reaction time on the repair? It's just not in time. Slightly too slow, but can't blame him for that. This planetary survives. I can't believe we're actually going into a longer game. I really thought the game was over. Oh man, I should start preparing for this. Oh, another scan and I recall. All right, all right. Now, if we take a look at this situation, let's just, all right, let's just pass and take a step back. You always got to do this So what do we have here for the Protoss? We have an army that is extremely susceptible to any type of EMP Doesn't really deal well with higher liberator numbers either usually colossi are good against liberators or tempest but colossi stalker is good because you can kind of kill stuff that's in the liberator zone and try to blink forward like colossus stalker disruptor is a really nice composition for that there's no colossi here which means that in theory with just pure lib ghost marauder you can do it or if you have good micro just mass marauder with a bunch of ghosts also actually beats this army because you can EMP everything and kite back forever. Splitting with Marauders is relatively easy as well. So that's the type of fight that definitely can be won. This base is going to die to a couple of Zealots. We have the drop coming back once again. It does die this time, but actually create some space. So this was a nice move. Now, the final fight is, well, the final fight, I assume this is going to be one of the final fights. It's going to be the most important. So we see the Disruptors coming in. The scan is on the Disruptors. That's one. Do you get any more? Ah, okay, only one major shot gets it. Not a single EMP has been cast. Okay, there are EMP, EMP, of course, on the entire army. fight, actually Not going to pour, even though he took a full Disruptor hit to the face. Still floating a solid 2K resources as well. Slight over-stimming I have to make this game is becoming really tight I thought we were just going to be making fun of vegetable, but this game is pretty exciting actually. It's not exciting as in a Formula One race, you know? This is more where your neighborhood boy in his soap box car against another neighborhood boy in his soap box car, both built in a day and a half and when turning the first corner both the wheels fall off and now both of them are just pushing their body forward trying to make their soapbox advance and even though it's kind of a train wreck to watch you just still keep watching because you're curious if your seven or seven year old neighbor on the right side or your 12 year old neighbor on the left side is going to have more power in his body to push the soapbox forward so this is kind of what you're what you're looking at here just to give a little bit perspective a little bit of perspective to this game. There's only really a single disruptor left. If that doesn't hit a massive shot, I mean, the upgrades aren't that great. There is, what? One, two storms. Oh no. Good EMPs? Perfect EMPs. No scan! Oh, he can EMP the DTs. Man, this game is going down to the wire. There's still some mining left here. There's one base mining left here. I mean, I wouldn't say that Vexual played perfect, or close to perfect, or well, or even did a lot of good moves, but then he, he menemus. No, he's an idiot. What? Did he think he had won? Let's get into the mind of someone with barely double-digit IQ. What the hell was that? Did he think he won? He had to believe he'd lost and it was like his last ditch effort or something. So he moves in. He has what, how many scans available? two two it's gonna have three scans he's his income actually if he gets mining again with with this many MULEs it's gonna be close to what this guy has on you know one and a half base probably better so what he should do is he should scan up and he should move into the mineral line here to stop the Zealots from doing too much the 13 Zealots 3 DTs and 5 Stalkers 8 Marauders 14 Marines for it if you're in the mineral line over here there's no way in hell this force is going to be doing anything So we see a blink into this. What is he attacking at this? And instead of scanning the DTs or EMPing the zealots and microing his army, he decides the best way to use his already quite low APM How does this guy have 300 APM average? Okay, well, it's rather low APM to spend it on dropping two MULEs How the hell is that gonna help you dude? I even would have preferred him right-clicking the Nexus because then he's three base, or well, he has three-CC against against half a mining base And then you can pick up or something Me and Molo actually had the same sentiment I typed a question mark in my head as well. just inside my mind's eye was just a massive question where what's he's saying here Protoss is very broken you are an idiot you don't deserve this win I outplayed you a million times all of that in confined in three simple characters That's my My Mandarin is very high level And then he still stays in Is he gonna float his buildings? Is this actually the first floater we're gonna get? Oh man, this guy is a top lad This guy is a bottom tier vegetable Like a pee or something A kidney bean These are the worst It's not even really a vegetable We count them as a vegetable What is he doing? This game went from mediocre to bad, to mediocre. He forgets to DG as well, man Vegetable was proper fuming. This was beautiful Alright, Vegetable. Let me have a quick look at your email again Protoss is just broken His opening build did not work well At least he is self-aware But I took out Protoss third base in the mid-game Yeah, it's true You took out the Protoss third base and you completely won the game there You are floating 3K minerals at that point and about 800 gas while being even in supply Against the Protoss that had 9 Actually, you were up in supply I think he had like 106 against 92 However, the opponent produced Zealots like they were free He had like seven Zealots And High Templars were like hard. I don't actually think High Templars cast a single storm that hit. Like really, the main thing was the fight where you fought with 2-2 against 3-1 You lost your entire army for free while floating 3K And then the game still got close afterwards Then the Disruptor beat the K beat the crap out of me No, he hit a single disruptor shot on you This is the thing People send me this replays and they think they know the reason why they lost. They don't know the reason why they lost The reason why I lost was A, he was floating a crap ton of money. B, he took a fight in the middle of the map that was absolutely horrendous. I'm not even quite sure how to describe that fight. Like just before two, like literally 10 seconds before 2-2 finishes. The one thing that Vexual does not have is any type of timing. If I were to make a YouTube series with vegetable, the episodes would come out slower than they currently are with Casually Explained. Like this guy would always be too late, never on time, just not show up. This might be Casually Explained Star and Smur. I think we're onto something here. I'm gonna have to send a follow-up email to my boy Vegetable just to check a couple of things as some simple questions like are you a famous YouTuber? Yeah, altogether vegetable. I appreciate the effort that you put in and the manner mused even though you were losing a fight that you should have won if you just move and scan But at the end of the day, it's very simple, my friend High Templars didn't kill you Disruptors didn't beat the crap out of you No You beat yourself by not knowing timings, not understanding how tight works. that's a big mistake and thus you suck and you suck very hard. all right thanks everyone for watching I hope you did enjoy this episode of is it Imba or do I suck if you did don't forget to leave a comment down below subscribe to my channel and follow me on Patreon love you all and bye-bye."

        "text": "What's up friends, welcome back to Oh crap, I stopped doing this introduction Now my editor will roast me again Hi, Harstam Late game Zerg is Imba Especially versus Protoss And I think a big part of that is the Broodlord, Viper and Corruptor combo Please tell me if it is Imba or if it is Imba Maybe show us how pro gamers deal with Broodlords, because I see no solution Every single time I play a macro game versus Zerg, it ends up like this I didn't have the best fights, but I thought I played a better game than my opponent, until he decided to win by building aptly named Broodlords Sincerely, your fan from Canada All right, fan from Canada. Main complaint, Brood Lords, Brood Lords, in the late game of PvZ The little two side complaints, Corruptor and Viper So we can really see this as a bird where the best one body of the bird is the Brood Lord and the wings are the Corruptor and the Viper and our issue is is that the bird is pooping on our car and in this analogy the car is our MMR in Starcraft 2 and the bird is the Zerg player that annoys us so now that we've established exactly what we're dealing with let's see if there's a way to shoot this bird out of the air so to speak and most of all let's see if it is even possible to shoot this bird out of the air because this bird of course might have anti-bullet armor kevlar he's wearing a kevlar vest and Protoss players don't really have kevlar penetrating bullets so we need to figure a couple of things out of course first of all are Brood Lords broken and then secondary of all are the are the wings broken the Corruptor Viper are they broken but our main concern is going to be the Brood Lords we're going to be having a close look of everything that Heil Greta does, from now on just referred to as Greta, or our Canadian friend. But yeah, let's just have a look to see if there's any mistakes that he made at all, or if it is the Broodlords. Now. I believe this is a game from Diamond. Our friend is a Canadian, so I'm assuming he lives in Canada as well and plays on the North American server. Now, first mistake is not having a wall at the time where speed is finished. That's a mistake that's going to cost you a lot of games against Ling floods. Imagine this guy left the tab open and kept building Lings and all of a sudden you get Ling flooded. That's not very nice. Usually you drown and you lose your MMR. So I'd always say try to get your wall done before 3:00. 3:30 in the game It's a little quick tip here by the professional guys. Just write it down in your little notebook. It's a good tip. 3:30. try to get that Gateway down it should be possible with Stargate as well you just get it after the Oracle and after the third Pylon and you don't have to stop Probe production for that we see greta is stopping Probe production for a bit gets double gas before the Nexus not the tightest build that i've seen in my life are the greatest build but uh it looks fine you know it's it's it's somewhat uh similar to a build that the build that i shown casually explained where you just get a fast third base going to Robo get Observer out for scouting info maybe try to do some damage with Adepts maybe keep them it doesn't matter too much so let's have a look at these two Oracles see what they're going to be capable of doing here two Oracles of course the key number as i've discussed a couple of episodes ago two is a lot better than one uh about 50 percent better a hundred percent better um Fleet Beacon on the way now this is interesting this is not in any of my build orders this is so the thing here is is that it doesn't make a lot of sense with the Robo I like Robo if you're going to be going into Forge Twilight but if you're going to be going into Fleet Beacon I think it's better to just get a faster Fleet Beacon and a second Stargate so I'm not even going to necessarily hate on this build too much right the Fleet Beacon I don't necessarily hate but the Robo just is a little bit senseless in in that case, I believe, at least. Also, working in three Stalkers It's going to cost you a lot of gas Three Stalkers is basically equal to a Stargate, right? Gas-wise And gas is going to be the limiting factor for Protoss when you're doing a heavy tech build like Carrier So this is one of those things where you just see so many inaccuracies in a build, like the Robo, the Observer We're talking 175 gas already, three more Stalkers 150 gas and you work in two Sentries, another 200 gas and all of this is just delaying your Carriers from starting So even if I don't like the build to start with, even if I would have liked the build, going fast Carriers, I still wouldn't have liked your execution. So that is, you know, if there was a form about this builder, I would have to take no twice execution, no, and do I like it also? So no, even not considering the execution Your Oracles have done, well, is that five workers? Five worker kills I'm not going to flame you for that either I think that's completely fine Now, of course your opponents aren't great at defending Maybe you see a lot of openness I think you could have gotten a bit more, but you know, for your level, this is completely fine You got seven kills, you're up in workers, you're getting your Carriers out This is what we call a decent start. Now the real question for me is how the hell are you gonna lose the Broodlord? If you're going straight into carrier and you're gonna be up like seven upgrades or something like that. See this guy's playing Hydra Ling. He's still on 61 workers. I mean you're up in workers. Getting cannons already. I wouldn't even mind the fourth base pretty fast I guess as long as you don't see any drones on the fourth, it's not really necessary. But I wouldn't have mind it. So yeah, you don't have any carriers out yet and we're already seven minutes and 30 seconds in game. I think this could be done a lot smoother, a lot, a lot smoother. Just gonna speed up a bit. If the theme of this game is going to be camping behind Photon Cannons and Carriers, then, you know, we don't want to sit here for the next seven days. Hydra-Ling attack, okay, you're aware of this. Not really, but you're also, you should know that something is coming. I mean, you have units in position. You have, what, three Carriers, which can be used at this point. It's probably with the three Carriers and the Photon Cannons, a couple of decent forcefields should be enough to hold something like this, which is nice. Now, you're not getting any real info when it comes to work account, when it comes to tech, that kind of stuff. You're only releasing unit movement, which if you're paying attention to that should be good enough This one should be an easy win for you, right? He also stopped Carrier production for some reason Oh, you got to fly well That's another minor mistake We'll add it to the list Alright, so this fight should be kind of going into your, at least going your way somewhat Especially if you fight near Photon Cannons, right? There's absolutely no way this is going to do anything So I like continuing Carriers I'm not a big fan of Charge or Immortals here. Whenever you play carriers or fast carrier like you do actually let's hold that thought Ah okay, close Let's do that one more time alright The beautiful Force Field that blocks nothing All Baneling nest, alright um can I most likely clean up this army You just still have some interceptors left over, you have some stalkers which do damage That's all of good Now, when you think of carriers as a unit, what are their main attackers? They're the main guys that kill them, right? So let's just go over that Those are hydras and corruptors, majority of the time So if you're rushing into carriers, your follow-up should be, should be anticipating whatever it is he's going to be doing. So you want to be scouting, hey, is it hydras? And if it's hydras, your answer is going to be storm. If it's corruptors, your answer is either going to be storm or Archon, or it's going to be Void Ray, so you add more Stargate. Now, in general, I always like to rush out a couple of Templar if you do go into fast Carrier, because if your opponent actually has a very high Hydra count, and you don't have Storm, and they get good upgrades, and I'm talking like 2-2, for example like plus two attack and plus two carapace. This guy went plus two melee instead of carapace. Then Carriers actually will lose all their interceptors to the Hydras because you don't kill the Hydras fast enough. Um, so I always say try to rush out Storm. Like Immortals don't contribute anything to this army that the Carriers aren't already contributing. You're basically like they're not useful here. The Immortal, you know, Immortals will be able to kill Roaches but if he's getting Roaches you've already won the game because Roaches can't shoot up. If he's getting Lurkers, Immortals would be great, but Carriers destroy Lurkers, so the Immortal here is a unit that has no use whatsoever. The Zealots, I mean I understand why you would want to use them for harass, but do that after you get the things that you really need like your Storm, perhaps another Stargate. You have two right now, you could be getting three. Dark Shrine is a luxury thing as well. Like, don't get me wrong, you have plenty of money, but your priorities are completely incorrect. Like you're, you're pretending like it's a normal game, but you rushed out carriers. Stop pretending like it's a normal game. This is not normal. You know, this is the opposite of normal. It's weird. Nothing wrong with being weird, but at least embrace it a little bit. Can't go around, you know, walking in these long coast that cover your knees, all in black, and then pretend to like Ariana Grande, you know? I know you don't. I know you don't, great, eh? You don't like Ariana Grande. That is pop. You like goth rock or got metal. See what I mean? Another good real life analogy here, live on the Analogy channel. I'm your host, Kevin the Go-I Um. Where was I? I broke my own thought process. Right, storm, there we go, 12 minutes in, it's a little late, but yeah, you get it in the end, so I'm gonna scratch that Oh, no, I'm not gonna scratch on my little, that's still a complaint. But, but the, yeah, I'm still complaining about that You should have gotten it faster, like this army dies to storm Like, the flies in my room die to my fly swatter Real fast, as long as I manage to catch them It's the same with Hydras, as long as you hit them, like they're gonna die real quick So 2 DTs, I mean, these are all DTs, because I know I'm picking on these, but this is not TvT. You want to be getting a third base at this point. You're Hellion, you're on eight gas, man. You could be on four bases while still getting all of these things as well, producing carriers. Something that I also wouldn't mind you doing at this point is just moving out. You have a pretty powerful force. You're basically on your peak at this point, right? You have plus two upgrades you have storm, you have a decent carrier count, anything from here, he's just going to be more prepared, you know? Even if I still think it's completely possible to be the Zerg, that has the perfect army against carriers, it's better to hit when they don't have a perfect army against carriers. There's a reason why in war most people try to do surprise attacks Like you might still be able to win the war without doing a surprise attack, but it comes a hell of a lot easier if your opponent is drinking tea when you're, you're, you're, you come in with the guns, you know? It just makes life a little more convenient for you and less convenient for the other guy So always try to, whenever you have like a power spike of some sorts or when your storm finishes and upgrades finishes, try to use that And there will be people like, oh, that's a timing attack I'm a macro player I don't really care what you are. Like you're just going to use your timing advantage You don't use your timing advantage Like no matter if you're a macro player or a cheezer, you're just an idiot as well You know, both macro players and cheesers can be idiots. It's the beauty of it. It's not exclusive to any type of person Instead, you go back after having a fantastic trade You killed literally every single Viper You damaged a bunch of his Corruptors And you were still maxed and your plus three just finished So right now he has one one upgrades on Corruptors He has no carapace upgrades He has plus two and you have plus three on air Like this is as good as it's going to get upgrade wise for you. Is it good? It is as good as it's going to get unit-wise as well. Like his army doesn't look very scary. The only thing I wish is that you didn't have your Immortals and these were like two extra Archons instead. And your Stalkers were dead. All right, we'll ignore that for now. Pretend like it never happened Oh boy, Greta probably used to that What is that? If I don't speak to him, maybe he will just go away Poor Greta. Alright. Let's just analyze this situation real fast Alright? Ding-da-da-d-ding-ting-ting-ting So, you know you are on Creep You know your opponent has full vision on you Complete, complete vision. Whenever you're in Creep, this is the scariest moment in your life. Okay? This is, nothing is gonna beat this Like, absolutely nothing Like, your entire life, this is what matters. This is what should scare you Creep. He has full vision, his units move five times as fast as they usually do And what you decide is the correct play is to move your Templar and Archon away from defending your carriers and attack rocks in the middle of the map The only reason why I can see that you would be attacking these rocks in the middle of the map is because you're scared of their intellect. You might not be the smartest person in this portion of the map anymore. Because holy crap, dude, this is some insane levels of stupidity Like what's wrong with you? Your own creep, you know he has Vipers, you know his Corruptors There you go Lose a Carrier Lose another Carrier Hell Lose another Carrier Three Carriers Gone for free before your Templars are even bad If you continued focus firing, you probably would have lost every single Carrier ever Like this fight, you should have completely destroyed it Like, you're still up in supply Don't get me wrong, but you're probably going to lose some stuff on the retreat You're out of storms, you're out of interceptors Like, you should have destroyed this fight so hard, dude This shouldn't even be closed. Here, this is where he should have left and this is where he should have been sending me the replay. The Archons are completely broken. I played perfectly and very better creep spread than him. But in the end I just lost. Well, this is. This is what should have happened. In a different timeline, where you're not so threatened by the IQ of a rock, you would have won the game here. You would have gotten 25 points. Man, he would have laughed to yourself, Stupid Zerg, man, building Hydralisks against Storm, man, Corruptors against Carriers, no, you need Infestors, hmm. Then you would have laughed at his Imba episode that I would have made, making fun of his unit control or something or the way that he did things But no, this is the timeline wherein, my friend, and are he too stuck? Oh no Greta, Greta, Greta, man, they look really pretty Like decoration on the wall, you know Not gonna be too useful anyway this game So he pees on your Nexus You come to the rescue with your Archons and other things, not really to the rescue So this is another reason why I said before, I think it's good to have more Stargates Oh yeah, four Stargates actually Okay, I take back You know, four Stargates, that's nice. I'm a fan of that I'm a fan of that I've Zealot run by, strike to do some damage I also don't mind that completely Don't get me wrong You're still in a good thing spot Units lost, you're still ahead Like you're, the problem isn't with how, where you are in the game, is a problem where you should, what are you doing? Where you should be in the game And right now where you should be on the game is probably not here on the map Like currently, you're not maxed You have a crap ton of supply in Stargates. Um, like why would you want to be on the map right now? Like the carrier army is the best when it's maxed, basically, or getting close to max you also really want to get rid of crap units before you go do something and what i mean with that is that you're what hell you have nine stalkers like stalkers are completely useless in this situation please don't get them okay you don't want you don't want you don't want the things you do want are either a mothership for invisibility more templar more carriers maybe a couple of Void Rays i mean we see a big corruptor army now i I always say Void Ray is the most useless unit until corruptors come out. Then it's still very low on the list, but it's at least slightly more useful than a Stalker Archons are nice to have as long as there's no Broodlords Archons are completely fine as well I'm a big fan of that But yeah, try, all right? Just try to do your best Get rid of the Stalkers Okay, and there's two ways you can get rid of the Stalkers You can either assist them in suicide. side or you can just send them in here which also is practically some type of weird suicide so just do that all right just send them in there and right click it now another thing that you've been lacking for a while now is Oracles Oracles with revelation well actually you have one you're just not using it Oracles with revelation are a very powerful tool at seeing where your opponent's Viper Corruptor army is and it really helps in the the micro against why we are Tempests in the corner why why would you do that it's just a little bit sad this feeling inside storm storm storm storm storm storm storm so down them out with storms i love how you have like 25 supply over here just chilling not doing anything. Life is life I guess, eh? La la la la la la. Yeah, some more harassed now don't get me wrong. Are you still ahead? I was gonna say you're still ahead but I'm not sure anymore you have good income. Problem is your gas is a little low. I think it's fine still for you honestly. His army is still utter crap. Is Hydra Corruptor but your army whenever you lose Carriers you decide to either build more Stalkers or you add more DTs like just build more Carriers dude we need higher Carrier count Observer speed how many Templar is there 11 that's slightly too high against 24 Hydras I think 8 Templar would have been fine but 11 you know I'm not going to blame you for it the main issue is with the Stalkers here because really if we look at what your army you consist of it's mediocre at best you know you have about you have eight Zealots nine Stalkers four Carriers four Archons really the main DPS is coming from the storms here which is fine as long as there's no Broodlords or any type of major anti-ground like you don't actually have good units that do DPS all right What is that? How many Corruptors are like 22? Well, Mr. Corruptor man Let's see what you can do here I honestly still like it for the Protoss here Like, our boy Greta made some mistakes and his army might look like crap Sure, his run-bys haven't really been worked. By seven haven't really been working and he just lost his bottom right base but he still has an army that that should be feared oh my god what is this okay there we go good movement for care there's only four Carriers it really is too little you need more Carriers but every single time he loses some type of units he just rebuilds Zealots or he gets more Archons right now we're at six six Archons that's gonna get bleeped out is that a bad word um Some creed in the hill I don't even mind that That seems good Alright, here comes the fight High Templar, 11 High Templar Don't forget that's the main DPS of the army We get two, three storms hitting half a Corruptor. Okay, now you have some forms hitting stuff. That's good And the fight changed for the better there towards the end. You saw at the start how bad it went If the Templar aren't there, like, this is pretty key. You know, like Imagine you are an army and you have a secret weapon secret weapon and the secret weapon is a tank All right, it's a massive. Imagine, imagine we're fighting in Roman Empire times, right? The Roman Empire led by Julius Caesar against the Vikings All right? These live that around a similar time. So let's square these two guys off Now, the Vikings didn't have a gun. They just used swords Same with the Roman Empire. Now imagine that the Roman Empire managed to construct a vehicle that is a tank and it shoots massive bullets and makes stuff explode The problem with the tank is that it is rather slow And a great war general like Julius Caesar might understand that the rest of his army in order to survive will move at the same speed as the secret weapon the tank Otherwise what's going to happen is your tank is gonna arrive when all your infantry has died That's not very smart Now, Greta is the Roman Empire and the Templars are a tank The problem here is, is that we have Greta rather than Julius Caesar as the war general. And these Vikings, they're gonna be doing some real damage if they don't get shot by the Tank. It's honestly a terrible What? How is it that whenever I get a replay from anyone below Masters, that the majority of the title is just kind of storming their own units? It's just something they enjoy. It's like one of these weird games. They play in Masters. He's actually running out of gas. It really should be prioritizing getting gas somewhere now. He has four Assimilators, four gas geysers. Assimilators, there we go. I like that he's using Zealots now for run-bys, but this is something that happens very often, all right? Actually, it's going to end up well. But very often when people have only minerals left, they start using massive Zealot run-bys, and they also stop caring about them So they just pretend, like, ah, it's just money, you know, I can just put it into Zealots I don't have gas anyway And then later on, when they're all of a sudden completely out of bank, they go like, oh, crap, I wish I just had 50 minerals again, so I could rebuild this Nexus Well, shouldn't have warped in 25 Zealots and send them straight into their death This is a very common occurrence Honestly, this game still looks pretty good for our Protoss player Mineral count is extremely low for the Zerg This army is utter crap. Like if we think of the ground army now, and now there's a move which you can do, which is absolutely genius. it's called a tech switch. So rather than staying on the same composition for the entire game, you try to react to what your opponent does. Now this might. That's painful. This might sound revolutionary to some of you guys. But imagine you see an army consisting of 31 Corruptors and seven Hydras. Now there's two things you can do. You can either continue Carrier production. So your opponent already has the counter ready. Or you can start working on a massive ground force. Now what Greta does over here. What surprisingly is he continues Carrier production because what is better to count there 31 Corruptors than two Carriers? I like the way you're thinking here, Greta. I like the way you're thinking. Because if you would have focused too much on killing the ground, you might have accidentally won the game. I mean, there's seven Hydras and 24 Lings right now. With your 16 Zealots, 10 Stalkers, you probably can just aim of across the map. Now imagine that the money that you just put into carriers you put into blink or something like that, then even if there's a low count of Broodlords, you can actually do something because there's no ground force to protect them. That sounds very smart, doesn't it? But no carriers is the way. I love it. That's good stuff. Because right now the only thing Aqua Black can actually beat is an air army. He's like, oh my God, please for the sake of everything that's holy, you know, please don't show up with more than three ground units because he can't actually kill them. No, no, he gets six Broodlords. And now he's actually getting a slightly scarier Broodlord count And at this point, you could still say, well, if you would have just built a ground army now, you wouldn't have done anything No, you would have done something You would have won the freaking game, dude Even if there's nine or ten Broodlords and you have 16, 17 Stalkers, if there's no ground army to defend the Broodlords, you could just blink under and target them down There's absolutely no problem The thing is, when you have Carriers, you're not going to be blinking under and killing stuff. What you're going to do is you're going to be fighting the Corruptors, because in your head the Carrier is the most important unit and the way to preserve the Carrier is to kill the Corruptors so instead of just killing the only thing that can kill ground in this case the Broodlord what you're going to end up doing is you're going to fight the Corruptors while your entire ground army dies to eight or nine Broodlords and three Zealots or three Lings and five Hydras we know that's what's going to happen here we're going to watch it we're going to laugh at him this is not a Tempest Oh there goes the first Carriers. Oh crap First Carrier gone, oh no. Second carry, man, what a surprise Like literally getting one shot by the 95 corruptors that are still on the map And all of some, Aqua Blacks are wait a second I think I might be winning this I mean, I only have 21 workers I don't have a ground army to speak of whatsoever And my army is literally the slowest in the game like even leapfrogging siege tanks move faster across the map than Broodlords do But I don't think that's going to stop Aqua Black from doing what he's about to do, which is probably, okay, there's two scenarios here. Either Terran is going to stay at home and defend against this army and die because he's going to be fighting the Corruptors mainly, or Terran is going to do a desperation attack, even though he's up 50 workers. Oh, it looks like we're gonna get scenario one over here. This is, I absolutely love this. Now, the reason why I love this is because this army, in a million years, can't get back. It's just not possible. You can't get back. That with this, low basis, low basis. If he's all the way over here and the Protoss, it needs to make a mature decision here. He's like, all right, this base is gone. Donzo, you know, and you just give it up and you kill everything else on the map, either with run bys or with your main army, you're going to be completely fine But instead what he does is he takes a fight on a ramp while being slaughtered by Broodlords from the side This is what I was talking about earlier, by the way You see Broodlords are not getting attacked He's killing the Corruptors, which the Corruptors have no real use Like, honestly, almost no real use Like they do need to kill the Carriers and the Tempest, but that obviously. he's gonna happen there's like 25 of them you know and by the time that great i realized oh wait a second i don't have air units who protect anymore maybe i should have attempted Broodlords earlier because his army actually isn't that scary now he's getting blink he's getting a Mothership he's like huh wait a second what if i had 25 stalkers that man that would have really neat but instead he doesn't have blink he doesn't have 25 stalkers he went five carriers two Void Rays and Mothership and now he's about to aim off with Zealots Three stalkers without blink, a single Templar with two storms and three Archons that are killing the broodlings underneath these Broodlords. And this is, this is Peak Starcraft When I picked up this game 10 years ago, I didn't know quite what Peak Starcraft was, but after watching this game evolve over the past 10 years, I know that this, it doesn't get much better than this This is what it is It's units that can't detect Broodlords walking under the Broodlords to kill the Broodlings as they pop That is what Peak Starcraft looks Now, here we have the desperation base rate, which he also could have done earlier when it wasn't a desperation move, but actually a good play There's the beauty of a lot of desperation moves A lot of desperation moves are actually kind of good. The problem is, they're not good because you're already dead at that point. You know, going for a base trade, most of the time only happens when people realize they're really far behind They go like, oh, the only way for me to win is a base trade. Well, imagine how good that only way to win was, when you were like light years ahead like you could have done that as well you know you don't need to wait to be behind until you start pulling out the good moves it's a common occurrence i see in low level games especially where people were like i had no time to base trade i'm ahead well i mean if you get a good opportunity to base trade and you're really far ahead you probably should take it you know you probably should take it now we basically have grata do what i recommended grata to do about what was it 25 yeah five minutes five or six minutes ago seven minutes ago. We have a bunch of Blink Stalkers. At this point, sadly, there's also 23 Hydralisks again, so there's actually some anti-ground. There is still a couple of storms, but I mean, if he gets the Broodlords separated, it's still completely possible. And you just right-click Broodlords? Okay, never mind. He absolutely died. And you did get the Broodlords, but Yeah, I think it's gonna be enough, guys. I don't think something. This is one of the final. We have some Zealots over here doing nothing. Making sure that this base never gets up again. There's an empty base as well, that's great. Get it real good. Kill the Hatchery, don't kill any of the tag. There you go, that's better. Gets one more base. Yeah, this is rough to watch, guys. Rough to watch We still have one base mining for black, aqua black, and we have nothing for Greta here So, I think this is going to be think this is going to be it. Let's pop forward Now, usually I just end the replay here, but I have a feeling that Greta, after such a long game of disappointment upon disappointment, might have a couple of words for our opponent So I just want to make sure that, you know, we don't miss any major BN There we go It's going to be it Can't say something, Greta? Danis still playing the game. Fifteen Stalkers There's some income again Maybe it's possible No way, right? Alright. Time to leave, great. I'll stop wasting our time. Say something fine as well Oh, this base actually going down 22 supply against 80 Neither players have income anymore. Okay, now this base still as income No GG oh Greta Why didn't GG because my opponent definitely didn't deserve it Greta, great, great, great, great, great, oh, yoy. Where do we start? We started the start. Your early game wasn't that great, right? We didn't like the build order. We didn't like the way you executed it. I didn't like that your Carrier production was picking up steam so slowly you should have added a third Stargate way faster Your macro in general was quite bad You were floating 2K resources throughout almost the entirety of the game. The way you took fights was bad High Templar are often trailing behind Unit composition, even though he had a lot of time to craft it He didn't really feel very powerful A lack of Carriers, too many Stalkers Then after a while, while he only had like 10 ground units and 31 Corruptors, you continued Carrier production rather than switching back into ground Your blink was too late Your harass wasn't that bad You did a lot of damage with Zealot harass and I'm proud of you for that But I'm sad to tell you that that's not gonna mask all the incompetence you have shown in this game, which is a big list, honestly. Broodlords are good, Corruptors Vipers are good, but your unit movement was absolutely terrible. Your unit composition crafting was absolutely F tier. That's the lowest tier, by the way. There's nothing below that. It's like, it's just you. If we had a tier maker, you'd be on the bottom list, Greta. I'm sorry to tell you, but you suck. And oh, do you suck hard, my friend? Oh, yes, you do. All right. That's going to be it for me today. If you didn't enjoy this video, don't forget to subscribe to my channel up here.

        "text": "Hi, Harsden Recently I've been struggling against Terran mech While I didn't enjoy the Broodlord Infestor style of the past at all, nowadays it feels like Terran gets a similar amount of bases up, and just turtles, it becomes nearly impossible to defeat It seems to me that Zerg late game sucks Broodlords die to Thors, die to Thors Ultras died to everything, and Infestors require your opponent to suck and not scan when they move out Usually the strategy I go for is to go up to 90 plus workers as soon as I recognize it's a turtle Terran, and try to prevent them from expanding to a fifth. I know I won't ever get an efficient trade in the late game, but it doesn't matter if I have more resources than they do So, is it Imba or do I suck? Thanks Loco Oof Mr Loco decided it was time to send a replay in as he had a latter game in which he just could not fight the mechanical Terran army Now, once I saw this replay guys, I changed my life I shower this morning, which is something that usually only happens once a week Put on a nice shirt, comb my hair, put on some cologne, as it's ready to bury a fellow content creator. We have a replay here with a well, I mean, when I say bury, I mean, of course, analyze whether any mistakes were made He said mech is overpowered, everything he can do against it sucks, and we're here just to judge to see if he made any mistakes So is it Imba or does it suck? And yeah, let's hold straight into it So it's a game on ice and chrome between him and a Terran called SJK Let's see how it goes I'm not quite sure how good this SJK is, but local is pretty decent at the game Might I say, he's pretty damn good. So it's interesting to see a high level game like this Let's see what happens at this guys. So we have the standard SCV Reaper stuff trying to deny a third base Locco is pretty smart Takes the other third base on the map like ice and chrome That's no problem Loses a drone to a Reaper That's not quite as brilliant But you know, I sometimes lose two probes to a Reaper So losing one drone to the Reaper, you know, everyone has bad days We're not, we're not going to blame him too much for that All right We're not going to blame him too much for that So it's on a creep tumor at the perfect time. forgets about this uh no actually so far everything is good perhaps the second queen at some point or a third queen and uh yeah life is going to be completely fine here for my good friend loco so far yeah loco first three minutes well i don't want to say perfect because you lost a worker but i mean the build order everything so far makes sense i'm a i'm definitely a fan Reaper comes back in okay okay two drones at this stage in the game i'm not too sure we're still lacking an extra queen as well so i'm i'm not i'm not too fond of the opening okay not not too fond of the opening anywhere third queen is a little bit late which means uh decisions will have to be made whether you want to inject or put creep tumors down at this point let's see what local decides to do opponent the meanwhile is using his barracks to float for the for the high ground Now usually, this is an indicator of something macro afterwards, right? It could be a fusion core for Battlecruisers like we're seeing here. It could be just Benji It is going to be a fusion core, which I'm excited for Battlecruisers are always quite exciting Local has almost no scouting information, has been supply blocked for quite some time It's still only on three queens, four minutes into the game That is pretty slow if you compare it to most other people They would have way more queens A lot of the time you'll see them produce three queens from their natural hatchery and then get their next queen over here at the at the fort base as well and they kind of continue queen production until they have seven or eight queens against their and majority of the time queens also should always be in position to stop any types of helions from just poking on the creep now the way you want to he also finish this extractor okay i didn't see that that's pretty funny um that's not perfect Dida Loco Once again, I can forgive you these minor errors So you want to have overlords kind of at the edge of the creek So you can spot halion movement easily. And that way you kind of mirror the movement of the halions with your queens So you'd have an overlord over here, maybe an overlord over here I mean, this overlord, I guess it's quite useful This one could be pushed a bit further down as well So you have a quicker way of spotting things This overlord is being kind of useless This overlord is being pretty useless So we have two, three overlord Oh my god, there's two more here We have four or five overlords that could be positioned in different places as to make it a lot easier to counter any type of helion play Now, like I said before, his queen count is a lot lower than it should be. And it's not going to be He also rushed layer to go straight into Beinling's speed Now this is a move I haven't seen before Nowadays when we see layer rushes, we see them either for an extremely fast spire, or, well, actually, that's just it They just see them for an extremely fast spire I haven't really seen them for anything else whatsoever to speak of So I am not entirely sure what this is for, honestly We have a couple of halions now coming in I mean, there's three banlings, but you're not really going to be catching aliens with banlings I guess he does catch a couple But I mean, that's even without bainting speed So I'm not sure about it. Battle Cruiser comes in here Now, when we think of Mac, we see two very popular responses in the pro scene And a very common response we see is Masmuda And people say, well, what about Tours? Doesn't Thor just kill Masmuda? You'd be surprised how well these top players do with Mass Muda Muda against Thor And another one is most of the time Ravager roach corruptor and then going into Lingbane Ravager after on high work accounts and just continuously trying to kill bases on the side and playing this very high momentum game with rather inefficient trades, but because you're outmining your opponent by so much, a lot of the time you're going to be able to just kind of kill them. Like they'll run out of money eventually and then you win Mac is kind of popular at the moment in the professional meta as well but it hasn't been doing extremely hot honestly it you know the the the times I see Mac a lot of the time the Zirk ends up winning so here we have so you have plus one on range and we have Carapace upgrade so this should be Roach Corruptor Spire? And four more queens I am afraid Loco is slowly losing the plot a little bit here He is slowly losing the plot I think he just went in a cinema and he expected to watch the Incredibles. But really, he's watching a human centipede and he's confused where the superheroes are and what these people are doing to each other Huh Yes, loco, this is cinema hall too Here we play Roach Corruptor Corruptor Hydra is not a composition In order to ensure that all my information is correct, you know, as I'm here possibly roasting a fellow content creator, I have a couple of help lines and I'd like to use the first one So here comes the first Terran expert Alright, I'm going to ask you a question and I want you to answer it honestly, okay? Okay Okay. What do we think of Hydra Corruptor as a composition to beat Battle Cruiser Mac? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha No, no, this was fine Well, that terran expert seemed pretty clear on loco's decisions so far so far let's continue into this game hydra corruptor doesn't really seem to be a composition here so we will you know we'll put that as the first strike and we're gonna use first strike system we're gonna use the American justice system which is based on baseball so three strikes and you're out so we're gonna be using here and for right now local has got his first major strike let's see how many we can rack up in this game. Corruptor Hydra, not a composition That's a creature that's actually looking pretty good His work account is looking good How is his information looking? I mean he knows it's Mech which is interesting He knows it's what you call these bad boys? Battlecruisers He's doing a fine job stopping the Battlecruiser from doing any damage Now the thing when you when you think about Mech and especially with Corruptor based plays, is that a lot of the time you don't really want to use these as a late game composition very much. A lot of the time what you want to do is you kind of want to stop the battle cruisers with your corruptors and then do big attacks on the fourth base, on the third base, with high bainling counts, the snide planetaries basically That's kind of what you want to be doing You want to be playing an aggressive style If you don't want to be playing an aggressive style, you've got to take very fast into Hive to get quickly into Vipers because Viper is the one unit that can help you trade very well against Mac compositions So in that case with big Viber counts, you're just trying to walk around, pick of a tank here and there. I mean, there's nothing really here right now to deal with Vipers, right? There's basically pure tank There's a couple of battle cruisers, but you can just pick these up. Now, as we continue in this game, we still see, of course, the resource advantage here for a logo, which is extreme ice getting a lurker then all right well i'm curious to see what he's going to use it for this could just be as a distraction for when the terran scans and he sees oh a lurker then my opponent is an idiot then he might start playing worse i kind of like that idea of loco honestly because in his current composition is that great isn't that great already and his opponent probably is already considering that his opponent you know might not be the brightest uh Two in the chat Yeah, here we go Here's the scan He's like, ah, Lurkers. This guy's an idiot This is a free win So I wouldn't be surprised if we're going to see way more dangerous unit movement and just bad moves all around now from the Tarrin Because like, well, if someone builds Lurkers against Mac, that person definitely didn't finish elementary school So, up I really liked this by Logo, actually I'm kind of tempted to remove one of the strike just for this brilliant move As long as he doesn't actually be as he doesn't actually build any lurkers, we're going to be completely fine Gets his vipers, which is good Seismic spines, he's sticking to the part So whenever this gets scanned again, the Terran sees, ah, he's actually researching upgrades as well That's rather idiotic. And then, you know, the Terran will start playing even worse So you see that Loco is not only a fantastic content creator on YouTube, he also has a massive brain really thinking about the, you know, the mind games, just the things that you can do with the brain he's fantastic at that apparently Now, this kind of rotations are really painful to watch, of course, especially if they're completely done in vision Whenever you're playing against Mac, you want to be confusing your opponent with quick rotations from base to base And the way to do that is to always take the shortest route around So you push in here, you check over here Well, you don't push, but you like, you poke. You poke, you prod, you poke, you prod over here, and then you just keep going until you see a vulnerable angle because the Terran army, this is the one thing that Max sucks at, is at moving around It is slow It is crap It doesn't do his job very well You know, at least moving around It doesn't do that job at all, honestly So at this point, Loco has hydras and corruptors Both units are extremely good at dealing with battle cruisers, which right now they're still three off, and both the armies are really just kind of out of position. This is why Hydra Corruptor isn't that great both of them fulfill a very similar role which isn't Isn't that that useful to have you know like you you already got that covered with the corruptors You don't need more hydras like roaches or ravagers would be a lot better they're cheaper You can get them out a lot faster a lot they're less gas heavy which allows you to attack to a high faster get those vipers now When you have vipers what you want to be doing as cirque is you want to be trading like you just want to be spending and Oh no I'm kind of tempted to remove one of the strike just for this brilliant move. As long as he doesn't actually build any lurkers Poor loco So, let me finish my sentence before I make a bad joke With Vipers, you want to be trading energy for units So you constantly want to be abducting units into preferably a roach, or Roach Reveder or Roach Reveager Bain Army So you're constantly training keeping your opponents bank low, preferably even keeping them below 200 supply, which is definitely possible I mean these fibers have been flying around for a very long time, and these are the first two abducts, and they're not even into something Right now, this is what should be happening all the time You should just constantly be abducting, abducting, abducting Now for my bad joke. So if you guys remember the Matrix, at a certain point, the MAPTC, the main guy, I'm not gonna spoil too much, Neo needs to pick between two pills You got the red pill and you got the blue pill I can't even remember what the pills do, it doesn't matter Now, Loco also once met a guy and he said, I have three pills for you Here's the red pill, the blue pill, and here's the green pill If you take the green pill, you will think that Lurkers are a good idea against Mac And Loco, I'll take the green one, ate it, and now Loco lost not only 25 IQ by taking the green pill, but he also believes that lurkers are good against Mac. Which is honestly a bit of an issue Let's just say that if Local was the main character in the Matrix, that movie would have a very different ending Oh, the Lurkers maybe good against the robots? No They're not good against the robots Man, the robots can fly So yeah, Lurkers, the reason why Lurkers are not that brilliant against Mac is because everything outranges the lurker The lurker is good because it can outrange things This is this is good loco This is what we needed to be doing for the past four minutes Ever since we had these vipers out, like there's nothing to be able to deal with these vipers Absolutely nothing. All you need to do is pop, there we go, keep pulling them The problem is he doesn't really have units because he has so much supply He has 13 corruptors, he has 6 hyras and 4 lurr He doesn't actually have an army Like his entire army right now is consisting of support units, which makes absolutely no sense It's not, it's like starting a football team with like 12 goalies Like first of all, you're only allowed to have 11 men on the pitch, and second of all, even if you're allowed to have 12, this would still be a terrible idea So I kind of like that he's throwing away his corruptors and actually getting a decent rate with it. This is a, it looks like a bad move, but it's a good move Get rid of them They'll need them anymore Seven Vipers, perhaps is also a little bit over-sealous on the Vipcar I think you only need like four, maybe five It should be fine But I'm a fan that he has so many and that we're finally trying to get some trades down Whop And actually, every time he pulls them in, he does get kills, right? Even though it's slow because he only has like five fighting units he's actually getting good trades He's still down in units lost because his initial trades weren't that brilliant But he is at least trading at some point. And as you can see right now, when Zerk starts trading, you see that his bank is still massive The other guy isn't even maxed and is losing a bank This is literally all he needs to do, and he needed to be doing it for the past four or five minutes Like he can start doing this Hello? Is a stationary unit going to kill a viper? Actually, I think it might have killed him, but it's okay We can let it slip by We give a second major strike, by the way, for the fact that Loco hadn't been using his vipers very well Also, now that the corruptors are gone, you see all of a sudden this army looks a lot scarier. And I said that Hydra corrupter is in the composition Hydra viper actually is kind of playable, I guess It's not super popular anymore It used to be a lot more popular back in the day Nowadays it's all about these banlings blowing up bases, but I mean this can really trade very well I don't understand why he uses these hydras so forward rather than using them in unison with these vipers though That makes very little sense to me The battle cruiser run by This is something that he's been doing pretty poor, I was going to say, but now he does well He splits of part of his army rather than his entire army That's good Because then. I was going to say he can keep on trading But he doesn't keep trading He just loses units Where are your vipers game We still have vipers available And there's still two lurkers, which God knows what these guys are going to be up to Now, what Loco needs to do, once again, is he just needs to get his crap together You know a thing he could also do is 8K minerals He could build some static defense over here so he doesn't need to think about any type of run by And then all he needs to do is just pull, pull, pull in, pull in, pull in, hop We get a trade On our viper side, not too great, but it's better to trade. Like when you think of a meg army, what you want to be doing is you just want to, in the end, there's one thing that's loco is most likely going to be right in and that is your fights most likely are not going to be efficient and that's completely fine because as a zirk player you have so much more mobility that you should be capable of denying his bases at a way higher rate than he can deny yours you should be able to mine way more than him and you should be able to constantly be forcing fights because you have abduct only when the terran gets ghost out do vipers become useless? Before that, they're always going to be able to trade. You see, every time he has energy on vipers, and he has his entire army together, he's getting good trades Now, see, who you see, whoop, hey, here we go Still, actually, he's getting way closer in resources lost Now, let's analyze this situation for a second here A little bit of midgame review Ding-da-d-d-ding-ting, ding-ting-ting-ting This base, completely open No planetary, zero tanks, absolutely nothing He's not aware of it, but I think you could guess that there might be a base here This base, one, two, three Three tanks, planetary basically done, two battle cruisers, four, five turrets Now, we can do two things here We can either attack into this base and probably kill it against some losses, or we can get it for free. Or what we can do is we can keep attacking this until we think that a fight might go kind of sour and then go over here to attack this base Also, we could just send it three hydras over here, clear this base, force it to lift off while we're killing this one Let's see what local decides He goes for this base Instead of right-clicking the base, he moves commands into tanks to clear a turret, does not finish down the planetary, loses about 15 hydras, a couple of overseers, leave this base alive as well, and then moves back I hadn't even thought of that scenario. I had three scenarios, the loco, our green-pilled hero, once again figured out a scenario which I didn't know was there I just didn't know it was there Very impressive You know, usually when at companies, imagine this, you're in charge of the hiring process of a company. And your manager tells you to hire someone, needs to be able to think out of the box and your guy comes back with local your manager is gonna be fuming you know this is why you specify that when you think out of the box it still needs to be good thinking you know like thinking outside of the box isn't necessarily good it's like all right we have we have two scenarios here guys we either need to cut the cost by you know sacking a couple of or you know we need to we need to somehow get our products cheaper and a local comes with a suggestion like how about we build down the warehouse of our supplier and on the meeting is us oh my god who hired this guy green pill logo for you my friends green pill loco for you the man the mid the legends two lurkers still holding their you know holding down the fort at this point loco about to get the realization that tanks actually have superior range two Lurker Dan has done absolutely nothing good so far this game. Once again entire army getting pulled out of position by two units Loses a base, loses a bunch of drones Even though actually the trades haven't been going that poor The last few trades were kind of crap, the one where he walked into the planetary But before that, every time he actually fights, he kind of does well Like, he actually is doing a pretty decent job This? You know? I like this You guys might look at this. it is right just waiting for so many bainting to a planetary yes but he's denying mining against a terran that's gonna be hello okay that's gonna be on lower base count now now that's completely fine the thing is you need to use this momentum to keep going you break location you want to be breaking more locations you get a good trade yes this is what you need to do you have so much money in the bank this is absolutely perfect you need to keep your freaking vipers alive though You don't have your vipers alive This kind of stuff just isn't useful because you need to continuously be training Now, even at this point. So we saw a fight which was probably slightly inefficient for Zerg But if we look at everything that has just happened, is we have an 8K, 8K bank here for Zerg We have a 700 bank for the Terran Zerg has map control He has decent creep spread out He should be taking this base Everything I say about split map scenarios versus Terran, where you don't want to have them are untrue once Zerg is up a base Now, I'm not great at counting, but most mineral patches have about 1500 minerals Some of them have a little less What is it? 800 900 So in a base, you're gonna get about, what is it, 5K minerals I don't care, approximately 6K minerals, 7K minerals. 10K, more like 10K minerals You're gonna better get about 10K minerals, okay, all right, per base The moment you take an extra base, you're basically up two bases, right? So instead of it being 7, 7, all of a sudden you had 8 and he only had 6, which means you have like 20K more minerals, you're going to get what, like 10K more gas So all of a sudden you can be down 30k in units lost if you get a proper split map scenario where you mine one more base This base is going to be impossible for the Tarrant to keep It's too far out of the way He can never defend this area He can never defend this area. Like, he would need to put three tanks over here But without any backup defense, a couple of vipers would be able to completely destroy that Terran can only, the only thing Terran can do is push this base So loco main priority should be mining out this base and mining out this base as fast as possible Because then he can take the fights that he's been taking again and again and again without having to push his advantage So there's two major ways in which you can beat there One is by getting more mining and do a split map scenario And two is by putting very high pressure on the terran and winning purely through momentum Now, like I said, I like the bailing stuff. The thing is you need to keep going after it You can't just do one of these, then wait four minutes until the terran establishes the position again and then go again The moment you put on pressure is the moment you need to keep going again and again Now actually local was having good fights with the viper stuff I'm not quite sure why he stopped fibers in general even if you're going into a baling composition as long as you have some type of Hydra. Why does he have 19 corruptors again? The deal with the battle cruisers? There's not that many battle cruisers like like the 90 corruptors are complete dead weight in this army honestly like honestly complete that way this way this could have been like 25 viper or 25 hydras and I don't know like four or five Vipers extra And then you still have so much left over for balings as well, which could be used to pick off outside bases, pushing into positions after you cleared up These are not good traits He just doesn't have the ground army to deal with this He just sends in 20 bailings to their death, then seven more hydras, then three more hydras, just to clear five tanks. Like, this is not how it's supposed to happen These trades should be going way better And really, once you clear these tanks, this base is defended that So you always got to think of how Terran splits their supply, right? They have a bunch of supply in these battle cruisers That could be stopped probably with a couple more spores Maybe a small hydra force to deal with that Maybe some spines deal with these heliens And then Terran needs to defend this area, or you can walk there, they need to defend this area, they need to defend this area, and they need to defend this area So there's There's one, two, three, four main areas. One, two, three, yeah, four main areas that Terra needs to defend They're going to need more than two tanks per area there Or they need to continuously be moving around Like this, this should not be possible There's not If you have a well-organized attack on this position, Zirc should lose maybe three units here and should absolutely crush this. And that's exactly what happens, right? Now, you're going to need to temporarily give this up, but you create, like, if he starts, a base trade that's really good for sure right you have a big bank you should have larva available you can just keep going you just keep pushing you go into their production you probably win the game like you're way faster at killing stuff unless I guess your army consists of 40s Brutelage I'm not a big fan of the Roodlers usually oh my god it's just really straight into the end of it We get the resource loss now Ever since he started transitioning into Baino, it's going worse and worse, which it makes sense because you're going to trade worse against Army. So whenever you play a Bainling style, you really need to bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, and if you can't bang, bang, then don't get the bainling You know, just stay on Hydra Viper, in that case, or stay on Roach, Roach Viper, Rove, whatever you want to do. playing catch you know this is it's just not what you're supposed to do when you have brute lord you you hope to fight like in the next few seconds like you're not going to be chasing heliens around with brute lord hopefully because they're really freaking slow mac is slow like literally the only thing slower than mech in this world is uh is the brute lord perhaps loco's decision making just kidding loco i love i love you buddy um going in for a command center Vipers are coming back in the game I kind of like that, but his army is so, I'm not even quite sure what the play It's Corruptor Hydra Ultra Fiper, although 50 drones. He doesn't really have a, like what is the goal of this army? The goal of this army is to have a good engagement But if you're going for engagement, the thing you need, like this is another way actually to win You can have good engagements, against Mac armies But in that case, you need investors And you need neural So you can neural five, six of the Mac Army The Mac Army kills itself while your Hydra, Ultra Force, perhaps with some banlings I don't even mind some corruptors in that case, moves in and kills it But without investor, it's absolutely impossible You can take a straight up engagement into a siege-up, maxed-out Mac-Army with non-spell casters It's just not possible. Unless he doesn't have enough anti-air, you have a lot of but I don't think that's fair This actually might be a pretty decent engagement, honestly One blighting cloud would help a lot, Loco No, no blinding cloud But yeah, this engagement obviously is very good It was a non-steached army You see a lot of the terran units are still kind of just set around the map as well Loco just killed his way This was a really good fight, honestly I'm proud of him for that I mean, he does have a big army supply at this point His back is is growing lower and lower, he's not even really maxed anymore Ultralist does go down. I feel like the many play styles he's trying to mix isn't really working It's like, you know, you ever have these guys that, that ask you for advice, the people that go to the chip, and they know what I'm talking about And you have like a friend who wants to. wants to start as well and he asks you for advice and you just tell him it doesn't really matter what you tell him right you tell him hey like you have ever heard of the 5 5 or whatever like the strong lips it's like a decent program like people are gonna make games with this kind of stuff you know and your friend does one workout of strong lips and he calls you up like Kevin this strong list up isn't working for me my bicep didn't grow 5 cents here you're like well like maybe give it some times like no no I'm trying something else I'm doing full body workouts eight times a week He does two full body workouts. It looks in the mirror It's like, my chest isn't the size of Arnold Schwarzenator yet That's an issue here for me And I'm like, okay, well, just try to stick with a plan Maybe he's like, no, no, no This is this, Gap I got something new I'm going to be running three times a week and then I'm just going to be body weight as well at home And I think this is the key I saw some videos of calisthenics guys and they look insanely buff And I'm like, all right, good luck Like, just stick to the programs. Like, after two calisthenics run out uh workouts and half a run he decides to call it quits and he tells me as bad genetics and can can never actually become big that right here is what loco is doing he switches composition into composition without actually sticking with it or following the game plan with it he started with well hydro corrupt hydra corruptor which isn't a composition we're going to skip that part then he goes into hydra viper which actually was working reasonably well he just wasn't executing it very well He wasn't doing the exercises, the correct way He wasn't having the proper nutrition But the plan was good He was trading He was doing a good job. He was winning the game very hard, I think, at certain points Then he goes into mess banling But once again, he didn't start with that plan And hydra banning, or well, it's not really supposed to be hydra bainting With reverberger bane is a composition where you play on high momentum So this is not the time to use that plan anymore The time for that plan is way past Then that doesn't work He's like, ah, crap, I'm losing all my workers Let's just go a fighting army But he doesn't execute the fighting army correctly He doesn't have the investors And that's the issuer He just keeps switching plans and he never is growing his muscle. And then he complains to me that he has crap genetics No, you don't have crap genetics Just stick with the plant, man It's better to stick with a crap plan and to keep switching between decent plans without actually completely executing it This is the random mule that we're waiting for When you have. three circling and you see twelve mules drop you're like all right we're gonna be in trouble the next minute and a half that's a good run by though there's one thing that can be said about loco is that he's quite patient with the way that he sets up uh i was going to say sets up engagement as i say this literally runs in head budding this mac army with ling hydra corruptor to blood but before this he was being pretty patient with setting up engagement He was very consistent with his run-bys, with his things That's one of the things I do appreciate in this game where he is playing pretty well. But yeah, it's just not going to be enough, right? Like, honestly, the game is way closer than I thought it would be With the mistakes that he's been making, I stopped counting strikes, but we would be at about five right now at this point So my Adder can just add a fifth one right now Just a quick jump He would be in jail twice already It's like life You're never coming out, love It's over for you Baseball, he would be at the bench again If Loco would be playing curling, he would be in trouble as well This curling is a very technical sport Nothing to do with the three strikes, though Corruptor just flying around Loco is busy admitting defeat. He's taking a sweet time for it I actually like that he's staying in, though I mean, he still has pretty decent income, right? He has 67 workers doing good damage There's not that many planetaries anymore Like this is just a regular base, which means if he can somehow stop this base, he could be in good shape I don't think he's going to be able to stop this base because he literally only has Ling Bain But you could see a world in which Loco would have won this game Perhaps had he taken the red or the blue pill Sadly, Loco decided to take the green one Lurker still down in the pressure I think this is the first time I see a lurk. Oh no, at least kill it, please look Okay, there we go Lurker gets a kill, dies five seconds later No coming out Dang it Freaking range of these tanks are so broken Here we go, headbutting into 12 tors I mean, it's not gonna work Now, it would make my day complete if we can get a little, a little bit of a flame in a lot Just tell him how broken Mac is Come on Loco is too nice for this kind of stuff That's the problem Too nice Lurkers get burrowed Do absolutely nothing Kill half a hell, but the Tours march him Literally a right-click lurkers Loco, loco, loco This is a man in disbelief Tried everything That's the thing. It's the same with the gym, you know? He tried everything and it doesn't work My friend, stick with the plan Loco, you sent me a Twitter DM, not even an email, a Twitter DM, complaining that Terran is too strong Vipers died to Tours Brutlords died to Tours Ultras died to everything, and investors require your opponent to suck and not scam when they move out I don't quite know about your opponent, but you definitely didn't play too well this game You did not play too well Your Brutlords did die to Tours. vipers did die to well actually I'm not quite I think your fibers matter died to turrets your army composition was incorrect your your your idea your general concept of high workers and then taking semi-efficient trades denying bases on the outside is a good plan but really try to stick with it a bit better your your your viper control could use a little bit of work your consistency of trading you kind of want to when you play like this you want to really cut off a part of the map where he can't be doing counter attacks like I said with that static defense that you definitely have money for and then all of a sudden if you're only focusing on the army you have at hand you can think about making rotations to two sides where his army isn't and that's that that's really just it I mean you played a decent game but Mac is not Mac is not in balance my friend you you just wait what I think I have some better guys to do this for me. Let's go, boys Hello, Loco, I've come to conclusion that you suck Loco, you suck, man Loco, you suck Loco, you suck Yes, yes, you do suck, Mr Loco Alright, that's gonna be it for me today Before I go, please thank Loco for his cooperation with this series Don't go flaming him that he sucks That's not very nice Finally, we have someone else that actually wants to do a video with me and then if you guys go flame him and make his life miserable, that would have been nice So please follow him and do his stuff on YouTube Like he's actually great He's a great lad I absolutely love him. I also have my stuff, but thanks so much, Loco, and see you all next time. Bye bye. Thank you."

        "text": "Dear Harstam, I'm a big fan of your YouTube channel and a regular Twitch viewer Even your knowledge could not guide me to victory in this game though The Zirk plays extremely saved the whole game, pool first, very late Fort Base, and yet he never falls behind in any way It is impossible to attack into this play style because they have too many units in the early mid-game, and in the late game there is creep everywhere I am just not allowed to move my army or expand until I inevitably have to spell out Gigi Thank you for showing this imbalance to the world Aki Welcome to another episode of Is It Inba or do I suck where we have Aki from the. I hope he's from the UK Or maybe it's just because the letters UK are in there But for some reason I believe him to be from the UK The server at least is Europe So from now on this guy is going to be British Our boy Aki in the Pickpan It's, I believe, the clan of PIC, another content created A lot of the people that send him replays to IOTES have been in the pickpan They all sucked so far So I hope Aki might be able to change my mind on everyone in the pick pen But so far, every single one of them has sucked So we're going to see an SCV scout He sees the pool first. Like he said, pool first, late fort base And yet impossible to attack into this play style, which, you know, those are big claims Those are big claims impossible to attack into a play style Now, it's not very often that I hear something like that, because every playstyle, of course, has its downside Now, I'm also curious to see what the playstyle of the Zerg is going to be Like, is it going to be something revolutionary that we have never seen before? Is it just going to be standard link bay muda, hydrabane, perhaps? We'll have to see a couple of links, of course We'll be able to shoe this SUV away Let's have a look at the build order here of our, uh, of Mr. Aki here he's going to take a fast third command center On a map like submarine, a lot of the time you'll see a faster second gas around 220 You don't see the straight command center as much Factory goes down Yeah, refinery Makes a lot of sense, honestly It's such a small map Roach rushes are quite common This is one of the better Terran maps, though So a lot of Zirks will actually attack on this with like an early Roachal Inn or that kind of stuff So Terran needs to be a little bit afraid perhaps get an early tank, or play Helium Benchie is also fine, of course Two links are on the other side of the map already Reeper stays at home. Wait what? What happened here? So this is something I've never actually seen before The way you're supposed to play, if you play Barracks Gas, is you play or Reaper Marine, then Reactor, and then you can just swap the factory, but he went for two marines I'm not quite sure, but this is not the build order as I know it It's just a small difference, but just something to keep in mind First Mew goes down, Starport starts as well as Stim on the way A little bit of oversaturation in the main and not a lot of scouting info yet here, right? right he doesn't really quite know what he's up against mr. Aki he's going to move out with the first two halions of course afraid of run bys as well as he knows there's links out on the map already doesn't know quite where they are 30 C should come down soon then we're going to see how many cars it's going to be is going to be four is it going to be six perhaps even eight well he's playing bios so most likely not going to be eight most likely just going to be six cars or four cars actually looks to be four cars and then we'll see a command center go down, followed up by two barracks, most likely SCV production looking solid indeed As the four aliens keep moving in, 30C comes down. There's quite some creep being spread already Nothing really has been killed so far, two tumors Just a very standard game, honestly, for a start. Viking starts working at things and we have Ovalour's scout coming in for della beta bit of a supply block well not a bit of a supply block this is a big supply lock all right this kind of thing actually matter this is a full supply block is what I like to call it as he's full supply block he also loses two aliens but that won't actually get him out of the supply block he's still pretty supply blocked you see his SDVs in building so you should have had a couple of more SUVs already like the full supply block is basically when you only start the depots after you've got supply block so you hear the we need more supply and then you go like oh crap we need to build decos rather than the anticipation so that's going to cost you most of the time in scev and a half right every single time that happens so we could have had a little more workers already and we see double ebys on the way no worker production on the natural starting at 520 i think we should run a timer for how long cc's don't build scevs here because that's actually kind of a big deal you feel like he might have missed some earlier as well main also not building so that doubles up the timer twice the speed right now ebays are starting i mean this is the type of thing you see a lot right people are confused as to why they can't kill the other guys like oh he's playing so safe well you're not playing save you're just macro and poorly right now as well you know like so the other guy can play as safe as he wants as long as he's just spanning his larva in some kind of way um he's kind of gonna be fine all right as if he start again we'll keep the timer on the timeer on the just in case later on they'll stop building SCVs again which might actually all right this is triple Jesus that's that's really bad actually if you have triple cc's and you're not producing anything with any of the orbitals that's not good now there is a build where you get triple cc's and then just use the mules but with that build you build four barracks at the same time so you cut workers very early four barracks at the same time and then you try to hit very hard with one one and five barracks production really early. That's not the case So it's definitely a mistake here We see the halions have achieved truly nothing Three helions died, killed eight lynx, Ovalor died to the Viking, and three tumors have gone down So, I mean, he's still pretty much in the dark as to what's happening here His first move out is going to be a little bit late It's floating eight, nine hundred minerals So is the Zerk, but we're not here to judge the Zirk player We're here to judge the Terran player So The question is, hey, what would have happened here if he actually would have spent this money? Now, we can translate this money perhaps in, well, what is it? 15, 16 more Marines, something like that. That probably would have been quite helpful in this army Well, quite helpful Probably would have just straight up one in the game Of course, it's not a one-to-one translation money to Marines, but I think at this timing, he probably could have had 10, 12 more Marines, two more meta-facts as well What? Ah, this is the Goody Way So there was this famous Macing Terran who used to trick people that he actually had good macro and he did it by building CCs or queuing up four units at the same time and he'd only play Mac as well Good old Goody Yeah, this is not how you're supposed to play But I still prefer this over floating the money. So a lot of the time people will just be floating 500 resources It's still better to build something with it, though it's like tricking yourself that you're macroing better But I don't really mind the extra CCs That's fine That's completely fine So actually our Taryn here is in a pretty decent position He has a decent amount of units He has tanks in nice spots He can scan some of these creep tumors away Now the thing we're really missing is a lot of workers though This army gets cleaned up But that shouldn't have been the biggest of you I'm having difficulty finding my words here because he should not be at 51 workers at 9 minutes. If we compare this to any other pro game or just any game in which nothing happens to the economy, I think we're going to see a Terran that's going to be at least at 65, maybe even 72, 73 world with the Ford base probably already going and saturated I've seen innovation play games, definitely with Bio, where he's up to 80 workers at this point already This should be flowing towards the Ford base and be building into a planetary This should be being built into an orbital Two is on the way, which is fine We see no second factory yet. So the way you want to be playing in TVZ is usually whenever you're building a fort base is that you play five racks, five racks, second factory, and then you go, well, you get the second factory while you're building your Ford base You don't go six racks So this one is a little bit late It's not the biggest of deal, but just a small note Also he hasn't done any harassment whatsoever, very common in this matchup is to do the frontal push and then have a drop on the side The boat clear creep there and to make sure that the Don't do that please And to make sure that the Zerk is a little bit distracted. Maybe you can do some damage, you know, you can clear Crete at two sides at the same time He completely stopped his tank production and he went straight into drilling glass Now this is the sign of someone who has no clue what he's doing and just copy the pro player, which I'm not even necessarily Oh, decent splits I can live with that I can live with that Probably should just move back, though I don't think you can fight, but the splits weren't that bad So what I'm trying to say here is that he's seen a top player go second factory, drilling claws, and mines, and he gets the reactor on this factory as well. But that was either against Ling Bain or Ling Bain Muda If you're playing against Hydra Bain, you'll see almost every Terran, 99% of the Terrans will play tank They'll make many, many tanks because tanks are really, really good against Hydra Bain in general And that's how you want to be playing Now, sometimes they'll still throw in a mine here and there to deal with runbys, but in general, the main army composition is going to exist out of tanks Because tanks are just extremely powerful against Hydrolysk because there's no mutas on the way You don't need Tours The mines are okay-ish, but not quite as usual because hydras can outrange them. Of course, now, once again, we have Aki moving a little Coofark forward, loses another army basically on Crete She reaches up two liberators Floating a solid 2 6K minerals and 12 minutes into the game, don't forget, first we were at 53 workers, and now we're already at 61 workers And I think that was at the 8 minute mark So he managed to produce 7 workers, off of 5 orbitals in 4-9 four minutes, in four minutes So that means per orbital that is about one worker per three minutes Now that is very impressive because you know that you can build five workers per minute with Terran So I'm just a little bit confused exactly how he thinks his opponent. I mean if I was him and I wouldn't pay attention to building SDVs either be confused, like man, like my trades aren't even that bad and he's playing so safe, like his fourth base was super late Man, like your third base is barely saturated Your fourth base hasn't even really started yet Like, it doesn't really matter how late your opponent's fourth base is if you're never getting a fourth base in general It's like complaining your opponent doesn't have a third when you're one base all innings Like, mate, he doesn't need to You literally have no workers Like, what are you going to do here? Well, the answer is absolutely nothing Mines are being spread. Liberators are out as well, which I'm not the biggest hater of Liberators, but I feel like it's a bit too soon, you know? Usually you see Liberators later on in the game once the Terran has a good position, a decent tank count, and perhaps starts thinking about Ghost as well You see stuff like Ghost Liberator But in this case, I mean there's just a single tank Oh, we're actually going to be seeing a drop Now this is kind of intense Fly straight into the Overs here Nice Oh wow Is that a French voice? Amazing So we have, what you call it? Advanced ballistics on the way as well Another double drop heading out right now And actually he's doing a fine job macro. Like he's spending his money a bit better than the circus The circus flow We're floating 6K resources and our UK Terran is only floating 4K resources So really he's doing a way better job when it comes to that Of course he's also mining less So the rate of spending is probably very similar Now we actually have two drops on the way and this is where the multitask of the Tarran comes in Let's just have a look at the famous Tarran multitask So he's maxed It comes the first macro Seize that it dies gives it up Fair play now Actually, it gets a little bit of damage now That's good trade Good first trade Second part of the army. It dies, but it gets a hatchery All together Pretty good Pretty good, right? Pretty good trade I'd be happy with this if I was the Terran, honestly You killed the fifth base Once again denying one of the outside bases Absolutely destroying the Zerg Zerg actually has What the hell? Why does he have so little supply? He has a lot of Banelings and he lost all of his Hydras just now I just love this move out There's not a single Medivac with this army There's two Medivacs coming back now Liberators are still just defending this part So there's like 30 supply defending this area Then there's 30 supply defending this area Nothing is defending the fourth base. So any type of run by Woodwin would win He is right though, there's infinite creep And there's infinite creep is because he hasn't one tried to actually kill some creep I don't think he's actually Look, how many tumors does you have? Like, maybe 15? He has 60 tumors killed Jesus Creep is broken, guys I mean, he killed 60 tumors and the game still isn't over That's actually surprising Look at this This little 4 2 P-K Zerk player over here, literally better creep spread than Sarah That's quite something I think Uki might be onto something The creep? No, I was gonna make fun of him for not killing too many tumors, but damn boy, was I wrong Actually, nothing has happened this game, though. Aki is literally playing the campaign, and he's angry that the AI has improved so much, and he can't beat the AI anymore There is missions where you just need to hold on against waves of Zerner And that's pretty much how Agi plays latter as well He's like, alright, what's the next wave? You know, and he tries to craft the perfect army to do with everything like Marine, Marauder, Liberator, mine, single tank, no planetaries, but I want more money for mules And then he just keeps holding back wave after wave after wave after wave, and he just hopes that he gets to win eventually, that the Zerk takes such a bad engagement, that he can counterattack without really having the micro ever again. I've been flying forward some solid joinks, but Honestly, once again, I don't think this was too bad a fight for Akki Like he just, he clears everything He finally has his fort base up He right now is mining from one One and a half base Literally one and a half base So, no matter how good his traits are, he's always going to be in kind of a crap spot, right? So no matter how good is traits are, he's always going to be in a bit of a crap spot, honestly Like he's mined out his main, his natural, his third is about to be mined out. So he actually mined a decent amount of minerals, but he's just always going to be bases down, as long as he doesn't get to clear any of the creep Because what Della Beat is doing is he's just taking base by base, staying on a pretty low worker count as well But at least he's always going to be able to get bases basis I mean, if you compare it with Aki here, who is having trouble establishing a fort base with an orbital command It's just sad to see that like three, four tanks here would be super helpful Or seven, eight tanks would be super helpful as well. Or even using all the mines you have in the back or the mines that are at your army just burrowing them You know, there's so many things that are going wrong here that's really quite painful to watch I mean, he's just wasting so much supply on things that shouldn't be happening Once again, no matter facts at all Like every single fight, he just stays until he loses every single unit And he's like, okay, I've lost every single unit, now I'm allowed to build a new army again And he starts basically from scratch again Every single time, it's super frustrating to watch because it makes absolutely no sense as well. It's like, why the hell would you play like this, dude? It actually makes zero sense The way you want to be playing is you want to try to preserve as much of the good units from your army as possible if you realize you're losing a fight Like you can just fly back with the Metafix, right? Kiti is building more liberators, nothing else Floating 4K minerals, 900 gas Now you could say sure the Zerk also is floating, but I mean, Zirk has worse units lost but just mine more resources And still has a pretty decent army How many larva is there? 20-2 larva This is one of those things I can never understand. If you have the larva available, yeah, you can just spend them Like the injecting is the hard part But, sorry, back to the Terran Another command center could be helpful to maybe try and take a fifth base here with a planetary at some point Like a double drop over here I mean, there's a couple of spines, but you could just kill that Should be no problem You have three, three marines The one problem that Yuki, that Aki has over here is, of course, that he has no meta-vex So any kind of pressure is going to be with marines that are completely overstimmed, with liberators, which will be spotted a mile away, because actually the entire map is covering creep. Seventy-chummers have died so far this game I'm actually, honestly, quite impressed Seventy-seven creep Creep might actually be too strong I'm leaning towards it, guys If this guy, who is a 4 4K player who can't spend his minerals, is building this much creep, it might actually just be too powerful My boy Aki here has been working hard on killing the creep Sure, he doesn't have no matter of fact, sure His macro hasn't been perfect Sure, you forgot to produce SEVs for the majority of the game Isn't really getting gas on the third or the fourth base And I'm sure there's a host of other problems with this play, but the creep man, it's massive. Oh, here comes the classic marine mine run by onto creep by onto creep Big Stim How many more times can he do this before they just fall down due to exhaustion? Oh, one more scan Here we go A couple more tumors Wiph Mine shoots No, does not shoot If there were metaphics here, perhaps you could have picked it up That would have been real nice, actually Two more Vikings on the way right now I feel like if you realize you have to build this many air units, it might be one. wise to just throw down a second starboard but then you know he would actually need to take gases oh he does it he realized it as always I have wait a second I only have four meta facts playing against eight broodlords and tanker rafters perhaps the answer would be to get gas because right now I have zero gas mining and I be an issue I'm not sure if this guy is trolling or not You mean what is a big fight here? I don't even know what to say This game is so good The banics will roll in There's no micro whatsoever Gigi. I mean, I'm not sure if Aki is serious, right? Maman Aki, first of all, what we need to work on over here is the first minute and a half, or the first two minutes It's some weird builder I didn't like that very much Second of all, what's up with the SDV production, man? Get it together You're building no workers, you have 3 cc's, you're slow as crap Third, the way you build your structure, double cc, late second factory, six racks before 4CC, no gases on the third base, unit composition, where were your tanks? You can just get ghost if you see vipers as well No EMP or snip, whatever you want to do that enhanced shockwave, it's really easy to hit. So against Hydra Bain, you could just play like tank lip, a ghost or something like that You're going to be absolutely fine, my dude But yeah, tanks are good Like, if you are getting mines, use them rather than having them to defend a third base with 14 mines and 4 liberators You could use sensor towers as well Don't forget that You could wall at your third base, which is helpful You should take gases at your third base You should multitask You completely forgot the clear creep whatsoever Well, okay, wait I catch myself once again That's actually not true because you did try to clear creep, but there was just too many tumors. Now, that possibly could be, and this might just be a suggestion, that you were literally playing the campaign Like you actually never attacked You were just defending wave after wave after wave And I'm telling you, even a gold or, well, in this case, a diamond player, is going to have the best creep spread in the world If he's going to just be allowed to sit there for what seems to be 30 minutes straight, Like, he just literally said there, is all right, you're not going to clear my creep or you're not going to move on the map or distract me in any type of way, all right, another tumor, another tumor Like, this guy had so much time. He was just slowly taking bases He was, you know, he probably was doing other things at the same time, honestly Like, you were sweating over there Sweaty, micro and Marines forgetting to build SCVs, and he was feeding his kit, man This guy was having an absolute blast So, yeah, altogether, yeah, you suck Suck pretty hard That ain't too nice Alright, if you did enjoy this episode of Is It Invar Du Oursok, don't forget to subscribe to my YouTube channel up there And otherwise, check out some of my other videos over here Nice."

        "text": "Hi Harsden, I'm a Diamond 3 Terran player Today I played versus a platinum Zirk player No matter where I moved on the map, the Zerk army was always able to find me And I wasn't able to harass his bases due to this I was ahead on upgrade, but this Zirk player was able to shut me down completely No matter what I tried, the Zirk's ability to gather information is too easy and overpowered Either that or the Zerk player was cheating And I accused him of this in game due to frustration Is this player cheating? If not, I believe this Zirx ability remix, their army, and together information due to decrease red and overlord to be far too easy and overpowered. So the question is it Inba or do I suck? Thank you, Anonke All right So is it Inba or do I stop? Welcome back to a new episode As today, we have a replay from a Terran player who truly believed that not only the Zerk player might be cheating, but also that if he isn't cheating, his race is overpowered I like that he said that, you know He's either cheating or his race is overpowered So if we actually find out that the Zerk is cheating, then his race apparently all of a sudden isn't overpowered The ability to remix as fast as possible seems completely fine at that point to Anonke. So he is a very interesting way of framing things in his head, but I'm very curious to see I think part of the frustration as well for Anonke here is that he's a diamond player and he lost to a mere platinum player, right? so it hurts the Evo a little bit and then of course if this guy is a different race then you definitely have to get him so we're going to have a look at the build order that Ananke plays so he plays command center first barracks refinery second depot there's absolutely no need for the second depot when you play command center first I'm not even sure if you should ever build the command center on the high ground. I don't think so Maybe against the 12th hole, but that's not even a build You see that the depot did nothing So he wouldn't have been supply blocked This is the beauty of the command center first is that you can literally just wait for your command center to finish It allows either for a faster second gas or just allows you to gather a little more minerals with that first SUV So factory off position, but I guess I can live with it This is not really a builder, so I've seen I've seen build orders before, but this is not one of them Throws down a mule CC finishes up His opponent is playing some. I think this was a pool first with really fast speed, which also is not much of a build order, but You know, we're here to focus on one man and one man only, and that's Anang Cave Still has the CC in the main base at this, I've never seen this before No scout whatsoever No Reaper, just straight straight to cross cars and then CC in the main base I don't even know what this would be good again So the reason why you'd get the CC in the main base is if there's like a Ling flood or something like that But it's absolutely no clue what's happening So you can just keep the CC at least in the natural. You know, there's nothing wrong with that You use it for extra mine It's going to be slightly oversaturated now Factory and barracks should switch over here. and yeah should oh by the way the things we're going to be looking at in this game obviously are the first question is is this Zirk cheating because to me that seems well after reading the email it seems very likely that the Zerg is cheating so we're definitely going to be having a look at what Ultimate is doing in this game and second of all is the ability to remix overpowered from Zirg so we see four buildings going down at the same time here two extra barracks to ebays at the 350 mark, before he gets the units from the star part, which is going to be the Viking That's not really a thing you do. So a majority of the time, what you'll see is you see fast third command center, after an opener Like, it is a reactor Oh, this is not all you're supposed to do, my friend This is supposed to be a tech lab so you can start stim. So if you get reactor first, in order to get stim and combat shield in time, you're going to need to get two tech labs but in tvz you want as many marines as possible so you get your tech lab so you only need one tech lab and then you get two reactors on the outside barracks so you get more marine production it's denying some scouting so far ultimate has seen the entire base knows exactly what's going on so he has good information due to scouting i i don't think there's any hacking going on yet here i haven't at least i'm not quite aware of it couple of supply blocks perhaps, but hacking not yet Anonke has done absolutely nothing this game. He left all of his halions at home And even though he's been keeping his halions at home, he's been getting supply blocked So it's really quite impressive He's focusing really, really hard at the double tag lab This is a classic This really is a classic Like, oh, you get Stim and Combat Shield at the same time But it really limits your marine production going further along in the game as well. Yeah, the problem with what he's doing is he's really focusing on the macro and then he's failing the macro as well, which in that case perhaps it's just, you know, it's time to realize that you're not the greatest player in the world, maybe cheating at nothing to do with it as we are approaching the six minute mark. We're also approaching the thousand mineral mark here in this game. Ding, ding ding ding! Annount K has reached a thousand minerals. Congratulations. You can collect your price of minus 35 MMR in the shop located at the end of the venue. This is the kind of stuff that is an IOTIS classic at this point, right? Player complains about Zerg Remax ability, floats, 1. 5k resources at the 6th, what is he doing? Hellions don't shoot up my friend They don't shoot up That's a proper Roofing mistake right there I think he's just actually F2ing around the map to look for overlords And in his mind, he's doing a great job denying scouting Oh man, this guy has absolutely no clue what I'm doing Like, I killed like, how many did he kill you already? I killed three overlords Like his scouting is going to be terrible Meanwhile, his opponent actually, all he really needed to see was these three barracks before a third command center and he's going to be pretty fine We take a look, however, at Anonke's visions. He's the only thing he's aware of is that there is a base at the third location I'm not even going to say there's a third base because he doesn't know if there's a natural All he knows is that there's a base at the third location And you could say, well, it's way harder for Tarrant to Skild, which it might be true, but it's not like Anonke tried You know, he ran once over here with his helions Then he was like, oh, there's a queen Let me just move that back I don't want to be there no more, guys I don't want to be there no more As Anonke is really kicking up the production here a notch. He's going into, I think, seven barracks That's good to two starts as well This is kind of solid fourth base is on the way as well And Creed spread is slowly but surely pushing forward The good old seven-minute lift towards the third base is also a modern-day classic Anand-Kastil blissfully unaware of everything that's happening It's the ostrich approach to Starcraft If you pretend that there can't be anything happening, then there probably isn't There's a lot of good examples of this, of course. Back in Wings of Liberty, there was a Swedish jerk player called Forsen, who invented the thing called the Forsen Mutas, where he would ostrich is really hard into the mid game by getting five bases and 10 gas without scouting, without building a Roche Warren, and just praying that the Protos player wouldn't attack. And if the Protos player wouldn't attack, this guy was the absolute best Mura player in the world, because he just had like a 45 drone lead and he was always going to win you know and then if you're immortal in dim or he did any type of pressure he would lose the game and he'd flame you so either way he'd never had the responsibility of uh of losing the game on himself you know either he completely out macroed his opponent having way more workers and you know with with good mind games or otherwise he'd just flame you so truly was a win-win for him um don't think he plays the game anymore i haven't seen him around in a while while at least. What we do have is a couple of mutas and these were no force and mutas as our friend Ultimate has been scouting around He gets two Metavex over here His upgrades kind of suck though which might be an issue here for Ultimates There's some decent micro Quite the opposite of what our friend Ananke is doing here I'm not sure what these guys are doing He's having a blast standing over here Bumpidum He's dealing with the mutilisk a little bit He lost a couple of workers, not too many. So I actually think Ananka, even though he scouted absolutely nothing and his macro has been pretty horrific this game, he's still in a playable position, I feel like he has way superior upgrades, his 2-2 is about to finish, while his opponents 1-1 is about the finish Really the only issues I see is that he's not aware of anything really going on Upgrade, complete It's really the kind of guy where his wife tells him that, you know, she's making over hours at the office and she comes home smelling of a different man every night And Ananki is like, yeah, it makes sense, you know But there's loads of men working at the office. Every time she goes to the late night office, you make sure to do her makeup, puts on her lipstick She comes back Her hair all messed up And Ananki is like, oh, good work at the office And right, yeah Great day at the office the office That's her boy Ananka for you right there Completely unaware of anything that's happening in his life Except for what he's seeing right in front of him and those are those mutaliskas We now have a flank coming in which it's not really a flank, just the entire army about the bum into Ananke's army You see some nice micro-ing into a position I'm not sure if that was an attempt to split or what happened that. An interesting fight to say the least He loses absolutely everything to a couple of banings And he's done I mean, he's still had a decent supply, so that's what really gets to me, you know? He has two to upgrades He's losing a lot of SUVs, but he's actually been doing a decent job compared to his opponent building workers I actually have some micro coming out of Anante as well, which is the first time I think this game we've seen him do that just control his units rather than just stimming and standing still Very, very interesting 3 3 is about to finish up 54 more links on the way here for Ultimate, who. Oh, I completely forgot that we were looking to see if Ultimate was cheating I mean, I don't think so yet I've seen nothing that indicates cheating He took a fight after he saw the Marines move out of position He's actually been scouting pretty well the entire game Ultimate hasn't been spending his money too well, but the one thing he's been doing extremely well, has been scouting, he's been completely aware of everything that's happening His upgrades have been a little bit late His muta control hasn't been perfect, but you know, really he has been spending a lot of effort into scouting, and Ananka has been spending a lot of effort in walking into corners, just walking into random locations on the map. It's really the wrong thing to do Spelling after him Yeah, he's going to lose a lot of SVs once again He's just, oh, that's a big mine hit I mean, he does have that going for him Like, I, it's very, very weird why sometimes people believe that they deserve a win or just anything, when they're really not doing something related towards working to towards that goal So the main occupation of Ananke here seems to be walking into corners He walked over here earlier, then he walked here, then he was in the corner over here And I don't understand how he believes that entitles him to a win It's a bit as if your job, wait what? A psychic cheat Fricking abracadabra over here. I was about to have one hell of an analogy Let me tell you Imagine your name is Ananka and you have a job You're an architect You're supposed to be, your occupation is drawing I'm not sure architects They draw and they make buildings and stuff like that And you want a promotion, which, you know, you've been working at the company for 12 years now And everyone except for you has been getting promoters been getting bigger jobs. You're confused as to why you're not getting because after all, the thing that you've been doing to work hard towards that promotion is every day you bring in four different types of coffee and you have a little coffee tasting with all your colleagues and you force them to do it Hey guys, I got four new coffees every single day for the past 15 years you've been doing it Every time you have one of these promotion rounds, you go up to the board of directors or there I've been working really hard. Like I've been bringing coffee like four different types of coffee and the coffee tastings you know and everyone's been loving them and the guys are like what it's like yeah like so i would like to get a promotion it's like well like you mean like two drawings in the past four years like don't you think you should work more towards that's like no no no like the coffee though like i think that's really really important that's like my friend ananka that's not what is how it works you know just walking to the side of the map into a wall does not guarantee you a win what we need from you to do is we need you to control your You need you for once in your life to scout. I mean, literally your opponent could be on two Always going to my army of creep without vision You've never moved on creep You've literally never were on creep How is he supposed to fight on creep if you never go there? You've got to be kidding me Overlords? No It's cheating How is this possible? He would see them with his meta effects He's making good points I mean, if there's one thing Ananka has been doing well this game is making sure that there's no overlords around Are you seen every corner of the map here, my friend? Catches Ananka out of position again Once again, completely cut out of position How is that possible? I mean, if we analyze this situation, really, quickly. We see that Ananka has his army positioned smartly in the middle here, where he's defending nothing So this base, he's a bit close to it, but it's still vulnerable This base is extremely vulnerable The main base is vulnerable to Muras as well So the three main avenues of attack right now are vulnerable But in Ananka's brain, it would make more sense for Ultimate to just attack straight here Like, why doesn't he just walk up the ramp? Well, the explanation for Ananka here is It's very obvious It's because this guy isn't It's an obvious cheat How else does he always catch his army out of position? Sometimes over here, sometimes over here, sometimes over here He's always there where his army isn't. Except when he is when his army is Then he's cheating for finding the army No matter what Ultimate does, he is cheating And it shows in every move that he makes I think we should actually grant Ananka this because I didn't think it was that obvious before, but now I see it. as well guys I mean he always fights off creep which you know that is indicative of cheating for certain reasons which I cannot share here because you know you don't want to give away all your secrets but as a cheater hunter to me this cheater hunter this seems pretty clear cut to me honestly once again rallies straight into his opponent's army like he knows where it is you know what I mean here Gifting him 30 40 links for free Would a non-cheater do that? No I think Ananka figured it out He's still up by the way He's absolutely winning this game 3-3 upgrades against 2-2 There's no Muralis He has 40 workers against 59 And he's about to drop like 35 mules. So if he wasn't super oversaturated in his main for so long, I actually think this game would long be over already Oh, we're gonna see some micro here I'm not quite sure he'd consider that micro, but he moved so much of his units So it's progress of a kind as well, right? If you compare it to previous fights where I remember this one he just stood still, but now there was some movement I'm not sure if it was intentional or not, but we at least saw something happen there He has a mine spread around the map as well He's still winning, by the way They literally double the army supply They actually doubled the army supply There's no bailings right now. He has nine metaphics and he's better upgrades The thing is that Ananka doesn't know any of this because the last time he saw anything on the other side of the map was at the four minute mark with four Hallions and then he saw a queen and got scared back to his own base How many mines does he have 40 mines? He's alright quick prediction here He's going to clump all of them up and he's going to get killed by two bathings I don't actually see how he can lose this game honestly If he spreads the mines, I feel like the mines would just be able to win this as well It's literally just links There's not a single bainling at the moment. There's four on the way 25 Marines, 9 Madovacs, 3-3 upgrades against 2-2 Like he's absolutely winning All he needs to do is make sure that the mines participate in the fight The only way he loses is all of his Marines die Before he reaches, he overstimped a little bit as well Three stims Oh, my Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm Oh no Stim's army four times, his own mind shoot it Still all in a club, by the way It's going to cancel this way He's still in a spot where it Like, honestly, it's just. just impressive you could give this to an actual caveman and he'd still be able to win this i think like he's he's not in a bad spot guys he's not in a bad he still has mules and everything like he's mining like a madman he's a couple of SUVs doing nothing he could be mining more even he's going to pump up like the the marine the marine production air oh my god once again ultimate with a run by here it triggers the mine losing only 15 links per mine that's something definitely a map hacker would do So Oh, look at this move Ah, come on, man This is not a report that Let me grab the email again I kind of want to. What did he complain about? No matter where he moved on the map, the Zerk army was always able to find me, and I wasn't able to harass his bases due to this? Is he really going to pretend like he was trying to harass anything here? He moved out four aliens at one point That's literally it He did nothing else He was ahead on upgrade, but the Zerk player was able to shut me down completely no matter what I tried Like, guys, I moved into four different corners and every single time my army got caught by 35 balings Like, not only is his cheating, his race is broken I don't know, I know You can be serious. This, this, the worst part is that I believe this guy is actually serious Sometimes I get emails where I'm like, all right, this can be serious, right? The email is too much But this guy in the game flames him as well for cheating So, I mean, you did absolutely nothing, right? Like your build order was terrible You never moved on the map, never cleared any creeped, did zero harassment You didn't spend your money You forgot the micro every single time Your unit movement was actually the worst I've seen in a long time Everything you did actually just was terrible So for me, you're going to get two stamps First of all, you suck, the standard one. Second of all, you're an idiot for thinking that your opponent act Because this guy definitely wasn't hacking He just was better than you and I mean that's if everything that is better in you is a hacker that's putting the bar very low my friend so two stickers for you congratulations if you didn't enjoy this video don't forget subscribe to my YouTube channel up there otherwise anything more like this in the bottom here Patreon Twitter all that good stuff bye bye."

        "text": "Hi Kevin, I have something a bit different for you today We already know that Terran is in balance, so no need to beat the dead horse on that one But, I believe the map submarine is even more imbalanced The insane short rush distance, super open third base with a tiny ramp to high ground, I've only gotten two base pushed on this map Now this guy decides to push with five tanks off two base and a crazy amount of bio How is it possible on this map to hold such a push when I know it's coming, but he can arrive instantly and set up an insane position I got Arconnes and Charged Lot out quickly for the push, but it just wasn't enough. Master 1, 5K MMR, NA server Thanks, Lone Wanderer And here we are in the game With my friend, Lone Wanderer All right, Lone Wanderer Now, let's have a look So you already assume, you assumed that Terran is overpowered I can live with that, you know, for now We're just going to assume what you said. And then afterwards you say that the map is broken So you say the third base What did you say exactly about the third base? Third base with a tiny ramp to high ground. I mean, this isn't really that tiny, but I think he's taking the wrong third guys Okay, so this is not the right map to take because, well, there's an insane high ground with a ramp there. This base is way easier to keep I'm not even sure how he thought that this was the correct third base, but that's irrelevant for now as we're just going to have a look at his opener, see what he does exactly what he does exactly And then from there and now, we'll see if, A, if Terran is overpowered and B, if tank pushes are too good on this map Submarines are a difficult map to play I'll give him that I don't like it too much against Terran myself I still think it's better than some of the maps, but it really, it could be worse, honestly So we see him building one too many probes. You're supposed to get 20 Cybercore, 20 Nexus, 20 pylon, and you piss off back with your probe You start a probe and then a simulator at 21 Now it's going to happen is he's going to build a pylon probe while you forgets this probe and then you're supposed to build an assimilator after but Yeah, I don't know it's not it's not great if you have your cybercore in time You're gonna get a small supply look in this case, but I don't think he had a cybercore on time so perhaps it's fine No, cybercor was a bit late It's okay for now I can live with it. He opens with stalker Usually you go into warpgate straight away because you're not playing Stargate if you open stalker, but I guess maybe he forgot I don't know We're not going to be too nitpick Even though this guy is pretty good, right? Masters 1, I think he said, 5K MMR That's high level stuff, it's high level stuff No, it's a Twilight Okay, then in that case he definitely should have started his word bit That's actually a very big error He starts scouting around because he saw full wall I appreciate that he's doing that I think it's definitely a good call His opponent is opening Marine into fast factory reactor more Marines That's nice I can't live with that. For how safe he is with scouting around He's really not that safe with his unit movement I mean, if like a Reaper comes by at this point, he doesn't have a second unit, still no start on the Warpade That's actually really quite bad If he gets blinked before Warped, I'm gonna be real upset So he gets a second gateway That's a good timing for a second gateway He chronobo boosted the third unit You never have to do that, honestly He also sees the second gateway also sees the CC timing, etc So he's going to be completely fine He gets a robo. So this means either DT drop or it means Robo and then blink could be the four gate if he hadn't forgotten Whartgate We can also just be three-gate blink honestly Okay So he gets Robo and blink before Warpgate I'm not going to be too mad about him forgetting WarpGate, right? Mistakes happen and and that's just that's just something, you know, that just that happens Mistakes happen That's it, guys That's it Leave him alone He tries his best He's 5K MMR on America So he gets a third gas, no fourth gas, indicating then he's going to take a fast third base I guess over here. It's important when you play this build that you get very fast observes and you use one chronobo boost on the first observer Second observer stays at home I even like to get one battery in one of the bases in case you're playing against Benchy, especially if they play either gas first or barracks first Marine That means there are any kind of tech is going to be a little bit bit faster He's not chrono boosting this Third base goes down, so he's going to be going into charge slots behind this The third gate is on the way Where? Over here And he has started his warp gate at this point. So him actually missing the warp gate in this case is not going to be that big of a deal because he's playing against banshees Still hasn't chrono boosted the second or supply block It's a little of a nasty supply block, honestly It's not that nice Yeah, it's not great We see What's the opponent actually doing? Opponent, well, he was going to do a five tank push, if I recall correctly, is what I meant Now, Benji is coming in, is going to get spotted by this pilot, so Should not be too much of an issue to deal with, right? Observer could just come into position Where are the I don't think he saw it Okay, then this is really going to suck Robo Bay. Okay, so this Benchie is doing a lot of damage, which that's really bad already This is why I usually save one battery What? Why would he I didn't have energy here Okay I can live with it He probably also could have just started an observer and be done already, but What was it? Nine kills Nine kills on the Benchie Now, the reason this me off this robo bay is because now he's not playing a proper build order anymore Whenever you play robo bay you need to take four gas before third base and get a robo bay Otherwise you just can't afford all of this All right, this is a bit. So the reason why it's important to follow build orders properly is because otherwise bad things happen Like he's just not going to have enough gas for any of this basically His Colossus is going to start way too late against a regular three racks, he would have died as well Usually you're supposed to have two colossi against that He's barely going to have one Now this is a bit like imagine you're a cook, okay, and you're going to make a tomato sauce for your pasta So you boil the water, you put in the spaghetti, start chopping up the garlic and stuff, you know, your onions, maybe a carrot, like a stick of celery, whatever You throw it all in there. And don't forget making some tomato based sauce, right? You fry it a bit And then instead of using the tomato, you use horse poop so you throw in the horse poop you know put everything together you you spin the thing you know to make it all real small and then you serve it to your family your family goes what the hell is this is well it's tomato sauce it's like no that is not tomato sauce what you're doing here is not blink Robo Bay this is horse poop mixed with garlic my friend that is the real issue that we're having right here because you're not gonna have enough enough gas Like, if you're following a build order, you need to follow it properly. You can just use some of the things that you think might be good Like, if you're following someone else's build order, your thoughts are pretty irrelevant You're just going to be using that until you're familiar with the build order, and then you can start thinking about changing things You're not going to be changing how much gas you need because you're always going to need more gas You can't afford anything, dude Like, you're struggling to get a first colossi out You can't even afford thermal lens yet Your first colossal, usually a three-rex push, hits at 6 30 6 30 You have 7 units He has 21 Marines This is nothing to do with the map. You could be playing on Earth, and this guy could be playing on the moon And he would still be in time to kill you, because you just have absolutely nothing It's just You also took the wrong third base I knew that after I read your email, obviously Like, how is this possible, dude? Like, you have no units You just build nothing thing Oh, press the wrong button I'm back Oh I'm gonna keep this in Armour, charge A cannon because, okay, like, look, I love cannons Don't get me wrong I think they're great against mind drops and all of that But you just scouted a dude building like five tanks, right? You saw it with your observer. Like, you know he's on two base for now Like, like, you're, you know, he's on two base for now Like, your priority is not getting cannons Your priority is getting more than three units out in the next five minutes Like the first seven minutes haven't been too hot, my friend Like the next seven better be something for real I actually, I didn't even completely mind this You know, there's not that many marauders If you know how to guide, if you had gas, well you have gas now, but if you had gas at the time for thermal land, this is not a move, I think I can think he can just kill you. But no, no, okay, he's just going to set up his blue position You have vision over here You might want to keep the vision before we go into an engagement, right? So you see kind of where the tanks are positioned Now, what you're doing here is, first of all, you need to get thermal lens It's very important with this build order I like this flank, though This is a good flank You might want to sync it up with the rest of your arm, though Hey, you'll get two things, but this is not supposed to happen, man You got to be kidding me You're lucky this guy I wasn't paying attention I would have thanked you for this move No thermal lens yet. You keep your observer here You think that having detection around your colossal is going to be more important than seeing his army move with my friend I don't think so You actually had a decent hold despite everything Not because you did anything right, but just, you know, sometimes even clowns get lucky It is where, you know, the gambler wins the jackpot or something like that You know, it was a bad decision to go gamble, but you won. like it's some weird type of fallacy I think not sure which one you guys in the comments can figure it out now no vision whatsoever what's happening you don't even know if he has a third base or not just casually taking a fort I don't mind you taking this fourth base by the way because then you can transfer your workers away from here you don't have to deal with this position anymore okay so you meet them in the middle randomly you have no vision you get shelled down lose two colossi for free lose three Closai for free And this is it Do you send me a 9 minute replay? I really should start checking how long replays are Oh no. Four tanks in position Maybe this guy just sits back for a bit You can get a game out of this So you start a Colossi or He was not on 2 base You told me he was on 2 base I was expecting a 5 wrecks, my friend This guy is just macro He's getting plus 2 and everything Just doing a couple of pushes here and there And you're down 40s play This is one hell of an engagement Yeah up the ramp in a choke I'm confused who led you in Grand, or in the Masters One League, my friend. I feel like we should keep a guy at the gate, just like they do what happened, you know, so we have someone to blame if someone like you get let in Like, holy crap dude This is very, very impressive You still have absolutely no vision Okay, you have a little bit of vision of his army now for once Like you'd be, no, are we gonna go? No vision of where the tanks are No, just going It's working out I absolutely hate that this is working out because, okay, this makes me happy then that he's gonna do a drop here That's good What you're doing here, imagine, imagine you were a soldier in the army and I'm the general. And after a while I'd get a call general I have good news and bad news the good news is I know where the enemy is the bad news is in order to figure it out I had to get shot like the way you're figuring out where your opponent is is by rushing into an area then you meet them you go like ah okay his army is here now I have to decide whether I actually want the fight or not most of the time it's already too late you're like seven tank shots um you're already in the fight no no real decision making beforehand just oh oh crap I guess I guess we're fighting now Some casual chilling here. I mean, there's actually no hurry for you to do anything anymore Despite all your shortcomings, you actually managed to get into a game somewhat Like, you're still behind, or well, you're still, you're behind now I'm not a massive fan of this attack, though Into a siege position Once again, you do the same thing, you know You get shot in there. I think you're like oh I guess I should have been here you just like 15 supply they realize it probably wasn't the fight to take then we have I mean you know four base it is you're in trouble man you're gonna need disruptors or something at this point you're gonna need secondary secondary tech you're gonna need to start harassing with zellats you're gonna need some damn vision on the map my dude look at this move so I I we almost missed I almost missed this though we've been so sad so this guy so first of all we have this move right he pulls back loses 20 supply we've seen this then you see this single marauder on the left side have HP 1-1 upgrades zero vision on the map okay we have we have some vision here what does our hero decide to do stances his entire army to the left side entire Sorry, look at the vision, look at the vision. No clue what's going on Pompiom Kills the marauder, moves back over here Still no clue if the opponent is siege here at this point Is there a drop coming here? Is there a four drop coming here? Like, no clue As I was ever just moves across the map again No clue if there's a run by I think, man, this guy is absolutely loving life Hey, that's an interesting EMP And this is a good run by I appreciate that I actually do appreciate that That's good stuff, dude I'm proud of you for that This part, I'm not quite sure if Proud covers the load here, right? Lose your entire army for it feels like the fifth time this game. There's a look like seven Colossus Five Colosses have gone down How can you be losing traits if you're playing Colossus? That's not really a thing, usually, my friends That's really impressive I am I'm truly impressed, yeah You can say that You definitely can say that It's a good run by He gets a couple of worker kills Problem being, of course, that he has no units on the other side of the map He's fighting against two-two upgrades, while he himself only has plus one armor And I think this is going to be it This was a good replay, though, man I love it Masters 1, 1 America That's just absolutely great Absolutely I can really master's one That's very impressive. I guess our hero is going to stay in front. a bit longer here he's down a hundred supply me might as well try right still has the annoying base with the tiny ramp up didn't think of clearing the rocks either you know after being pushed here seven times with that these rocks they you know might might come in handy later on in the game haven't really come in handy but definitely would have been handy to kill those big mulege i don't we're just going to skip through this a bit like he's he's really just wasting our time at this point we we don't want that long one there You've already wasted my brain power, you've made me mad, and now here you are wasting my time as well I am standing for it. So a couple of EMPs, good Viking Shultz, and Gigi gets caught Now, quick look at the email once again, right? The map is in balance The map is difficult against Darren, I agree, but not because the third base is hard to hold You just took the wrong third base Your build order was worse poop Let's not forget about that. your micro was interesting. your vision was non-existent. your unit movement was I'm sure interesting. it's quite as rare. I haven't seen that before the way you decide to move across the map the the confidence you had in your army despite it being terrible. I also find something that was great you know it's kind of as if you would go to the auction house for like high level art and you show like a macaroni painting you know you had to glue the the macaroni's on the paper i remember doing that when i was in elementary school that's kind of what your army movement felt like. i just honestly like the map really isn't like it's bad but it's not it's not imba um and Terran also isn't imba my friend you just really really really suck all right that's going to be it for today if you did like this episode don't forget to subscribe to my YouTube channel up here I have other things up there and more over here which you can all click so thank you very much see you all next time bye."

        "text": "Hello Captain, I'm an up-in-coming Diamond Zerk showing immense talent Some of my friends even call me Cyril Jr However, ProDos is just too imba for me to make it to the big leagues The Forgated Depp with War Prism is just so broken I don't know how it hasn't been removed from the game yet Adepts can just teleport around your base on repeat, with seemingly zero cool down After you finally think you've recovered, the shimmery boys just waltz into your base, wreaking havoc Immortals are OP versus roaches, and ravagers are just weak please help Kidder Kit Alright, Kid or I will refer to you from now as Cerell Junior or Junior I think Junior is just fine. So the claims here are going to be Forgate Glaive Adept is too good The shimmery boys, which I assume to be either High Templar or Dark Templars, both of them shimmer a bit, are also too good Roaches, I mean Immortals are O-P versus Roaches and Revedgers are just weak Just weak, you guys So that's four claims right there I'm going to be able to remember probably a solid 25% of them So I will be focusing on the claim for now that the Furgate Glave is too powerful Now, Forgate Glave is a good build It's a build that has been used a lot in the past few months I made a guide on it, a couple of months back as well. I absolutely love this build I think it's a good build order It puts in a good spot against the Zirk, but there are certain responses from the Zerg, which have been pretty well figured out over time, as is usual, if a new build becomes really popular And the way to respond to it is, I've alluded to this before, is you stay on a single gas with a crap ton of links You get a spine at your third base, and then you get a roach war at some point They start producing roaches from a single gas You have a lot of links, five queens, and once the roaches are out, it becomes pretty easy to actually deal with the adept. So first of all, we're going to check how the response of Kidder Casor Jr is against this Forgate Clave And we're also just going to take a look at his unit movement, his overall drone count and his follow-up responses, basically That's going to be the main goals here So far, it's looking pretty tight I mean, he's a diamond player This looks all fine He knows how to play the game His opponent, who almost messed up the build order It's still messed up the builder He almost messed it up and then did mess it up in the end But that's okay We're not focusing on him for now And it's actually not the biggest of deals with this build, a complete order of buildings. You can randomize it a bit So, this first adapt is gonna be too late I guess this is a Nexus Earth or something I'm not sure It doesn't look like it You just forgot to build an adapt So our man Jr gets the scout in, sees the lack of a pylon I saw the second pilot over here, so he knows the only location for tech could be here Decides to just let the tech be, what it is, goes into the main with four adapts or four links and no defense Decides to just walk out again Yeah, he should be scouting Okay, yeah. He could have done this with a single or with two links earlier, but I mean, this is kind of okay as well, right? He gets the information in the end He knows it's the Twilight Council There's no about the robot follow, but I think he can kind of guess it So the best response here would be is to drone up to 44, 45 maybe in this case, because everything seems a little bit late from the toss side Then just start producing links, five queens, roaches, you got your one guess Okay, well, this is a mistake But if you have the natural on the natural rather than it being blocked, this actually is kind of okay as well. I don't even mind this too much It's poor I am not entirely sure of he saw the complete lack of a dark shrine at like 3 30 Dark shrine takes 71 seconds, which it hadn't even been built yet, if it ever is going to be built So that's at least, what, 70 seconds, would be like 4 40 when your spores need to finish, not even adding the warp in time and then walking So like at five minutes So this spore is way too fast This port is way too fast By a solid 30 seconds and it's a small thing, but it's still a detail that does matter. How the hell did this guy get here? Wait what? Is there a prison? How did he get here? There's no walls? Now I'm curious This is all fully walled? This is fully walled? There's no prison? What the hell? This is way more interesting than the rest of the replay Let's go back I want to see this The rest of the replay can suck it honestly What magic trick did this guy use? Where's your stalker mate? Oh, he warped it! Well, it's slightly anticlimactic I'm not gonna lie He really got me good for a second I didn't know this could reach That's ridiculous Alright, sorry I just absolutely mesmerized by this stalker. I thought I saw a magic trick happen in front of my eyes I once had a guy do this with rope while I was eating at the Ike with my parents When I was like seven or eight, this guy had many tricks with the rope and he did make it go together and go apart And I remember it, wait, what is this? Oh, there we go And I remember just being extremely mesmerized by how to do it and he just wouldn't tell me this guy Like, why would he come up to my table, show me all these tricks and don't tell me how to do it? That's a weird flex as that to do That's a problem with magicians. Got a guy in high school with it as well Came up to me a deck of cards and then start doing tricks and not actually how they were like I didn't ask for this but at least if you're gonna trick me explain to me how he did it absolutely ridiculous magicians I love man this stalker is great I love this this is a big play now remember what I said about the proper response to this was going to be single gas roaches even without a layer but honestly this hits so late that I don't even mind that he has a layer but there's no links he only has four roaches at the six minute mark. He has no clue where the prism is coming from exactly So he needs to respond now Eight adepts in your base So a couple of things that are wise to do is probably to pull away the drones Even if it's only temporary, yeah, this is a good move Yeah, this is exactly it You don't even send them here, you just send them to the site And then once the adept shade out, it's all good You see the adapt shade, you split off half of your army to go there Otherwise, If you send away your whole He's attacking the pool I'm not a massive fan of that move, but it is okay. So so far the defense hasn't been brilliant, but it hasn't been too bad either, right? We mainly see some poor control here from the Toss as well who is focusing too much on roaches Okay, yeah, come on guys Let's keep our head in the game Let's keep our heading in the game Yeah, there come the roaches You split up your army, perhaps? No? Just keep keep running in one ball All right We're just going to be following the roaches I mean we'll see the worker count go down So Here, here No Guys, hello? Are we paying attention as well? Don't split up Yes Oh, oh, oh, here come Oh, gone again Oh, come on, guys Do the other side. Right now we have 21 roaches against seven adepts, perhaps a 7-7 split in every base or just half splits One following the shades Oh, there we go We're following the shades Good. job guys come on come on come on here we see follows the shades for the first time kills all the adeps I wonder if you realized that this was the that this was the trick you know that perhaps the movement wasn't too brilliant here or do you think we're gonna see more of the the previous movement where he moves his entire blob of roaches to one side that's like oh crap he shaded to the other again here once again we have the roaches oh one massive blob here we go guys cancel no finishes If only there was a way to deal with four adepts if you have 30 roaches. Like my friend, my grandma has more fluid movement than you have and she's 90 Like just split your units It's really not that difficult It really is not that difficult Adepts finally do get semi cleaned up Except for these four I guess Here comes Roachman again He's still building drones, by the way It's a fifth base or fourth base already Plus one is done Like, please cancel, yeah Hmm Hmm What is he doing? He thinks they're in the prism Oh no This is like a guy getting tricked by the coin behind their ear for the 20th time in a row I got a freaking coinette He keeps feeling his ears again and again. And the magician isn't sure if he's still like, if the guy he's talked to is an actual idiot or if he's the one being tricked It's like this guy with the adepts, like I know he has 35, like he's 37 roaches and I have five adepts Like does he not know that the coin is behind his hair? Like it's just in my hand and then I pull it away They're like, man, must have so many coins behind my hair No, my friend Like, imagine being a drone and these are the guys in charge of defending you You're working your entire life, mining minerals Just once in your life, you want something like, this guy is absolutely pooping his plans. He's seen all his brothers die while the guards just stood there, like looking around where the shades went this time Like, just split guys where with 40, like, It can't be this hard These are the absolute stormtroopers of this game already Like they don't hit a single shot He's still not in a terrible spot Like he needs to do some damage now, but he has plus one He's up like 30 army supply There's nothing here for the Tulse who already is taking a forward base as well Like this game is completely over, actually Yeah, this is actually a game I was supposed to desert. yeah this is i mean in okay in so i guess in theory this is his game right he's up 60 army supply and upgrade this base is completely undefended this base is completely undefended this base there's an immortal and a war pin it's sometimes a bit tricky to get into to to walk up into ramps like this so i'd actually suggest killing all the workers for free like if you think of the rewards at the end of the trip here right so basically here, this isn't too difficult to break, but let's make it a bit extreme So here you have, you have climbing Mount Everest And at the top of Mount Everest, there is a suitcase with $100. And the other thing is, like, you need to walk to the park And not even to the park You need to think about walking to the park And there's a suitcase with $150 And this guy decided to climb Mount Everest It's like, I'm not sure if that's the play, my friend Like, I'm, I'm actually, not sure if that's the play Well, I know that's not the play So you lose all of his roaches He did manage to equal up the worker count not because he killed workers, but just because he's been building drones It's building an infestation pit as well He decides that plus two perhaps isn't necessary as. Is plus one finished like a sort of four minutes ago? I love the oversaturation as all That's a big play They work harder when they're together, guys them drones okay prism falls up 60 army supply still so perhaps oh the ravagers are out and here okay shivory boys are gonna be dark shrines I guess or the dark templar dark shrines four dark shrines on the ravagers just moving across the map uncontested I'm not gonna I don't yeah no roaches with it just ravagers I love it This is the first time he split his army when he's attacking It's brilliant Who attacks with 11 revergers and leaves 23 roaches at home to defend against nothing? He just literally gifted his opponent like 2,200 resources. Like here you go my friend I guess he's not going to lose all of them This is actually the sick What? That was a beautiful move I love that Guys, we've escaped Alright, let's go back Oh man, if this guy was in prison break, the show would be way worse We made it out of the prison guys and then he just knocks on the front door again Can I be let in? Oh no Oh, that would be a terrible show Junior, what are you doing here? Wait, did you Did you just attack your own roach? So some high-level cannibalism? Okay, this guy, what's this guy doing? Hi, Chief It's my soul mate There he goes, turns around. Um, where was I with my brain? I had a great analogy coming It's okay, it'll come back later Plus two finally on the way Builds a bainling nest No upgrades for bainlings, though workers, 1800 in the bank, up 60 supply So even though his entire early game was executed by someone who seems to have a single-digit IQ, he still is in a pretty decent spot Oh yeah, I was wondering who his friends are and how they think he is Cyril Jr Like if this guy is Cyril, then, like I have no clue what I'm going to be but I'm a lot better than this guy with my assert What is this movement? He just walks through immortals The recall? To the 4th. Oh, to defend Okay, yeah, I like that That was a good move Yeah, that was not a bad move So what do we have here? Yeah, just entire I mean, Immortals, I'm sure, are extremely strong if you never attack them Like, he actually has doubled the army supply I'm not saying, you know, I think he actually could win if he just fought with his entire army against the entire army of the other guy The thing is, he never seems to do that He didn't split one time in the early game, and now that he doesn't need to split anymore, he keeps, like, only standing in half his army and just move commanding through immortals, which is absolutely bonkers to me. I don't even understand why he would do that Like, in what world is that a good play? He's still maxed He's transitioning now Plus three could start He's on Hive, right? Yeah New Stage with Hive Lurker Dan Sixty-one workers Or 63 I mean, he could build a couple more, but he could also just fight for once Like, the thing with roaches, they get so much worse, right? After a while and you just need to use them Like, the moment you hit maxed or you hit a good power spike, like you just got to start using them Like, you can multitask There's no defenses here You can send three here, three here and then your main army kills this base. Or you could walk up a tiny ramp without any vision, luckily managed to get up and then start fighting into immortals Like this actually could be a pretty decent fight The way you want to be fighting this is you want to be stutter stepping forward to kill immortals What you don't want to be doing is right-clicking this while there's a bunch of immortals on the right side Or attacking with a what is this move? Oye, there's 12 detees, let me just warp all my units into reverber so they can't fight anymore Oh no Oh no The glimmery boys, the shimmery boys are just wreaking havoc in my bases The adepts destroyed him, the immortal's own roaches And then he doesn't have detection. No detection He still has the spores from early on Sport was built at the three minute mark These sports are like the guys that comment first in the YouTube section I know there's a couple of you do every single time I absolutely love it And spores are the same These are your soul brothers friends You guys saying first The best part is there's going to be a couple of guys in this video saying first and they're going to hear this later on They're going to feel a little bit ashamed of what they did That's okay I'm glad you are. Like this absolutely has to be one of the worst losses and the thing that pisses me of is is if you think back of what he said is he said that Glaive adapts and then Immortals was it? Oh no no Gigi no Gigi no Gigi Oh no, a rookie mistake Cyril Jr without the Gigi I see adepts can just teleport Shimri boys just waltz into your base Immortals are OP versus roaches and ravagers are just weak All right, this guy, imagine you have these people that work for the firefighters And they have to investigate why a fire started If Aram and Cyril Jr here was one of those guys. like the fire inspectors, we would be in for one hell of a rough time, honestly Like, he'd find like a handful of mattress and a can full of gas And you'd be like, huh, perhaps it started with the microwave It's like, mate Like, this is arson, like this, the guy is over there He's like two cans of gas sneaking up It's like, yeah, I think we should definitely investigate like this, this weird looking sandwich here It might have caught fire in the oven or something and I say, mate, that's not the reason Like, the reason you lost is not the glaver death Like, you have no clue. Like, the reason you lost, hey, you move like an idiot and you never split your roaches Why? Why? Why don't you just split your roaches for once in your life? You only start splitting your army once you're up 70 army supply, you could just right-click probably his nexus and kill it. You went into his natural when his third was completely open, his fort was completely open, and his army supply literally consisted of an immortal and four stalkers he just worked in it was like 12 like five stalkers you just maybe had like a salad somewhere or prison I don't care like it's actually insane the opportunity you had to win this game were so big for the entirety of the game even though you lost 35 workers duel but seemed to be like 10 adepts while you had 35 roachers like I was going to complain about your build order being bad and it is bad like it sucks I already give you that and then on top of that you still had enough units to deal with his pressure. He had 37 roaches to deal with seven adepts And you managed to always be at the base where he wasn't Like, you could literally hold position 10 roaches in each mineral line, and it would have been fine Like, that's not a way to defend this, but it still would have been better than whatever abomination of a defense you just did Then to follow up, you never scouted, like not once You had no clue what he was doing you're just, and you kept building rogers and raverages You were floating like 4K resources You forgot your plus two You never had an overseer with your army. And then in the heat of the moment, as you were getting killed by DTs, you morph your entire Roach army into ravagers And then you left without GG Because this somehow was in balance, man This is nothing to do with imbalance You're just ultra bad Oh wait You suck I forgot up the premise of the show for a second Like, the things you've done to my brain here is like, incomprehensible I have no clue what happened, but I have difficulty thinking normal thoughts If this lingers for the rest of the day, like I'm, you're in trouble, my friend, you're in trouble I'm seeing you in court Like, this is actual brain damage you caused to me. And you didn't even have to be in the same room Like, I absolutely pity the people right around you your friends your family man that must be rough what a roast what a roast and what a time to hit that like button right now don't forget to smash it or uh johnny recco will come and build spines in your natural thanks everyone for watching i hope you did enjoy it don't forget to hit that subscribe button up there there more videos in the boxes that my editor made the time some time ago that's cool see you all next time bye bye I'm."

        "text": "Hi Harsum, I want to show you my game against Broken Race I destroyed his hatchery with my proxy racks, was harassing and doing a timing attack pretty much all game And he still won, because he defended with Bealing printer and tacked up to Inba Ultras, so while he can just aim with his army, I need to micro as a pro gamer, like me Isn't this unfair? Thank you, Alpha Blomann P S I know that I should build ghost against Ultras, but I'm not Maru to go control them all right alpha blomann 4. 4k tearing player I think from America masters start with a proxy 3 racks since all of his works a little bit too early and place his barracks on 40 now I'm not the proxy rack master but this I haven't really seen before the the 14 14 14 I guess this is an extremely aggressive version of the of the three racks where you actually need to kill workers as well because you see only he's going to have 14 workers which means he's actually going to have a pretty bad time if this if he doesn't kill drones on top of the hatchery I think like you you can just I don't think you can cut this many SUVs and just be content with killing a hatchery but I could be wrong it's possible I've been wrong many times before I'm going to be wrong again and that is just the way it is Bim, bim. Some things will never change So we see pool first from sanity He's also going to get a roach warren So probably I already had this plan that he didn't really manage to scout anything It's a pretty old build order by sanity, but I can live with it I dig it And I kind of like it against this, honestly If you would have gotten some links early on, like two or three pairs of links, this actually would be a free win for him Now, funnily enough, even though he's going to be. rushing the roach war it's actually not that great for him it might you might think hey this is great it's going to get roach against marines but he's actually going to get the roaches a little bit too late so bunkers will be up already and hatchery will most likely fall especially because he only has a single gas so it's not going to be able to pump out three raveragers immediately i think it's just going to be like two ravagers actually he's getting a lot of gas fast maybe he will be able to pump out three ravagers immediately but i think the hatchery might be down already at that point this is a really bad call he should not be put in drugs but I'm here to criticize the other guy so let's let's stick to that shall we so you have continuous marine production or almost continuous marine production no SV production okay it starts now as well so gonna go up to slightly higher work account and at this point to me it's clear that alpha blombam is going to be able to kill this hatchery right so at this point what he should be doing is he should start probably gases and just have continuous SV production that's going to be to be the two main concerns for in here because right now at this point 304 minutes the game is pretty much done like for for the initial phase you know the initial phase is done it's like okay a single valve hit two marines and aces i didn't even know that was possible i bet alpha bloman had to try real hard in like the unit test map to make that work one has the way for me to get as much damage as possible. This is like one of those games Like a carnival where you Every game is a price, you know? Like sometimes the price is pretty crap You get like a little Barbie doll or you get a stupid plushy, but at least you get something Every single time this guy throws a bile My mind, Alpha Blomman, just stands underneath it So you actually stop producing workers altogether all together He lost two workers last time I checked He's mining eight guys in the minerals and he has five on gas I'm glad that he has units on gas, but he should have, he should be like 21, 22 STVs at this point, even with losing the workers. So you forgot to build like six, seven workers, I think That's going to get command center It should be getting a factory ASAP because you know there's going to be a counterattack, right? So you either want to be getting a banshee out or a quick cyclone Some of the command center should be getting a factory ASAP So you know there's going to be a counterattack right So you either want to be getting a banshee out or a quick cyclone Some Some So you're something like this To me and probably many of you guys this is really, really obvious that you are going to need some type of attack He builds the factory while he already has a hundred gas, extra. So he could have literally built it like 20, 25 seconds ago Orbital does finish up On top of that, he also sees that, I mean, there's a lot of ravager So if I was him knowing, I'd probably build a bunker here or a bit further back Just somewhere just get a bunker to make sure that you can actually defend your ram If, well, these ravagers eventually are going to be a breakthrough So at that point you're going to most likely need a bunker It's a tech lab Okay I wonder what he's going to get with this Oh, maybe he wants to swap the two That makes a lot of sense, actually. You should sell this bunker and run back home with the Marines at this point, most likely I mean, there's not a lot to win here anymore for, for him an alpha Blaman Oh, it's gonna actually get another ravager That's nice for him But from here and out, it's actually better to fight at this point, you know? Maybe you would be able to get one or do some damage to them It's not like you running away, it's gonna delay him very much Like, it's actually just gonna leave them alone Anyway, so right now we're 22 workers It's pretty much what we should have been last, like a minute ago Because we have a tank straight coming up I like that as well. Bunker is a little bit late, but so far, honestly, Except for the For getting the SEV production, the game still looking pretty tight here for Alpha Blom-Mond Right? He's up Eight workers He has a second base already His opponent does not He's scouting with a barracks He sees absolutely everything She's drones pop So he's now, okay Well, I know what this is now Let's see what he's going to use this thing for He's still only mining with two two SUVs in gas This is a pushback as well This is honestly looks quite good for Alpha Blomon Not really producing any SEVs anymore though for some reason Oh, there we go Starts at least one up again Yeah, I like it. Liberator comes out now You can use this Liberator for two things, either to harass the opponent because there's only going to be like one or two queens, or you can use it to try and push this guy away But honestly, I think once you have two tanks, you can just kind of leap from your tanks forward and you should be absolutely fine, right? Like you can probably put one over here and then move down with your Marines or something like that Like if there's one on the Yatch over here, you can put one over here as well It should be completely fine Seems to be exactly what Alpha Blommon is going to be doing and I like that. I think it's actually good moves I'm trying to touch some Bileshots Hello Can you see this one up, Chief? There we go I think Alpha Blomond so far, except for a few small errors like the slow transition Yeah, it's actually playing a pretty decent game. going to get a third cc as well um it's going to get a nice little supply block all of that is kind of okay the most important thing for him here is that if he gets this base up just starts mining and then he does some counter pressure right like he has a he has a pretty nice lead at the moment in in units at least so he should be using that real quick so i don't like this liberator too much I think the first one was fine for harassment if he would have used it But instead it's just idling over here This is when the shift click can come in handy sometimes You can just shift click things up. It's going to do some damage And he still has a way better army, right? I would love to see a couple of metaphax being produced now for the next move up Now at this point, if you're Alpha Blommann, you have three tanks and 15 marines Stim is about to be done You probably just want to move across the map and kill your opponent Or at least going to be forcing a lot of units Like the only thing you can really build is roaches and links And you have Marines and tanks So generally that's a good fight for you, especially if there's no upgrades For Alpha Blumen also has no upgrades Right now we have 74 supply against 30, uh, 46. Triple Cc against, well, a third hatchet that's later There's still some harass going on I mean, this guy's been absolutely godly A lot of damage, I'm gonna die to a spore Haps to the best though, you know, I'm not gonna cherry pick like that So we see a pretty big lack of SUV production here I'm not a fan of this Is he aware of the spire? Yes, he's seen the spire We're seeing an eBay come up No double eBay, which confuses me Definitely should be double eBay One SUV, two, three SUVs in production There we go This is what we want Probably want to start getting some turrets out as well Throw on a couple of mules Yeah, exactly. get or go up to five barracks at this point That's going to be the main concern here for Alpha Blommann who, by the way, said he was harassing constantly I'm not sure if that one Liberator counts as constant harass and the timing push I really haven't seen a timing push from him yet, but we're going to keep that in mind You know, the timing push and the constant harass, as my man Alpha Blombon said, should really be fine He's still not building workers. He's still really far ahead but a lot of the time what happens in lower level games is that people get ahead in one thing and then they completely stop doing the others it's a bit like and then they they think they deserve the win it's a bit similar in uh in relationships you know where very often it's guys who do this they'll buy flowers like once or twice at the start of the relationship and then and then whenever the girl was like man you never you never do anything spontaneous for me they guys like you remember in in early 2012 in March I bought I bought roses for you a bouquet of flowers it was like yeah it's like 10 years ago dude that doesn't count anymore you need to you know you need to keep going and that's kind of what what my man Alpha Blomann is doing here he he's bought roses once this game and his girlfriend has given birth the seven kids since then they haven't gone out to eat once together he hasn't even told her that he loves her that's what Alpha Blomann is doing and now he's confused why his his relationship is falling apart oh my friend it's time to buy some roses tell your girlfriend you love her very important Alpha Blomann also in Starcraft of course you need to keep going man. You can't just trust on one thing to do Like he's still ahead but you need to continuously be making moves You can't just stop building SUVs for five minutes and then hope that you're still ahead No, that's not how it works One good move in a game isn't going to win you most of the time unless it's a very good all in That's something you have to realize alpha That's something you have to realize I've been loving the timing attacks we've been seen from Alpha Blombone as well by the way This is the classic loose three three tanks to to seven Mura Lisk is a good timing It's really one of the classics. I once bought a book in 2012 called Classic Timings in StarCraft 2 and losing three tanks to eight mutas at the 11 minute mark is one of the first chapters there So I'm glad to see Alpha Blomann knows his classic literature when it comes to Starcraft Here comes some of that constant harass once again So we had one Liberator at eight minutes Now we have one Liberator at the 11 minute mark He's really pushing the boundaries of what is humanly possible when it comes to multitasking, being aggressive in the game I'm very very impressed by him honestly Alpha Blomman is showing me things that I didn't know were possible So there's like 11 mutas out at this point. Now something that's nice to do against Muras is to have a dedicated force to just deal with the mutas and you put them in the least defended base, you use, usually the main base You put like eight marines and a medevac here and eight marines and a medevac are going to be able to deal with like literally 15 mutas Like you will die if there's 50 mutas but you're going to kill like seven or so That is a classic Pretending like you can't see if you're shooting Nice Take a look at unit loss Unit loss is pretty even We actually for some reason have sanity kind of coming back into the game 52 workers actually continues upgrading. Alpha Blommon has a pretty decent army size, but these upgrades are very slow Only played single eBay There's no armory on the way, no second eBay This upgrade is about to finish up Here come the eight mudas These guys have been keeping Alpha Blomond at home, right? Like Alpha Blomond really hasn't been doing anything, except for that one liberator Turrette goes down Another supply block Take a look at this reaction time Hello, maybe want to deal, send a meta-hack to deal with these muir, no, no Send in the SEVs They might be able to repair these muralists out of the game A sacrifice to desert gods, so to say It's absolutely brilliant, my friends This never worked for anyone in history, I said. I know the timing push And this timing push is hitting harder than some I've seen in my time Mine's in the back, not going to be participating in the fight until it's over, most likely Oh, decent mine hit Uh, it actually was a nice couple of mine hits, but I feel like the micro might have been a little lacking there There was no real tank support either I'm not the biggest fan All of a sudden, Alpha Blomman actually is behind I have no clue how this happened This is switcheroo of a lifetime Units lost, he's far down Oh, he's a bunch of units in the main It's making sure right now that at least the main is protected. Alpha Blomann really is good at the tunnel vision He's the king of tunnel vision, you know? Okay, right, the problem last time was in the main base So if he comes to the main base this time around, I think I'm going to be fine However, the natural Oh, yes, I'm in the natural And the third His tank is a little exposed, but Yes, he has some units everywhere Let's see how my man Alpha Blomon is going to deal with it Okay, armory gets stopped, which is annoying because the upgrades are going to get really, really important this game do two finishes, ultra less cavern on the way, you know? Then you know you're, it's important to get the upgrades. Like right O, big link vein run by So this is the reason why usually you leave the main army at the third base and you have the small squad to defend the main base Basically, the ground units can just teleport into the main base, but the mutas can bounce So the only threat to the main base is the mutilisks Links can't be a threat there So you don't need to have marauders and six metaphax in the main base That is not extremely useful, usually Basically what Alpha Blommann just did, imagine if you have a house and you have a small tool shed next to the house. And in the tool shed, there is a hammer and there is what more than a tool shed? Nils A hammer and nails It's a terrible tool shed And what Alpha Blomann does is he defends the tool shed with the newest security system The Marines, the marauders, the mines And then he has his massive villa in which he has golden bars Because Alpha Blomann is a wealthy man I mean, he's doing timing attacks the entire game, constant harassment This guy has to be rich But the house with the golden bars, you know, he only has a cat to defend it. Then his golden bars get dropped and he goes, oh, how is that even possible? How is that even possible, Alpha Blomann? Especially with the constant pressure you're putting your opponent on there That does sound a little bit in balance, doesn't it? I'm feeling it as well, Alpha Blomann 36 workers, by the way He's been doing a good job not producing those for a while now lost 24, but so has his opponent Did he scout that there's a hive? No He really has scouted nothing He also, oh, this armory Can we get a little timer of when this armory gets stopped? Because I can't quite remember I want to say it was somewhere around 14 minutes, but that's a good timing. Oh, solid move command into the opponent's army Always gets me going a little bit, at least Just slow down the replay Nice one, Kath This jerk is actually controlling his units very, very well I like that Yeah detonates all the mines Goes in Oh And the balings connect All right There's an ultra as well Clean up duty Clean up on Idle 2 As a Oh Well, very unfortunate And you might be thinking, how does this Zerk survive under a constant aggression? I mean, we've seen a liberator at the eight minute mark, a liberator at the 11 minute mark I think we saw a pushout with like 12 Marines and three mines and a marauder at like 12 or 13 minutes. And now another attack at 16 minutes Like how does this Zerk even manage to get up a drone count this high when there's, like this Zerk only has like four minutes to take a breeder in between attacks and harassment? How is it possible that he managed to push this out? That's what Alpha Blondman is thinking right now Armory, oh, finally being rebuilt, this guy's a hero I can't wait to see the eBay start working immediately, because that's definitely what's going to happen Actually losing a planetary to links Nice Man, these milas have been absolute heroes I guess he rebuilt them a couple of times, eh? 80 milas have died, yeah, they've been rebuilt a couple of times Oh, there's another counter. Oh, this is a base trade scenario right now What are we seeing here, Alfa Blonde 1? Not ready for the base trade But these are some nice units on the other side of the map Sadly, these units are literally cavemen fighting with sticks Well, the other guys are You know, right now they have swords and they're They're actually researching the gun technology You see 3-3 Chateness play thing My man still has 1-1 Armory finished finally at the 18-minute mark Single eBay not researching though And here I take another great position and my mine shot's absolutely destroyed But I have one ultra. Sure the Ultra might have five better upgrades than me and my army consists of pure Marines, not even a single marauder, but I should be allowed to win I kill this hatchery with my tree racks I never laughed so hard It's almost a sneeze Like this was This is so sad This is the saddestory, 2800 gas, so If it was a prolos player, you could warp in a lot of high temp I actually still have a chance in this game But because he's Terran, I'm not too sure about it My man's sanity just keeps expanding Alright, I think I can take a sixth base Alpha Blumen trying to resecure his third, meanwhile, 24 workers Oh no Two more Marines Yeah. Let's keep them coming You don't actually need ghost if there's six ultras I mean there's no creep though There's nothing to keep this army in place If you just get a lot of marauders, it can be okay You don't need the microbeck I mean, it just doesn't have enough stuff It's 3 3 Uh E How can I lose this? Zurich is really broken How does he lose this? So if we go over the game in Alpha Blomonstadt, three wrecks, perfect execution, kills the natural Sure, he forgets to produce SUVs for a bit Sure, the gases are a bit late Sure, his transition isn't great I mean, hello, I kill the natural Afterwards, insane harass with the liberator. Actually gets a good amount of kills Then another liberator shows up, only three minutes later while during this time by the way alpha blomond completely decided to give up on SVV production or infrastructure in general he loses like three tanks and seven marines to six muras which i didn't even know was possible but he managed to do it then the constant aggression he throws at his opponent is in alpha blomond's head absolutely insane but in reality he got cleaned up pretty easily the one push that he did at like the 12 minute mark um what more was there really well he just constantly He forgets to build SEVs There was no upgrades He just keeps to buy his wife roses. That's really the issue there He did it once And then he's like, you know what? This game is mine I'm here to collect my MMR points That's not how it works Alpha Blamon That's not how it works You're fighting with Pure Marine against an Ultra Army with literally 3-3 upgrades There was adrenal done But you didn't even know that Hive had started The last time you saw anything of your opponent was with your second liberator You had no map control, no map vision There was like seven mutas that literally killed an entire base Well, not literally, figuratively killed an entire base Everything you did this game was actually awful Like, from start to finish, there was no constant pressure. Like, you didn't harass any of the outside base You didn't drop once I think the worst thing you did was dealing with the mutas So that's the thing. that got me the most is just seeing seven mutas fly around while your entire army is just a fkking at your third or your entire army is afk in your main base and then he attacks your third base with like 12 links and a couple of baylings and just kills everything you my friend are not only a bad lover you also suck really really bad and that's a fact oh i forgot to press this thanks everyone for watching i'll be did enjoy this fantastic episode of is it in Bauer's Do I like this? don't forget that I also have a second channel where I post high level StarCraft 2 cast every single day YouTube to com slash harsdomcasts please check it out and I forget smash like on this video and subscribe here so it helps me a lot it really does please do that or I will come and find you and you don't want that I'm not as funny in real life bye bye."

        "text": "Dear Harstam, I'm a long-time Terran player, returning recently to the game in Legacy of the Void I would consider myself a pretty decent StarCave 2 player, with a 70% win rate in TVT, a 57% win rate in TVZ But Protos is a completely imbalanced race, and thus my current win rate is only 33% It seems like they have zealots in endless supplies, and with the changes to economy and meta getting charged on your zealot is no longer considered an investment And Prodos players just get it before your first attack even hits Let's couple this with the fact that Warpgate is a stupid imbalance mechanic that allows Prodos to make zealots literally anywhere on the map without actually planning ahead. You literally can't put on any aggression without having your expansions and our main flooded with imbalance sideblade boys I hope you realize after watching this replay that I am 100% in the right here Thank you, your biggest fan Hero Dad Hero Dad is a diamond player on Europe Hero Dad, the hero boy turned into a hero dad So you've become a father, that's beautiful We see an 18 scout coming in, oh 17th Scout That's very early I think he might even be able to block a natural with that Not entirely sure on that though So you have a barracks on the way as well looks like barracks gas for him So pretty standard opener Let's take a look at the Toss side. Breaking news, John I'm sorry for breaking in right there, but we have Niels We're right in front of the Harsdom residence here And after last weeks, the Backel with the IOTIS in which the person who got roasted in the IOTIS didn't actually seem to be the person who sent in the replay Harsom has been receiving backlash of this all week already And we hear he is ready to give us a live statement So let's get straight into it So do you want me to cry or just a deep sigh? And what do I say? Do I really have to do this? Oh, we're live? Um, hi I'm really sorry for what happened to you, Alpha Blom man. It was not my intention to roast you I thought you were the one who sent in the replay I deeply apologize and I regret my actions and I will make sure this will never happen again I hope you're happy with this apology Thanks so much for your continued support Yeah, we got it? Good Wow, that was quite a statement indeed If you don't believe that this guy is sorry, then I don't know what you will believe Let's just hope that this fool won't do it again. because otherwise the pitchforks most likely will come out back to you John with a new episode of IHOres Real quick it's gonna be core first right no Nexus before core is completely fine as well on ice and chrome that's of course definitely doable now don't forget bonus points for whoever gets the Ursa doms on this map look at this this powerful creature guarding this he looks so Gary man He is so cool It must be a female Urshalom, of course You can't quite see the gender That's quite the Urshelon Back to the game though So the issue here is going to be charge lots, Warpgate So I'm assuming some Prism harassed killed him And then he got A-moved by Charg's Lott. Yeah, I'm definitely going to be looking forward to that Reaper comes out here as well We'll be able to take out this probe Which is always helpful Of course taking out probes is one of my favorite hobbies as well when I play PVP Let's take a look at this build order This build order is looking pretty normal honestly I can't even complain about anything yet This is new, it's been two minutes and 26 seconds so far And I haven't really found anything that's like you know what This annoys me, why didn't you do this? But the gas timing seems okay His reactor was a couple seconds late, but this is actually, so far, a build order. And I'm honestly a little bit surprised because this is diamond And usually when I get the diamond replace, I get the replace, I'm not quite sure if what I'm seeing is actually a build order He's floating a bit of money, which confuses me He must have done something wrong I feel like his factory might just be late. as well but that could be kind of wrong no starport goes down yet okay i dig it a bunker way too late for any purpose but also i can forgive it okay starport goes down it is a little bit late it is it is a little bit he must have forgotten the factory for a bit as well but once again you know these are things you can expect there's no major errors yet in this build so we're we're completely fine now he said putting on any type of aggression is impossible without getting salads in your base and you just get completely shut down basically that was kind of what he said forge for the tools a robo for the for the for the tools we have a couple of marines being built good SUV production so far once again my man hero boy uh it is showing us quite a decent game meta fact now usually when you play like this i believe the medevac finishes up at around to 420-ish maybe a little earlier maybe 415 or something like that this looks fine maybe it was 4 I can't remember my timings now always good in the world though yeah it's definitely supposed to be 4 it's supposed to be a bit faster but he's actually playing a build order right now barracks 2 and 3 should come down while you get the tech lapse on these buildings they already should have been going down actually should go down a bit before that. That way you can kind of swap them out This can go build a Reactor You can also build a Tank and a Raven and then build a Barracks at this point Also completely fine, but he really does need to build the Barracks You see he's flooding 400 minerals. This just means his stim and combat shield is going to be extremely delayed unless he decides to do a one-one-one push with a lot of marines, a tank and a raven I guess, but that's not very common we also are not seeing an eBay and with this type of build okay here come the barracks usually what you get is um you you also get a third cc if you play like this type of heavy tank tank production and a raven i'm i'm just really confused what he's doing and he's doing a mine drop which i missed he kills 12 workers which is fantastic at this point in my mind the game is completely over like the if you're If you lose 12 workers as a toss, there's absolutely nothing in the world that you can do. That's going to make you win the game if you're on two bases It's just technically not possible So really, if he just hits a somewhat decent timing here, he's going to be absolutely fine But I'm afraid it's going to be hitting a bit late Usually, what you do is you hit at around 620 with Stim and Combat Shield He's going to be starting his Tim and Combat Shield at around 620, I think he's actually going to build a tech lab He says, no He's going to swap There we go Good job, buddy And it's two things So, yeah, this is going to hit extremely late Let's just say that if this timing attack was his girlfriend's period, he would now be a father. Which would make sense because he is called Hero Dad after all You're not still Hero Boy in this game, but after this game he probably became a father because holy crap it's late Like this makes absolutely no sense Yeah, he should be hitting right now He's just going to be like a minute and a half late And this in turn is going to give the ProDos time to build up Now, TOS still doesn't have a third base He's still going to be down in army supply, in worker supply Up in upgrades, though Double eBay is not a thing when you're playing three wrecks You're supposed to play single eBay. Whenever you play three wrecks, you play double eBay when you're playing command center or triple CC before barracks do and three So pretty poor build order all around here for hero boy who is actually going to be looking to hit with a one one timing with a decent amount of units at least he's going to have like four meta facts by the time he's hitting now not not building any extra meta effects now another trick you do is you rarely on your ramp usually in that case when a prism goes in you're very close no matter where it comes in if it comes into the natural you're close if it comes in to the main your close Oops All right. That sure was interesting, but like I said, these units, if they're on the ramp, they're going to be able to deal with things like a prism Really, just with anything If I slow down the replay speed a bit too much But that's okay That's okay We all make mistakes Here comes the prism into the main base Let's not pay attention to that as we have a beautiful fight here No stim, no combat shield The perfect anti-timing Our Prodos player is still going to lose this fight because he's simply down 30 army supply Meanwhile, these zealots in the main base Oh Oh Oh Oh How many times you think we can do this? And they're starting to hurt. Hello, Hero Boy? I'm just going to slow down a bit because Ah, okay All the All the SDV dies, like, wait a second Perhaps I should go So once again, if this response was your girlfriend's period, you would now have two sons Congratulations You're a father twice hero boy Hero dad, might I add Now you have two kids That's real nice Scans a couple of times Like, ah, bases, nice That's beautiful You just leaves his army over here Upgrades finally finished, but now he can't really fight anymore because half of his army is at home, trying to deal with a prison He has news for days, this guy Holy freaking crap. Man, the last time this guy muleed, people still thought the earth was flat I guess that joke doesn't quite work anymore these days I guess the flat herders are coming back, but you know what I mean It's been a long time since this guy threw down some mules Like he could feed a complete continent with the money that he gets from these mules There we go Trows down four of them That's good Money is always nice And he's still in a fine position You see income is looking healthy There's no third base for the TOS yet that is going up Armory is too late Upgrades won't be added This is one hell of a worker split as well, by the way. We see complete oversaturation into the natural and no workers in the main This is like, you're going to be a terrible dad You have your two sons right now And you go, you know, it's your birthday You're going to have to split a pie in half, or at least what you believe is half And I, I'm afraid that one piece is going to be slightly bigger than the other He'll just go, oh, seems fine to me One son's going to be real sad And the other, the other's going to be real happy, my friend, because he gets the big piece That one son that got the small piece, it's going to go into drugs. And then 10 years from now, you wonder, where did it go wrong? It was the moment where you put 24 workers on your natural and only seven in the main That's what went wrong here, oh boy That is what went wrong I told you so And you wouldn't listen Now, you did manage to fix it now, so that's nice These SEVs are taking the trip of a lifetime from the natural to the main to the third You have decent army So if you're in position at this point, or you just Okay, it's going to deal with these salads All right This is a classic as well Deal with a minor problem, so we can ignore the massive issue Also floating 1,200 minerals. So I guess that extra income wasn't really necessary necessarily after all No harass being done, no extra attack Right now against this army, what you want is not Liberators and a Fusion Corps and a second Starboard What you want is Ghost Ghost absolutely hard counter the ever-living crap out of this army because it mainly consists of gateway units Also, mines are really good against this Like, you're crafting the perfect army for losing against Charcelot Arcom, Immortal The only thing you could do is maybe add a single tank or something like that But otherwise, you're actually probably doing one of the best jobs I've seen of crafting an army that gets countered by this. You also manage to attack once again while your upgrades are halfway done and you lose a fight in the middle of the map This is just it's just fantastic I love that probably you looked at this replay before you sent it over and you went like this is the one This is gonna change his mind Yeah, I've seen 50 episodes of this now and all these other guys they the problem with them is they just didn't make a very compelling case, but me I played perfect My first push Sure, it hit without combat, without 1-1, without stim, but, you know, was still a good push My minds killed 12 workers in the early game You know, you're like the kind of guy. Let me pause this You're the kind of guy that makes a good joke once We all have these guys, you know They're not very funny, but they make a good joke once They're laid at night in the bar with your mate Like one good joke And for the rest of his life He's going to keep referring back to that great joke he once made And after the third time, people are like, John, like, it was a good joke, but it's five years ago, you know? Like, no one cares anymore That's what you did here with the widow minds You got 12 kills with the widow minds in the early game, and you're like, you know what? That was a great one. You're just going to keep going like, oh, I deserve to win this game That's not how StarCraft works, buddy You've got to make more than one good decision in your entire life More than one good joke So we got 110 supply for the Protos, 81 for the tar I mean at this point you're dead Like I said, you absolutely countered nothing You micro like a wet teaback You lose your third base with actually you did lift at this time So improvement of a kind But yeah, you're completely, does this guy have storm? No, it does have feedback though You did very, very, very little right here, my friend Once again, no mines I feel like you had a factory though Yeah, you do. It's not using it Fantastic And you do have 2-2 I think you could actually fight this now If you micro Oh, you're afraid of storm And you don't have any meta-vex I think if you micro this, you might be able to win And you have really nice upgrades So you're supposed to split or actually just go back here Just need to keep running though You can't let the arcons connect that easily Yeah Well, never mind Yeah You could absolutely blast it Well, please tell me you Gigi If you don't Gigi, I'm actually gonna judge you very, very hard I'm gonna find your account on Battlenet and I'm gonna flame you today from my barcode accounts. We're gonna be confused who did it to you So if your name is Hero Boy, you got a flame, then you know why you did it Congratulations You can leave as well, man You have 40 supply against 113 Dear Harsh Hey, ha ha Ha ha Ha ha Ha ha My man Real quiz, man This guy If you're watching this, you're a real gangster I love you, buddy Hiro boy, hero boy Oyo, yo We've gone through so much together You became a father, not once, but twice You didn't micro You didn't micro hit every anti-timing you could Forgot to take out the zealots in your main base Forgot to do an actual build order Then you hit another anti-timing with 2-2. You lost your third base while dealing with three zealots in your natural Even though, don't forget, your buildings can literally fly They can fly away The only race that can actually save their buildings by flying away And you just let it die My friend, salads are okay You know, they're good at chasing armies but your unit composition was so bad I honestly don't know what to say That is pure marine marauder, no widow mines, no ghost You went into Fusion Corps, double starboard against an army that consists of pure Archon zealad You know, I love life I love everything, you know, surrounding life.

        "text": "Dear Harston, I'm a big fan of your work I owe this in particular, because this is the only thing worth watching on your channel Wait, what? Kind of a weird backhanded compliment is that to start with? In my opinion, and in opinion of many Terrans of StarCuff community, TVP is the most unbalanced matchup in the days of modern balance I think the reason of that lays behind midgame army of TOS that decimates Terran without any effort Consequently, if Terran did not get severely ahead or killed Tos in the early game, Taryn player should just leave the game and stop wasting his own time, because Toss have freedom to do anything he wants in the most stupid way possible. This game is a good example of Tos just being slow, sucking at micro and multitasking, but still winning because he is good at abusing his race Enjoy So the question is, is it Inba or do I suck? Welcome back to a new episode Alright, so what were the complaints? Well, the first complaint was that nothing except IOTIS apparently is worth watching And the second complaint was that the TOS is imbalanced No use playing a longer game It's a master's player, 4,400 from NA So curious to see What he's going to do here? Is there like my button? Depot first to start with I also just going to have a quick look at the ProDOS Now, whenever I think, of TVP. It is not an easy matchup, of course Like, it's a difficult matchup for both sides As a toss, you can feel like, no matter what you do, you're always going to lose workers to any type of harassed that the Terrant throws at you It can be difficult to scout different things Like, all of these things are always quite annoying to play against You know, you get your Helion droves, your mind droves, your Benchies, Liberators, Battlecruz And on the other hand, for Terrant can be hard to deal with Dark Templar drops or with an early oracle. Even things like Disruptors in the mid or in the late game can be annoying or the charge lot of Imba can be very annoying as well to deal with for Terran players So it's kind of a matchup that has two sides in that way where both players always struggling You're a little complaining from both sides because Widow Mines feel so unfair and for the Terrans, well, everything feels unfair for Terrans because as long as Terran doesn't have 100% win rate, these guys are gonna keep complain seeing SCV Scout, sees a Nexus before Core Terran opened up with gas first, slightly less economical It's actually very rare to see SCV Scout with gas first But, you know, it is of course possible. Gas first does indicate that this is going to be a fast attack, usually with factory units, because you sacrifice a little bit of your economy to get that faster attack out by about 15 to 20 seconds So mine drop can hit it like 420, 418 If you proxy a star port, you can have a helion drop at like four minutes in your opponent's or even 355 if you're really fast So you see the factory go down, reactor goes down straight after And if you're playing barracks first into a Reaper, usually you'll see Reaper and then Marine You simply don't have the gas to get the factory and the reactor So that's kind of a big difference here. Second cache should be going down soon, most likely Okay, he's going to get it on 23 Okay, here we go See what this first reaper can achieve on the other seven laps shouldn't be too much Usually the first adapt is going to be ready already there we go especially against gas first that's kind of a big deal majority I mean it's not going to be that big of a deal because it's just going to be out kind of ignores that Reaper that's an interesting move bunker with gas first is also something you don't see at all You don't have that much money already so investing in the bunker is kind of odd He's late with this swap. The Hellion should almost be out already I'm not sure what he did, but He messed up the build order completely somewhere because the Hellion should pop at about 304 And then this type of move is really not possible Did the Reaper die? No, Reaper went back home or killed an SUV or killed a probe. So actually, I think what's going to happen here is that he opened with gas first so he has all the downsides of gas first uh and none of the advantages that's kind of like buying a calvin klein shirt you know and then not having the brand on it so it's really expensive the quality is the same as any other shirt and then you remove the logo of calving klein and it's just a regular shirt but you paid 15 times as much for it That's pretty much what like my button just did with this build So he paid more for basically the same As a absolutely fantastic It is, it's liberator going to be late These helions are laid. It's good to see that he's got his build orders down And as he started with a backhanded compliment to me, I'll say that I like this build order, except the way you executed it And I also don't like the build order. but I do like Helians so you know there's still some complement in there it's actually going to get damage done as well it is ridiculous it also is a little out of position but I guess four cars killing nine workers that's actually good for Terran usually so Terran's actually in a really good position right now workers I think should actually be even so it means that like my button hasn't been producing SUVs consistently if you kill nine workers I think at this point you should be at least even maybe even one or two workers a half It's okay He's still in a very good spot He forgets his second and third barracks for quite a while already. He's getting mines to deal with any type of follow-up Phoenixes Gonna lose a mine for free It's not the biggest deal I'm not gonna not gonna blame him for that. I'm actually also a thing usually when you play against Stargate is that you actually go into triple cc before triple barracks because a lot of the time it's really difficult to do damage with three wrecks against Stargate so what you want to do is you want to get a bigger army with one one upgrades later on and then just kind of take some map control and perhaps do a two-two push or a big one-one all in off of like five racks and with decent eco behind it something like that but straight three wrecks is really quite uncommon even though in this case I don't even mind it as much because he did so much damage the problem is that he forgot barracks two and three so this is kind of like trying to hit a timing but then basically building everything too late you know it's like doing an immortal all in and then forgetting your robot for two minutes it's like well you're immortal and it's like two less immortals at this point so everything is just going to be delayed like he's absolutely no units usually uh he only also only has 32 workers i guess he lost a couple but all right his lip is also doing damage it's actually good yeah his damage is fantastic he's not macroing at all and he's a supply block like his life depends on it look at this one That's a big one. Two Is he going to build more? I always love it when people build like five depots at the same time It makes me really happy Okay, so he's about to hit Usually you're supposed to hit right now with about 94-95 supply Is it therein? Plus one done, done, stim, combat I guess if you have four cars and open gas first, it's going to be a little later, but let's say seven minutes then He's not even close to hitting at this point He doesn't even have Madox out yet This barracks doesn't even have a reactor yet It's getting a second star port Five wrecks? All right Yes, yes, yes So, I absolutely love everything he does in this build. Except all the Barracksus and the second starport And also his macro is terrible And I don't like his micro So really I just like that he has a couple of mines over here See what I did there, buddy? I can play the same game I can play the same How many mines is he gonna get? If you're dis-afraid of Phoenixes, perhaps you just build two cyclos and like two, three Vikings, buddy Like, this is not the way This really is not the way Especially because his opponent is playing Colossus as well Like, Colossus are really good against mines Does he have any info about what his opponent is doing, though? And he knows it's a row away. Why is he building 11 mines? Wait, where did the starboard go? Did he cancel it? No wait, this is so No, never mind I'm blind This is peak performance guys, two starports Both building a Viking age Okay, here we go He's adding the extra Vikings But for a second there, both the starports are only building a single Viking And that made me really happy Another supply block, which this one might actually last till eternity This one, it is possible that this one never stops He's just not, what is this? It throws a depot on top of her Still supply blocks straight away again Builds two more depots I love this The best part is that he's not doing anything. So he really has no excuse, right? It's like if he was multitasking or something like, parent macro is so hard Like he literally was just producing units It's all he was doing from five racks to two starports You just need to click like five different buttons every 30 seconds and he forgot to click one of them This is absolutely fantastic I love this If you know you have the guys in the band with the triangle, you know, the ting, you have to play like once every minute That's my boy, like my button and he forgot to do it twice already He only has like five times he needs to play the thing. Ding, he already missed two of the five, or two of the three We're not even at the end of the song yet He's already missed this So here comes a push Okay Let's just, let's do some analysis of this situation Okay? Some analysis of this situation Perhaps, you know, let's call it a midgame review Ding da-da-da-ding, ding, ding, ding A little bit of a mid-game review here So what do we see here? We have 136 supply We have eight Vikings, 12 mines, 44 essence CVs, 24 Marines, 9 marauders And we're hitting at 9 minutes and 31 seconds Bit only plus 1 attack No 1-1, no Ghost Academy, nothing Absolutely just this is all there is. Now, if you compare this to the top players, you can see that sometimes they'll have 2-2 on the way already Their supply is going to be way higher They're going to have 66 workers And they're going to have most likely more marauders and less mines Because you don't want to get 24 Marines and 11 mines against Comossus That's absolutely terrible That's not what you want Now, do I still think that, like my button, is going to win this fight and cancel the force base? Yes I think that if he falls asleep in front of his keyboard, A moves Wait, now he A moves, then falls asleep in front of his keyboard, then wakes up 25 seconds later. He's going to have killed this fort base and be ahead But we're going to see exactly what is planet So he has two MettaVex It starts with a stim He moves forward, moves back Minds kill a single zealot Loses his Vikings to all the stalkers while all of his bio is standing in the back How does one Coloss survive? There was two Coloss, and you had eight Vikings I don't think these units have actually done any damage whatsoever I really wish we could see the DPS. of marines and marauders in this fight because he must have done like he just moved around for the majority of it it's like bringing usain bull to the war like all right guys we have a new asset and he can run real fast oh how's you with a gun we're not sure yet but he can run real fast there's like these guys in a nutshell he's done he can just meow meo meo it's moving real fast he loses the fight against someone that went base, Phoenix Colosses, losing workers in the early game, nine of them Like, this should absolutely not be possible against the two base all-in. To be fair, if your two-based all-in hits at the same timing as most people hit their, hit their five-base-two timing, then I guess it makes a little more sense But holy crap, my dude, what is happening over here? Second eBay armory going down Okay, I dig it, I dig it You know, this is something I can dig So, I don't like your build No wait, I love the way you've been playing, but Really, the only thing you did right is getting the second eBay in the armory The rest of it is pretty mediocre Huh? Who's the mad dog now, bro? So Funnily enough, Terran still is kind of okay I mean, supplies are even Upgrades aren't that far ahead of the. for the tools He's gonna get two-two It's getting two getting storm, second robo is nice, seeing some liberated production, I don't mind the liberated production, fifth, six gas, should probably, I mean, he already had the infrastructure up from minute six, so it's not like he needs to add a couple more barracks or a second star port, he already has those things He can just add a 4cc and pretty much go on with his day, which in my opinion, it's nice Nice for him, you know, he's even pulling ahead in supply again I have no clue how that's possible, but probably some macro issues, okay, only has five gateways to make some, sense. Now, how is his map control, his vision? He hasn't taken the tower once yet He has no units on the map, spotting any type of army move out Same could be set for the Toss, but actually, Toss has an observer Toss has more vision Nice Oh, here comes a pushout, blind push out So he just got blasted in a fight against the guy that was up to bases Probably the play is to not move across the map to try and redo that, because you know your opponent had better eco and you didn't win the last fight So, and your tech didn't improve. So really all you're doing is the same thing, except most likely your opponent is going to have more units than he did last time And last time it already went absolutely awful So here we see Oh, stalkers Colossi Storm More units I scan Hmm, it's going to be hard Let me sacrifice my Vikings for real fast There you go Four Vikings for free Now time to return back home I'm not sure I would like my well-time quite know how the game works Maybe if I give him four Vikings, he'll leave the game Bloodless starts moving across the map This is a little bit unlucky for bloodless I mean unlucky, he should have scowl it here Now he might lose a fifth base. I mean, he's still up two bases, so losing one base is fine The worst part is he might actually turn back home If he just goes for the base straight here, I think he wins Straight up No? Oh wow splits off his army I love that It's going to get one, two liberators here Are we using any storms? Yeah, decent storms Disruptor ball perhaps now Okay On the other side, we have the army of bloodless Let's see Usain Bolt? No Actually doing some damage here Jesus Those are some big storms, but no, no, the disruptor ball This was a good fight for bloodless, honestly, here The other hand, this fight didn't go quite as hot I do have to admit. I mean, Bloodless just have better upgrades as well It's 2-2 here against 1-1, so it's just taking a fifth base on the other side You know, he's kind of unfaced, bloodless He split, kept his hat calm It's like, all right, time to kill some workers I guess it is pretty much it for like my button, right? Well, what else is there? Oh, maybe with this flank he can do something Does he have plus 2 yet? Yeah, yeah, it's plus 2 attack right now It's going to be able to clean up these stalkers with these marauders, most likely. if he sends the zealots across the map or spend some of this money wouldn't be possible but you know like my button will live to see another day and now this is a thing that terrans do very often any other player of any other race right now would look at this situation and say hmm okay i lost 20 workers my opponent is still upper base he's expanding again but i mean like my button there's no clue about it he had better upgrades than me better tech better his brain seemed to be functioning what is this I'm gonna just pass my why is he doing this rather than just mining from the natural there's still plenty mineral patches the good old long distance mining while they're still a perfectly fine one right next to you it's like having a water well next to your house and then going to the one five kilometers further away. So why do you do it? It's the same water, well? I don't know It's all like my button do that in a game of StarCrap once So here we are I lost my train of thought man This guy is in my head All right, the other races, they look at this situation and go, all right, this is over Perhaps I'll do a final attack and then I leave the game But Terrence always do this thing where they stay in the game And then they pretend like it's still an even game And then when they lose in a game that goes past 15 minutes, they go, oh, late game is impossible to win Oh yeah, you're down 40 supply, 20 workers. The fact that you're still staying in this game is a testament to how Guter raises defensively Like, this should not be possible, my friend Like, you did nothing right here Still down upgrades? He's still gonna try, you know? Once again, like my button is like, huh? So I lost my entire army again I lost my Planetary Fortress He is way better eco than me better upgrades Maybe another push out is to play, but he comes to his sense, he's like, you know what? No, that's not going to be it What we're going to do now is we're going to siege up, get a sensor tower at my third, another sensor tower at the Planetary Fortress would be great as well. I love the reaction times here Let's see how quickly he's going to be able to respond to these salads I think rather fast Yeah, yeah, this should be fine No stim, there's no real hurry, of course. Money is losers anyway you don't want to get back to mining too fast this toss is playing pretty well i'm impressed with you bloodless i'm good stuff good stuff man you're you're playing a good game here sixth base and everything you just keep expanding getting your upgrades i'm not sure what the voider is but you're my you're my new best friend good job buddy all right like my button still just relaxing over here pumpidumpidom noke hello What's a squad gonna do? Okay, it's gonna just transfer to a new base You see, this is not even that bad The thing that like my button should be thinking about is a sensor tower over here, planetary over here, more liberators than he can imagine. Perhaps just spread one marine over here, one marine over here as well You know, you have some vision in front of your bases The double liberator on top of your own third base, because you think you might be too slow to respond I think that's a good play as well He has been pretty slow to respond, so it's like, you know what? I don't trust my own reaction speed Let's just do it like this This is the equivalent of building like eight cannons on one of your bases, because you're afraid of five zirglings I'm a big fan of that always So is my man bloodless, by the way. So a couple of weird dots on the mini map was like, I think I know what it is Okay, so here, good scan, sees the entire army And what you're going to do now is you're just going to, We actually lost the censor tower, that's bad Because you want to match the movement of your opponent So if the opponent is here, you put the liberators here If the opponent moves here, you put the liberators here If the opponent moves there, et cetera, et cetera You just make sure that your liberator always in position with your army behind it In this case, the army isn't behind it And like my Vatan, it's going to lose four liberators for free A couple of disruptor balls. Going to hit the entire army as well Okay Now, this is one of those clear moments where in the Terran brain you can only think man that looked really broken he just walked into four Liberator zones and killed them because in the Terran mind four liberators which is really not that high of a supply amount should be able to completely cut off this path from the toss from ever should completely cut off this part from the toss from ever and I've added like a bunch of supply in there like that that should be safe right now works I mean, it's going to be fine for a little bit And if you have your army behind it, you can't just walk in. But yeah, if there's just four liberators, just going to blink in and one shot them Like, that's just pretty much how it works Then you tank, uh, tank for disruptor hits with your head first and I died It's like running head first into a wall seven times and then complaining that you have a concussion My friend, like the thing makes you the idiot, not the wall I guess I'm not kind of it works Right, let me just grab the email again, right? He was a big fan of my work I owe this in particular because this is the only thing worth watching on your channel I remember that one And the, yes, imbalanced. If Terran did not get severely ahead or killed toss in the early Well, you did get severely had You kind of did kill toss as well in the early game, my friend So even in your own complaint, it makes no sense because you were really far ahead It's just your follow-up was absolutely terrible your micro in the first fight I'm not quite sure what it was Maybe some guys in the comments can have an explanation for that, but I'm not sure, so I'm just going to leave it to them Then your follow-up is to try and attack again You just keep sacrificing Vikings to the beautiful Protos gods I'm sure they're happy with it, but they don't really repay you in kind. I mean, this to us played a solid game I really can't say to her I was like, all of us moves made sense. like it really was just you who wasn't making much hands five wrecks to startboard against phoenix opener really buddy phoenix colossus 12 mines what kind of defense is that get vikings get colossus or get phikings get uh cyclones there you go yeah it's it's not it's not it's not those that's imbalance my friends it is you that sucks and that is going to be it for today's episode of is it imba or do i suck if you did enjoy this episode don't forget subscribe to my channel it does help me a lot there's more videos like these over here as well don't forget the thumbs up and uh thanks all so much for watching see all next time bye."

        "text": "Harsdom, I need your help I've been trying to climb for the past month, but I always lose versus Mac It's just unbeatable I've tried everything hundreds of times, but the Tarrant can just sit back and turtle on way less bases than me And once they get 3-3, they aim move across the map and kill me I tried using dummy larger groups of veins, great ravager shots, and kept him at bay, but after not long he walks across the maps, beats me with is thors and tanks I will not accept that this is balanced and I believe if any Terran chooses bio over Mac in this matchup, they are the ones who suck So harsed them. Is it imba or do I suck? A fantastic question here by Waga-Buga, a Zirk player who is in a diamond and is opening up with a hatch first So he uses dummy big numbers of bates and great ravager shots Now, I'm not sure what the amount of dummy big numbers of baines is, but I think somewhere around 30 baines That's a dummy big number, number And the great reverber shots, I mean, I'll be the one to judge I'll be the one to judge All right So we have the Taryn opening up with one Raxxpan, no gas Also decided not to scout, so that's kind of interesting. Agabuga is doing some scouting here in the early game, which I'm a big fan of, of course Always good to get those overlors out and about Opening seems pretty standard Now against Mac, we've done a couple of Mac replays in the past And something that always kind of strikes me is a couple of things First of all, it's very common for Zirks to get a very high drone count because they see pro players do this And what they do is they get that very high drone count and then they just sit back and they have a couple of bad fights Now, the thing with a high drone count, drone count is, is that your army is going to be very small. So you're constantly going to need to be trading This is not something that lower level Zerks do Usually they just get a very high drone count, get a lot of money, and then they trade once every four minutes, and then the other guy moves across the map and just kind of kills them It's really quite common Another thing is unit compositions tend to go all over the place If we remember the logo thing, they just, no Zerks tend to switch between compositions kind of willy-nilly, which isn't great Usually it's good to pick a composition and kind of stick with it and progress like there is a plan behind it Instead of just going, oh crap, this didn't work Let me try this one. That's not really how Starcraft is supposed to work We see a road war on the way Here for Wagabuga, that's a very early road war This opponent's playing triple factory Wagabuga has confirmed that indeed there is at least one factory on the way It doesn't know about this. he see but I mean he can guess that building a bunch of links no roaches yet I'm not sure why oh he's supply block extremely supply block at 36 so yeah this type of roach attack I mean it's a cut at 26 workers is going to have to do a lot of that much right that just kind of makes sense that you can't really cut workers this early be behind in workers against the turn and not kill any workers so we'll see if he gets very far ahead here or what is going to happen as the Terran continues, man You're doing a lot of depots this guy It's the beauty of Mac, isn't it? One click, six supply. So you always need to have loads of supply available Now, we have four more roach on the way, already three out, not quite moving across the map yet I'm not entirely sure what he's doing here Maybe he's defensive roaches? Maybe he wants to group up Then walk with him in a group, hello Two more queens Two more roaches I love how he just builds it in increments, you know? It's like, oh, I could build all these seven roaches at the same time But what if I build them two by two and then save them up? So I hit a solid minute later than I should And the other guy in his brain goes, oh, sounds all right Here we are. This hits really, really He's down eight workers I mean, by the time he's going to hit, his opponent's going to have like five tanks out Well, not quite, but I mean, there's gonna be some tanks out So, I mean, income is not looking too hot right now for the Zirk player Now he sees a bunker, five cars, he's like, huh, that's interesting First tank pops, not a single raverger, so you can't really burst down puts two SUVs in the bunker I love it What is this? Shows the roaches so his opponent can prepare, and then moves back home. Maybe he knows that he is just way superior when it comes to the mid and late game, that he always gives his opponent a massive advantage in the early game Because he knows it's not fair otherwise He's just too good You know, you have these guys who tell me they have the grandmaster knowledge of the game This guy doesn't have the grandmaster knowledge, it's like the grandmaster mechanics He's just so good in the mid and the late game that he knows exactly what to do He's building eight drones now These roaches actually did nothing None of them have any damage None of them have a kill He just built, what is it? Nine roaches Just for jokes. It's not like the other guy really cut any work products I mean, he already was at 44 workers This guy went two command center, five factory, which is not a build order, but, you know, it's still more of a build order than whatever the hell it is that Wagabuga is doing I'm still waiting for these great ravager shots, by the way. the way if I've seen zero I love to just adding ravagers I have no clue what's happening here honestly neither has Wagabuga the last time he saw something was when that factory was building he doesn't know if it's Mac I mean I guess he can guess it I wouldn't mind an overseer scout at this point honestly let's also not forget that Nikondi literally has done nothing for the first six minutes like no harass nothing he's just been sitting here like Like, Wagabuga could have been playing against the AI and have similar results basically Like he hasn't been tempted or touched once He hasn't been attacked once And yet, how many tumors do we have? He has nine creep tumors only with five queens. Like, how's that even possible? For seven minutes, he's had three creeps threat It's not like he was busy attacking What has he been doing? His injects look okay He has a good larva count He's getting a baling nest Oh, this is a classic as well So this is Roach Ravager attack upgrades and then going into Bailings No, adding six Ravagers So he's going to be playing Ling, Bain, Roach, but with upgrades for the range Now the reason why this sucks is very simple It sucks because the main damage of the Ravitor is going to be the bile. be the bile and that damage output doesn't change with upgrades and the banlings are going to be the rest of your damage which means that it's better to get uh melee upgrades than it is to get range upgrade with this like he's not actually a head i bet okay this is what happened wagabuga in his head he thought of this as like man i really contained him hard with my with my ravager place you know some crazy good bile shots kills two s evs and three tumors he started cutting workers at uh 26 for this attack Let's not forget about that Crazy good ravager shots This is also the type of guy who looks at this replay and sees 140 supply against 132. 59 workers against 48 and he goes his head This is kind of like, you know when you go bowling and you So you're doing one-on-one competitive bowling like most people do, you know, on their Friday evenings If you don't have friends to go out with And your friend starts, you know, your friend's name is Wagabuga And he throws over five pins And then he goes, man, I'm so far ahead And you tell Wagabuga, well, like, you had the first turn Like, now it's my turn So I can throw over more pins He goes, no, no, no Like, I just threw over five pins I'm up five pins Like, and I go, that's not quite how it works And it's my turn. I throw over seven pins I'm like, I'm up too Then he starts complaining about this bowling ball being too slow Like, mate, your army consists of road and revergers like these guys inflates it by you're not actually ahead at this right hell you're super far behind he has eight tanks out and three thors already and all you have is roaches and reverers your army gets hard countered you don't have the eco to easily switch out of things why the hell are you still on a layer against someone mecking like you should be going probably fiber with this composition on it like you only have range you can't rush into him now you get to aspire a hydra dam. Like I have some beating Grandmaster with stupid challenges where I had to build every single unit, but unless you're also a YouTuber who's making some content right now, I have no clue what you're doing 17 more Roaches, Baneling speed, no Infestation Pit I mean, who really needs Hive, right? Ultralisk suck I mean, I wouldn't even mind Infestors here against this army You could get some, like there's a big, Thor count already Like, you see the big Thor count You see there's like five Thors Why the hell are you building a Spire? Like, are you going to mass Muta at this point? Like, that's absolutely not possible Six more Drones. So, he's actually getting a good drone count now, but as I said before, he's just not trading He's not doing anything And he's just building units that are running out of steam very fast, and then not doing anything with it It just doesn't make a lot of sense It's like, if you're gonna, like, these units have a massive time limit on them, right? Especially if you're not getting any extra attack with it Like you need to be trading them out asap because they keep getting worse If you have 10 roaches against three tanks or two tanks, that's kind of okay for the roaches still. But if you have like 15 tanks against 25 roaches, like you might get a single bile like how are these crazy good boughs? I mean, yeah, okay, I guess here I got three things Resources lost? Pretty much in favor of the Terran still Like these fights are so bad This is what I'm talking about He should have been trading such a long time Look at the units lost He just loses his entire army 4 7K resources down And this, yeah, he's pulling a loco He goes, man, road reverters is like a list, you know Compositions that might be able to work And he just scratched off the first one All right, road treader is crap 48 links, 9 mutas is next. who cares that there's 17 tours out already well five tours out already three more on the way there are cyclones the only thing that there isn't is turrets like all right the next one if the mutas don't work maybe he'll go into ultras and then maybe he'll go into investors and then when all of them have failed because he doesn't have the correct upgrades for them then he sends me an email complaining about things this is 18 bailings I love it look plus two range about the finish up So as he has a pretty vital timing here, he has a 2-2 timing basically, with range upgrades All the range units he has left right now is this guy. This is the only range unit Imagine you're in the army, all right? Imagine you're in the army And your army consists of 30 Marines You know, and one tank, one guy that drives a tank Okay, now, let me make it better 5,000 Marines with, like, guns and, I don't know, their shields and whatever I don't know how Marines work made And then you have one guy who drives a tank And then your commander has the choice to invest into two things. It's going to be either training for all these 5,000 Marines, making sure, you know, just proper training, making sure they know how to use their guns and stuff like that, making sure that they know how the strategies work, or they can give the tank guy a bunch of training, so he can shoot maybe 0 5 times faster, 1 5 times faster And your commander goes, well, you know, these 5,000 Marines, it might be fun to help them improve, but how about we make this tank really freaking strong? And then what we do is we leave this tank behind when we're going to fight, because I have my doubt that this Revitor is ever going to participate in a fight. Because this guy, I'm pretty sure isn't HotKit anymore, so unless this guy uses F2, which I don't think he is, this Revitor is not going to be seeing any action, and these two-two upgrades, or at least the plus two range, is completely wasted Now, Mutas are actually doing some damage This fight is already fantastic He managed to actually stack up links so that the Hellbet's got more surface area on them I didn't know that was possible, but Vuga-Buga really is showing me a thing or two here about StarCraft and the optimal way of losing units It's almost 7K behind in resources lost And it's actually down in supply right now, which I have no clue how he's doing. He also said in his email that they move out once they have to be made Your opponent has plus one upgrades And you might say, well, that's pretty broken that Taryn with only plus one upgrades can beat an army that's 2-2 except the army that wugabuga is making doesn't have any upgrades these guys don't have any attack upgrades now this is a I was gonna say this is a good run by and then he literally threw like 45 banlings into five d'y depots and two planetaries I wouldn't have minded that if his opponent wasn't already on 30 workers and is probably about to attack him. And if he had like some type of transition behind it or you know way more baines that he could actually knows for a fact that he can kill this army 14k against 6k Okay He has, yes, okay, so he's Plus one on the links finishes He's like, huh You know, I finally got some upgrades for the Baylings Maybe I should go back into the range upgrades, because don't forget, we still have this guy over here Oh, no It kills three Thor's You wonder what these guys would have been able to do with some upgrades, perhaps And then his response is like, okay, well, Now, Roche Raveter hasn't worked, Link bailing doesn't do anything Time to build my Hydras. Lurker than, Greater Spire and Ultraliscaverer to really round out my tag Let's see what we can do At this point, his opponent is literally a plus one upgrades Um Okay, we'll see how the fight is going to go because a lot of the time it's pretty difficult for Zirk to get all the units in at the same time see a bunch of hydras I have a feeling this is not going to be enough Tanks are siege He's just walking into siege tanks and Thor's, there's no vipers Ha ha ha ha ha ha Mac broken, he says Mac broken All right, like, you completely forgot to use any type of hive units He had all the tech Don't get me wrong. Greater Spire Ultra Cavern He had a hive He was getting three, three upgrades All of all very nice Never used the information pit for investors, but he completely skipped Vipers, which is one of the most useful units that there is His early game was terrible Then he got a really high eco and didn't trade at all Well, no, that's not true He traded, he killed four depots and two command centers Rather than attacking his opponent's army, even though his opponent was already on 30 SUVs at that point So it's pretty poor eco He didn't need to kill more eco, just needed to kill the army, make sure that he wouldn't die He switched compositions three times at the wrong upgrades for the banlings. He, I mean, his creep threat was kind of atrocious for, actually, I'm kind of curious What was the vision of that? I feel like this Terran never harassed This Terran saw the edge of the creep, 13 minutes in This Terran did absolutely nothing to stop his opponent from doing whatever he wanted And Wagabuga did whatever he wanted And then he complained because the things he wanted to do weren't actually the things that were going to work, you know Imagine getting free Wagabuga is the manager of a company It gets complete freedom from the CEO And he invest his entire savings in a toilet that instead of flushing everything down, just pushes it out, you know, blows it out of the top. So every time after you're done doing your business at the toilet, you also need to clean it up And then when he gets fired because it's a crap, a crap investment, he starts complaining and sending me emails about how unfair it is in the world Like, mate, you had all the freedom in the world and this is what you did with it Like, he had plus one attacks Wagabuga, my friend Mac can be difficult to deal with I understand that It can feel broken at times It can feel like that I understand that as well But this game, was honestly just a show of pure incompetence from your part You did nothing correct and everything wrong You get this guy. The world's most well-upgraded Ravager Hasn't seen any use though You just suck, dude You suck so freaking hard It's insane Declinced No, wait, I need to press the button for this Thanks so much for watching Another fantastic episode of Is It In My Are Do I Suck?

        "text": "Harston, I am contact you And please be gentle Love your void ray Love your videos Voidre the other way around, Kevin After spotting Bredel Is it Imba? Or do I suck? Welcome back to a new episode as apparently we were already a little bit too far into this replay Oh my god That's stupid idiot Harsham I'm contacting you regarding the seemingly unbalanced composition of bio with armored battlecruisers I am not complaining about the overpowered nature of the troops themselves, but rather their absurd cost effectiveness I am a 4 1K MMR Diamond Prodos who is rather flustered with the outcome of this game After spotting battle cruisers early, I quickly rushed to counter, but my attempts were futile. pitiful attacks with my army were easily thwarted by a rag-tag group of battle cruisers and a few marines I was flabbergasted as to how I could have possibly beaten this terrain without raising my IQ by more than 10 points Let me know what you think And please be gentle I'm always gentle, Voidre So the question here is, is it Inba? Or do I suck? Let's hop straight into this game as we have a little bit of a little wall here coming out of our ProDos players on the low ground Might be confusing this for a PVZ instead So what did he really say? A rack-tag group of marines and armored battle cruisers, something like that. He said he spotted the battle cruisers early, but really couldn't do anything about it There's just some big claims and we're of course, we're going to be seeing if these claims do end up checking out, right? We want to make sure that these claims do check out So he scouts, it's like, all right, what do I scout? What do he scout? No barracks at home Hmm, is there gas? Is there gas? There's gas All right How much gas? You click the gas You see, hmm, not that much gone Reaper Proxy Reaper You know, estimation, proxy reaper What do we do? Core, Nexus No Yes Yes Yes Pylon gas Just a standard builder Standard Corp No No Pylon first. If you get the gas first, what happens is that you'll be supply blocked Or you can't build workers One of the two Both are bad So now he'll need to cut workers to get his adept out, which means he has two less workers than usual So even if this Reaper does absolutely nothing, which which seems rather unlikely as this is a 4 1k mmr diamond prolos player it will already be worth it for the turn killing two works is completely fine It's getting a bunker please tell me this Reaper at least goes into the main first Thank God here we go. Okay this is good for the for the terror at least our boy void ray is going to be struggling a little bit I can I can assure you that one two now don't forget this is plus two so every probe that dies you got to imagine the plus all right it's just a just a prob case so you kill three workers technically all right three workers are dead now the way you want to respond to this is not what an adapt but with a stalker and a battery stalker and a battery can clear this if you use the super battery um you're definitely going to clear it without losing anything sometimes i even like to get a battery in my main so when you finish the bunker sometimes they'll jump into the main with two reapers and start killing probes there which is annoying now void ray spots this and then go goes, huh, what should I do? Should I. Should I maybe attack the bunker, build a battery, get some defenses ready? No, just stand over here Do not across the map I like this This is Voidre, the kind of guy that when he has problems at home, goes out to the bar with his mates And he's like, as long as he isn't at home, there's really no problems at home either Marriage and shambles Sure That's okay No real big issue. issue what's the worst that can happen it's like the what you call it the the babysitter has to deal with all the trouble it's one adept is not enough the O pair it's gonna leave soon as well yeah what you just want to do is you just want to get a battery here buddy you don't get what four in a row Zero pro production as well Just cancelled all of them as well I was wondering where all the money was amazing This macro is pretty decent I guess Voidre is doing some damage on the other side, but it's denying the CC That shouldn't happen This is getting rewarded for bad play, and I don't like that. So, I can't believe that this actually happening There's no way in hell, though, that this actually is happening You know what I'm saying? this immortal surely is going to attack the bunker right i've never seen two reapers kill a nexus before it took him like two and a half minutes almost three to get it to this low imagine the effort these guys have been putting in like this is the equivalent of like a stormtrooper actually killing a jedi you know like while the jedi is asleep and the stormtroopers can't believe their luck They keep shooting, keep missing Like, eventually we're going to hit And after three minutes, like, the Jedi wakes up and smashes them, that's the immortal But holy crap, Voidre. You had two and a half minutes of not mining from the space And sure, the Terran had the same thing, but that's his problem You know, your problem here was that two reapers and a single bunker managed to actually completely destroy your eco You're still behind You're supposed to be up six, seven workers at this point You're up only four, which is bad Your opponent has double, uh, double mew, which gives him way higher income That's, well, way higher Should give him higher income, not way higher, just regular higher I'm going to forge Twilight, you have an observer Okay, so here comes the, the spalling observer that spotted the battle cruisers very early Ding, ding, ding, ding, tin, tin, tin, tin, tin. These guys are so slow They look a bit like jellyfish, don't they? Like a mechanical jellyfish This guy's lucky SpongeBob is around So we have the Fusion Corps done for the bunker positioning It's absolutely brilliant as well I love it Prism, Robo Bay, Forge, Twilight I think he's doing the get all the tech, but no upgrades challenge Oh, here we go Armor upgrade Observer spots Starport getting something He sees two barracks, a bunker, a single mine Doesn't spot behind the mineral line. the mineral line he also sees something happening here so this is either drilling claws or the cyclone upgrades most likely I would think that this would be drilling clause but maybe he has a different lead as a experienced diamond player now he isn't actually spotting the battle cruiser is he he is aware that there's a tech lab but this could be a raven this could be a benchy technically could still be a matterback or a Viking as well but less likely and as long as he doesn't see the fusion core he actually isn't aware and we see no preparations no batteries no nothing usually oh the battle river could come in and snipe this base couldn't it big scan big scan okay we have an attack at the same time as well so this is going to be weird i think bc probably will stay home ah if it tepees though i think our toss is in a world of trouble here he doesn't actually have that much so all right i just want to pause here for a moment. I say that Armand Voidre said he spotted the battle cruiser early Now, he spotted the battle cruiser as the worst thing in his life was about to happen He was about to lose, like, I know, it's going to be like 12 pros This is not spotting early This is like, imagine you're having a conversation with your mate, yeah? And you just divorced your wife And you tell your friends, it's okay, guys, like, I spot it pretty early Then my wife was cheating on. me and they go like oh really you knew it fast like yeah yeah like when I caught her in bed with the other guy like I just knew it and you're a maze go like what like yeah yeah like I was so sure at that point that's not how it works buddy this is not spotting it early this is spotting it as it happens like I saw the bullet coming oh yeah he had a gun and then he shot you like you notice the hole in your leg it's not how it works right I missed part of this fight Salads Wait what? I want to see this again Oh no, my analogy was too long and I missed a good part. Look at this, look at this guys All right We got, let me explain anything about armor types here, Mr Voidre So we got this bad boy does a lot of damage to armoured Okay This is the big guns Okay, there's like insane damage against the armored Banker, buildings in general, armored, all right? Look at the focus fire of this immortal First shot on the tank Second shot on the tank Third shot on the tank Perfect so far Marine Marine Marine S E V SV SV Dem it Banker has too much HP move over to the tank Don't actually end up killing the bunker This is like having an anti-armor rifle and then using a stick to fight a tank. My friend, you're an idiot Oh wait, that's at the end I can't make judgments yet Perhaps this is imbalanced because the SUVs, they get the aggression from the immortal and it's difficult to target Battle Cruiser, 14 worker kills I wonder if we actually move the probes I don't think so I think he just, no, okay, he moved some It just makes me happy to see this battle cruiser absolutely ravaging this guy's life Four workers up right now Now, the logical response to this would be to get as much mineral mining as possible, because you're lacking completely. You want a very fast third base, you want to catch up as much an eco as possible, and then you're going to be working with one of the combat mechanics at TOS have So that's either going to be very thirdly with Colossus or Disruptor, or it's going to be DTs DT is a good combat mechanic People make jokes about it when behind Dark Shrine Yes, when behind you do go Dark Shrine It's a good freaking combat mechanic Like, that's just how it worked Like, honestly, if you're playing like this, you're going to need one handle of a combat I'm getting to get you back into this game And in that case, the Dark Shrine is a. Hello? What button did I just press? And in that case, the Dark Shrine is a fantastic tool for people like you I'm also a big fan of the 10 Stalker Squad when all you have is charged Four more stalkers Why not? Should you get Blink, maybe? Yeah, we got charged already One of the Twilight upgrades This should be absolutely fine Blink Stalkers also a good way to get back in the game, by the way I can do a lot of a rats with that, especially in the lower leagues very poor base defenses very often So, poof, another big disruptor shot, good stuff Battlecruiser going back home to be repaired I mean, there's a motto on this You can just get himato. I guess he goes for the observer, so I'd go for the observer Just for banter Okay, he gets to disrupt His army is actually quite big There's literally a tank, five Marines and a battle cruiser And he sees all of this I think he could just actually walk in and kill it If he had blinker, he would definitely win the game Here we go So that's a good move He gets 20 damage on the battle cruiser, lose the stalker for it I like it and I see that type of micro Micro, my stalker's real good there, Chief Alright You sure about that? I said, are you sure? No upgrades being researched after the armor upgrade You know what? It's not that necessary anymore. Upgrades are old school What we want now is a Stargate Because I don't know why What we needed was a third base, a fourth base He should have been on four base already at this point He shouldn't have taken gas here and just straight rushed fourth base and then taking gas And then going to Tempest Colossus or something like, or Colossus Blinkstalker, I don't care Like his army comp of the Terran is absolutely terrible He's no units whatsoever So the only aggression that's going to show up is going to be like a single BC Voidre Colossus? Voidre's are so freaking bad against battle cruisers. For some reason, people got it in their head that Voidre's are okay against battle crews, but Voidre's suck massively, dude They get one shot by freaking Yamato, and then they just teleport out And they're slow, unless you get Fluxvein, then they're pretty fast I do like flux veins It makes them pretty fast I like how Voidre is containing his opponent, while as a while I'm going to be able to be able to opponent is outmining him And he's not even containing him because the moment his opponent wants to leave, he's like, all right, now you piss off But he's like, oh, okay, sorry I didn't mean to intrude into your territory Colossus shows up as well Three battle cruisers Please blink in. There's no blink yet Dish He really believed he had him, didn't he? I always love seeing that He's completely unaware of where this game is going down in income the entire game worse units I think I could just keep warping in units and contain them on two base forever that was his plan here I can see it I can see that was his plan there's no way okay opponent still on look some opponents macroing well by the way look at it look at these the money that this guy's I guess he doesn't have too much income I like that still no blink plus two armor only gets units that benefit from attack Gets armor upgrades I love it No double four cheater. The void ray I had no clue what he's doing After that last fight, he's like, I want some more of that Let me walk into a couple more tank shots I guess Yamatos aren't of cool down yet Maybe you should wait for that Yeah, yeah Please do wait for that If he waits for the Yamatos to come off cool down and then goes again, I feel like I might just want to quit this replay. You just pretend this week never, happened and pick up where we left next week you know like what is the use void ray what is the use you think he has a timer next to his PC whenever he gets the amount to put the stop wash and he's like oh he has the amount to again time to attack the least cost efficient man in the world void ray one hell of a guy to have in your company resource management Oh, yes, Yamato is of cool down, here we go Whop, whoop Voidres got absolutely blasted by the Marines and the battle cruisers I don't think anyone could have predicted that now, could they? 1,200 minerals in the bank, no problem. You could say, well, his opponent's also floating 1,500 minerals It's true, his opponent also has 40 supply, and has more than 50 IQ So, you know, I've got to pick your battles a little bit here, guys bit here guys Fourth base, I like it I enjoy this I enjoy this Now, you might be wondering Kevin, if you even knew my name, Harstam Why is he still building so many Colossus? It seems like the need for Colossus is not that high here And I would say, yes, I agree Because there's very little bio-units It's picking up now, but There's still very little bio units and it doesn't seem to be the main issue The main issue is just that he doesn't have enough Stuff. He has no units Really? You know why they call me Voidre I think this is, I think he should ask for a name change after this game The idiot Moron Fool Crapper There's lots of names I have for you Voidre And just because you build three Voidreys this game doesn't mean that Voidray is gonna stick I feel like a name change here is on its place, Editor Let me do the animation move Ching! You'll have some fun with it Sometimes you gotta give your editor something, you know Just like kids Throw them like a candy cane or something like that Throw it really hard to BAM! On their hat No blink yet Right now we're on 13 stalkers. This is a man who built charge for nine zealots, then lost 16 stalkers without blink and built 12 more This is the kind of person we're dealing with The kind of guy to go armor upgrades on his air on units that are going to get one shot by Yamato the kind of guy that looks at this army of seven tanks and four battle cruisers actually I don't mind the colossal anywhere's 31 marines I was gonna make a joke but I I stepped back I looked at the situation and said to myself no this is not the time and you know what it wasn't I love the arcons this is how people that don't understand the game think you counter battle cruisers. It's by building Arcons and Voidreys Because like well both Dijun's do a lot of damage But the problem is that they just die before they ever get anywhere Tempest actually is a good counter to the battle cruisers Tempest because you need to look at these Yamatos, look at that Actually this fight is going a lot better and I thought it would be for Voidray I thought Voidray was going to get completely blasted here, but he's actually only going That was a sick blink I love that That was cool This was not a bad fight here for Voidre I'm surprised, honestly I'm actually surprised. Dush! Usually what you do is, let's see you damage the Voidre a little bit and bam! You shoot it with the Yamato and then all the Voidre's died because otherwise Voidreys actually have insane Dement GPS, but this is actually not looking too bad Right now, if I'm Voyder, I'm like, okay, I just had a good fight How about, instead of throwing my lead or my little bit of momentum, I just built 20 extra probes and I actually play a late game from here He's actually winning He's doing it No? He's not doing it Oh, no. he could have killed this entire base for free he's still killing this entire base he had such a good such a good opportunity here for a second i actually thought he had it not due to his own competence but due to his opponent's incompetence let's be real here this was not because he played this well his composition still sucks voidray coloss is not a composition guys also please get blink and still getting freaking armor upgrades for your i understand why you want armor upgrades against bc's but the thing is you don't you want to just kill the bc's a7 when you're playing stalker colossi you want to be doing as much damage as possible you want attack upgrades they're cool armor upgrades are for losers look you're going to be killing marines anyway that's not really going to be the issue is this going to be the attack of a lifetime if he catches him in the middle of the map he still is absolutely going to get blasted yeah still by the way just a friendly reminder that not a single turret had been built d t's at any point in the game would have been perfect i'm telling you guys dark shrines underrated they have this bad i like this this is a good this is a good move the base trade is a good move because he knows he can't fight it this is something i see a lot of people actually make mistakes and but i like this this is a good Good move, Yoink. Yoink, I like that name Oh, good move, Voidre I like this Now, this is less of a good move Do you have storm? Do you have storm? No Just had a Templar there What is this Templar doing? What in this army made you think? I think it would be sick if I have a Templar on which I just save a lot of energy Was it for feedbacking the Metafax? Maybe he thought he could feedback battle cruisers It didn't realize not possible Does he control the power? the Templar individually I want to see this No, he doesn't just aim moves everything One more Templar This is absolutely fascinating to watch. You know how there's some famous of people who have very specific type of brain damage and then they study these people to see what the exact effects are of the of the brain damage because you don't really to experiment with people's brains you know you can't just damage someone's brain and study it so what they do is they find people who already have brain damage and then they study them do loads of tests with it I feel like we might have a very valuable asset to the to neurologist here in Voidre because I'm not sure what type of damage this guy has but He is completely out of it We could do so many good experiments with him Holy crap. Just staying on six, less than 60 workers the entire game against a turtling Terran Bro, how do you have so much money? Alright Imagine you're a void ray and you're sitting on your porch you don't have a job okay there's nothing wrong with that but void ray also doesn't want a job sits on his porch and drinks lemonade he loves lemonade sees his neighbor go by to his to his job every single day howdy neighbor howdy voidre comes back at night worked nine hour shift but back in his house kisses his wife they have a good marriage void ray doesn't next day same thing this same thing this same goes on for 10 years, five years, five years. After five years, the neighbor comes over to Vojera, says, hey, I'm going to move, I'm going to move to a way bigger house And Vojer goes like, but how can you afford that? Bro, how do you have so much money? Well, you worked, you prick Freaking my man, Joink here was building SCVs and mulling bases while you were there drinking lemonade on your stupid porch That's how you get more money by working for it Unbelievable Let me open up this stupid email again I had triggered again Quickly rushed to counter, but my attempts were futile Futile Futile Yeah, it's because you're immortal, start attacking SEVs He probably actually wouldn't be able to win with that counter attack. He also lost the prism to a cyclone, if I recall correctly Like, everything in that attack went wrong He actually forgot the, micro and he couldn't reinforce And he lost 15 workers to a freaking battle cruiser at the same time I was flabbergasted as to how I could possibly have beaten this terrain without raising my IQ by more than 10 points Yeah Doubling your IQ is a pretty difficult task Honestly, I don't think Battle Cruiser bio is overpowered, my dude You can just get tempus, you just get a lot of eco Any type of harass would have been nice, but you didn't do that either My friend, this is an imbalance You just suck Declinsed, declinced All right Thanks for everyone for watching. Don't go anywhere, as we have a little special thing after the credits But don't forget to subscribe and press the other things, like and stuff like that See you next time Start the tape."

I woke up to an imbalance complain of our good old friend Derivative who once upon time complained about the IMBA-ness of flying dragons in PvZ! Now he is back with a brandnew case to crack! Will history repeat or will he redeem himself?",

        "text": "Hello Harsdom, it's me Your Flying Dragon Boy Look, I found investors are so imba, even much more imba than the Flying Dragon In this game I did a push with three oracles and one immortal when the Zurgis transitioning into Mutas As my micro was stats alike, it was a great timing attack He pulled out all his drones and struggled to hold it with a poor one-base economy remaining While I have three bases and a healthy worker amount, I defended against innumerable mutas with shield batteries and stalkers, And then, I switched into Phoenix Finally, when I reached a certain amount of Phoenixes, it's my turn to push back and make him pay However, unexpected investors crushed all my troops and my dream of victory. Infestors easily finished off my ground units and army, as if they were playing with a bunch of shiny plastic toys. How on earth can he make so many Infestors after producing so many mutas? I mean, they're all so gas-expensive, right? It's impossible for Protoss to have Phoenixes and High Templars with six to eight workers. Fungals are fatal to all Protoss units as my units are all expensive and clumsy. You must watch this replay. Trust me. After that you feel the necessity to delete this broken unit or race as well. My friend is 5.5k MMR in Korea server and this game which I had the chance was really broad on my horizon. I have no clue what the last line means, but I know what the lines before it mean It means we have a second timer Mr Flying Dragon himself, the man who completely complained about mutas originally, my Chinese friend Welcome back, first of all Glad to see you're still playing derivative He's called, sent me this replay, complaining about investors this time Now, there was some mutas in here, but it seems like he learned at least a little bit from his last run-in with IOTIS And he didn't complain about the mutas anymore He built Phoenixes and was fine against it apparently But now investors are the issue here. they easily crushed his units like there were some plastic shiny toys i haven't seen many shiny plastic toys but i'd love to see him i once i read this i got this email this this this this email and i was like oh my god this is so good i put on my my sweater which i bought in china last year in in chong ching i was like i got a you know i got a go i didn't really want to wake up this morning you know i was in bed i checked my phone and i see this email from derivative I'm like, okay, this is it It's time to go And here we are Oh, man, this is going to be good. I'm really hyped for this So yeah, obviously our main thing here is to figure out whether derivative sucks for a second time So a double suck Or if the investor is broken And investor is a unit that has been broken in the past. So why isn't it broken still? You might be wondering that's a good question that's a very good question we see just standard openings coming from both players of course we have chronobust on the adapt good Stargate timing this guy knows what he's doing he's about 5k MMR on the Korean server like he's a solid solid player derivative even last time I remember his opening wasn't that bad Stargate probably just gonna go into Oracle's like he said and then the first thing of course we want to be looking at is how well does he do with the Oracle or ass is he just gonna be standing there is he is he going to be sleeping around this you know what sleeping around I hope but just he's going to stay there sleeping is what I meant I if your oracle sleep around you have whole other issues on your hands as messed up just how is your time with the Queen's yeah I was alright you got speed on the way first Oracle second Gateway a couple of adapts. Three, third adept, is on the way here And after three adepts, he should be taking his nexus If you're playing Oracle, Oracle as an opener, you should be getting nexus before you get your assimilators Now, sometimes you see players, you're like, well, the Trap takes his assimilators before the third That's correct, and Trap does that if he sacrifices his first two adepts Because with two adepts early on, you're always going to be able to get that third base up very, very quickly So I kind of expected this This is a very common mistake for low GM players to high masters, where they take gases and don't focus enough on mineral economy So it's a small error getting robo before third base. It's very old-school this This is what we played in mid-2019, maybe mid-2018 I can't quite remember which year it was I think 2019 So like last year, like 13-14 months ago we played like this I'm not really a fan of it anymore, though So it's kind of been figured out The opponent gets overlord speed, which is good as well We see four adepts being shaded down, so even warped into more adepts This base is about 30 seconds, 35 seconds late It's not ideal really It's probably going to get a decent trade here though if the Zerk decides to fight this I'm going to be focusing mainly on these oracles I don't think No, won't fall Okay So these two oracles. I'm not sure if they're sleeping around with the queens, but but they were a little bit too kind for them So zero kill so far And he's just going to park them in this little area for Yeah, for how long? How long are you going to I like that he keeps selecting them He's just spamming the hot keys They keep selecting them again and again, not actually doing anything This is This is not good So, the faster you do damage, which you're already He keeps selecting them Why are you doing that? Stop doing that If you're not going to use them Stop selecting them Okay, there we go The earlier you do damage, the better it is and then. I like this guy pulled away all of his works Oh my gases are being stasis They just pull all my works too less What was this? What was that? Derivative, my man Why would she do that? Six gates? So it's going up to eight, that's too many Sixgate actually is the maximum you want to get with this push I'm familiar with this push This push is also hitting too late, by the way I already knew that, of course I could smell it coming It's going to be too late These should be moving across the map already, if you're really playing fast, especially with double Oracle The problem with eight gate is that you can't really produce out of eight gate. If you continue producing out of six gate, you get the gates a bit earlier, it's fine You can even fit in a couple of probes easier. Because if you're doing these big pushes, you actually do want to get some probes even if you do kill a third base now really all the harass he's done so far is kill tumors you actually killed not a single drone which is impressive because there's only four queens this middle base is really really vulnerable and even though there's double spores on the sides four queens is not enough because you're only going to have a double queen on one of the bases um oracle should be dealing with these links very very important that you have some is that this is not how you deal with link run bys you can't just leave seven stalks at home dude what do you is you get a single battery and you leave both of your oracles at home or you even just follow the links but this is not what you're supposed to do absolutely not it is half of his army against a run by that might not even happen he sends it over at the right again you still leave sword home yeah this is insane you should never play like this it's a no no that's a he lost an oracle he's playing his 77 drones if he doesn't straight up kill his opponent there's something wrong with the builder you know he's hitting at seven minutes and 20 seconds that's like a solid minute minute 10 seconds too late even with a triple oracle this would be a minute too late a minute and 20 seconds today mean the fight is going well the other guy literally has no units except 17 mutas on the way I feel like his opponent can just pull the drones with the mutas and probably win if he fights this with 70 drones and 17 mutas. He's probably just okay But yeah I mean it does look pretty good There's no pro production behind this Oh he lost his prison His answer was to warp in eight centuries ago I love the decision making Sometimes he's got to love the decision making He sees the mutas Do we have Phoenix production yet? No, not yet So he still believes he can win He's floating a solid 1k 500 during this. Now I understand why he's not building phoenixes in some ways where it's like ah come on there's no way i'm losing this right i killed everything i can kind of dig that it's eight centuries making their way across the map now i mean this this should be kind of okay you just walk over here you kill the workers here you're going to the main kill some workers there and you're completely fine actually he needs to recall at this point yeah do we now have phoenix production okay he finally restarts Pro Production on one of the bases Wait a second He said 16 workers, didn't he? A little prick Hey, check to be sure 16 workers, one base He said, why, he lied. He lied This is 32 workers, that's two base saturation, and there's two bases remaining This changes things This is like, some of you guys probably have kids, yeah? When you have kids, and they got in a fight with another kid, the story of your kid is always going to be that he did nothing, he or she did nothing wrong, and the other kid did everything wrong I remember, I was a kid I always was like, well, he just started punching me for no reason, not telling the fact that he first threw sand at them and called him an annoying prick But this is kind of what my man derivative did here, and I almost just skipped over it This is not one base. This is literally, this is two base There's two bases There's basically two base saturation You lied That's not very nice I don't like that What do you have now? 13 muras, not a single phoenix First phoenix comes out About a minute after he spotted the first mura So there could be about two, three phoenixes out already Now, still fine position Don't get me wrong He's up 17 workers The only thing really lacking is upgrades at this point is batteries in every base A single, yeah, okay, maybe the main base is going to be a bit rough to hold without losing too many workers Should send a couple of stalkers there Some nice anticipation by my men derivative. I see the lessons from last time I haven't been completely learned yet Against the mutas Anticipation is difficult to find in this game, but, you know, I dig it We can live with it He managed to, he lost six workers, okay Unit loss still in favor of a man derivative, and his opponent is not building any drones It's building four now, but that's really it There's two Phoenixes, batteries are good, double Stargate production I wouldn't mind seeing a forge and a Twilight being thrown down at this point I mean, you've got to start thinking about the future Also, plus one on air, probably is a good plan. If you're getting double Stargate Phoenix, plus one helps so much with these double attacks that Phoenixes have I'd really recommend that No worker production for quite a while now I feel like We just see very slow working no chronobo's being used For a second I thought we're gonna get three full energy Nexus I nexus XI But we only have two and then one half full so that's 300 energy Luckily there's nothing that is kind of urgent like chrono boosting health Phoenixes There we go. Yeah, good job We're doing it doing it together 42 works against 38 so income is relatively equal the one thing that probably this is what confused derivative obviously is this guy is on 38 workers but is mining from six gas and it's probably going to be mining from 8 gas soon so it's going to just be able to get a lot of gas out these units are very gas intensive that's actually correct both mutas and investors here we have the pathogen glands of course the energy upgrade for the investors and now at this point the mutas are practically useless if he had plus one at this point he's just going to absolutely blast these Muralis yeah like it's it's just over you can chase them wherever it's just gonna end please that's that's it I like that he doesn't chase he doesn't quite know what's there might be hydras or something hello okay just make sure okay wait what okay he just moved out with everything he was like you know what I have a lead in absolutely everything let me give that up by moving out leaving nothing behind and having eight links kill my eco on the third it's a good plan that's a very good plan where's this guy going i love it okay now warps in a couple of adapts okay set up mining again at this base you say continue worker production there's some slight oversaturation in the natural but it's all good Okay, you see spines on the high ground, you see investors, you see a base over here. This is over Just kill these drones and kill this base, and the game is over It's really as simple as that No? You can lift them, yeah Okay Well, that's it then Israeli probes across the map It was probably for Manor Nexus My man derivative here, he was looking into the future It's such an easy win against these noob flying dragons Okay, now this, this is one of those moments in your life where you have to make a decision And there's really only one correct decision here, and that's recalling If you look at this situation, right, we see two necks eyes still alive We have 34 workers four workers. And on top of that, this represents about 60% of the opponent's army, which is just going to be killed for free if you recall these phoenixes right now Is recall available? Recall is available So all my man derivative here needs to do is recall, chase these bad boys away, reestablish a base. And then you're playing against someone who has five workers in his main base and a bunch of investors and a NIDUS instead what we do we give up the third we give up the natural we move up a ramp into four I feel like he's just doing it to be on the show at this point there's no way you're telling me this is what a grand man ha ha ha ha ha ha ha I'm surprised he doesn't force shoot himself into a smaller square so the fungal can hit more I don't think he's quite hitting enough yet and he still gets in This is the worst part But that is What? So all he wanted to do was kill four. to do was kill four spines Did he just lose his entire army to kill four spines and then teleport out Mission complete This is insane He's flaming him I really want to know what this has I just can't imagine He just walked up a ramp to clear four spines he didn't need to death that's like if if this was a James Bond movie and James Bond does all the things that he does you know he just kill some bad guys lots of fighting gets poisoned by his potential girlfriend and then in the end he just grabbed like a butt scratcher It's like, oh, finally I got what I need and it scratches his butt and throws it out, then walks back. It's like, I feel like you could have just ordered one on Amazon It's like, probably would have been easier Like, was this all really necessary? I, he's actually just going to lose to the mutas But the investor are still here, so under's anitis This is This is insane He's still outmining his opponent as well That's the best part He even could have done that as long as he didn't just give away his phoenixes for free He's going to move out again I mean, he cleared the spines earlier So there's no way these spines have been rebuilt, right? He comes back, there's five spines Dang it, they grow back There's no way My man, the flying dragon That's so painful to watch 47 supply. Goes over, kills an extractor I mean, what's he thinking? What goes on in his mind? Derivative What? What? He thinks it's a base trade, but he forgets there's a base in the main Or I have no clue what he's doing There's a storm on this? No, there's no, there's no, of course not My way, it's for feedback This is the feedback time plan I just don't know what he's doing He's gonna go back, no? If he walks up another There's more There's no way If he keeps going, I just I just know what he was going. doing why would he do the things that he is doing why is another extractor is the third extractor he gets is he's doing good business he left this on the life I believe this at 55 HM did they regain help yeah they go they do it dang it investors what now do you see 2 3 3 3 What am I supposed to say? What actually? Am I supposed to say here? His start was good Well, semi good A lot of things went all right The start wasn't great Some build order mistakes But he got in a great position. then the first move out i already was a little bit suspicious of right he's up like 15 workers against the zirk he hard countered the composition all he needs to do is just like if he gets like four char slots the game is just over you know he can even just harass with the phoenixes at that point but he sends his entire army across the map loses a base in the base trade but even then he's up one base against the zirk that has no units that can fight it has support units and units that are good in base trades so what you do is you just sit at home you get a third third and you win the game. You just get your Archons out or whatever and you just harass with the Phoenix if you want. You can keep him at home to defend the units. It doesn't matter. It didn't do nothing. Then he walks on top of a ramp, actually maximizing the damage the fungals could do, and he loses. I feel like the message didn't quite arrive last time, so I'm going to try it in your own language. You suck my friend and you suck real good. That's it for today. I hope you did enjoy this episode of Is it Imba or do I suck? If you did enjoy it? There's more.

        "text": "Dear Harston, as always, I'm getting shred by protoses This one was higher in MMR, but was doing me whatever he wanted, as to most of any other members of this Inba race, though I think I have played decent game Decent game Yes, I'm tereblah with supply blocks, but all in all, in 200 versus 200, they just do whatever they want Don't have my APMs for controlling all mines Liberator Gov slash Tim, and they do just a move and storm Do I really suck? Eat me A terran player in diamond on the EU server 3 7K MMR And he's playing against Mr Mover. Now the question really is, does he suck or is Storm plus A move just a little bit to Imba? A good question to ask, of course A lot of people complain about Storm We see that a nice little conversation This guy is very friendly My man Mover over here with the question where the opponent is from Whenever people ask me too many questions, I'm a little suspicious that there might be a gate on my side of the map or a proxy star gate on my side of the map, but you see me scouting around this base of music, like, I am trusting this crap Scouts as well Opens up with a gas first here, by the way It's a little bit interesting. Not a very common build anymore, but definitely still playable Now SCV Scout with gas first is rather uncommon, but once again, Again, we can forgive him for this Reaper starts, orbital as well as command center On the other end, we see core first from our Was this core first? It looks like next before core actually Next before core from our ProDos player Why is this CC? Legit 15 seconds too late I don't know what happened here And I don't know why my music isn't play. but this is really quite confusing for no apparent reason his cc is just 15 seconds too late and this is this is the level where I'm expecting cc's to be in time you know two seconds late well we can live with it but this this is pushing it factory reactor finishing up as well as we have my man movers gonna lose this probe for free? No, Eatme decides he has more important things to do, let's the probe return back to his family Solid Krona was there Classic Absolute classic, I love it All right We see the factory actually, uh, finishing up This is also really late. This, was he just AFK for the first 10 seconds? The Hellions are supposed to be out at like 304, 305, but they're only just starting I don't understand why I'm not quite the build order expert though We actually, actually, we have a different guy for that John? Are you there? Kevin? I told you I'm on holiday, you idiot Don't ever call me again while I'm on holiday I have one week off a year and this is what you do? When I come back I'm gonna punch you so freaking your valuable input I guess Yeah, let's just continue with the game as we have the first Oracle on the way Did our friend Reaper Man see anything? Now, didn't see anything, of course. Didn't manage to properly get in playing against Stalker Stalker Now he does have two cars which he decided instead of sending across the map he's going to leave at home He follows up with two more cars So it's going to get four cars, no starport, another barracks Now, I've seen a build like this before, but in that case it was always played with a star port He's also not producing marines consistently at all He's going to need two mines to deal with this Oracle That's the standard But because his reactor or factory oscillate, I don't even think that's going to work Doesn't he just lose to one Oracle here? I mean. three marines no units in position what and then loses six workers and his heliens scale okay you get some kills with the hellings as well that's good so seven workers killed on the one side nine workers killed on the other but he's down 15 workers which means he also hasn't been producing workers, he isn't producing workers right now And he gets a tech lab for a factory on a cyclone that is too late for any air unit This is like putting on the condom after the fact It's like this doesn't help anymore, my friend Why would she even do this? You already got your SDD Like, this cyclone is absolutely nothing Well, it's still good to have, obviously, but You're already sick. Um, three more It's game is just over I mean, there's six adepts and three Seven adapts, three oracles Six marines and a cyclone And he's also like double the workers He kills the turret My man mover mover Okay, these guys are out of energy, I guess that helps Cyclone actually saving the day here That's nice I think should cancel this, yeah Just kill this I mean, he's getting a third base as well It's looking really good for mover Okay, so this is gonna get cleaned up in the end Unis lost up looking relatively even, but my man, eat me here, has been. man eat me here hasn't produced a worker ever since the Berlin Wall fell so he's in a supply block as well I don't even know how he can get supply locked after he's been attacked for this long didn't lose a depot right I wonder what this time supply block will be at the end of this game editor that's counted just you know we updated in in 30 seconds second increments so you don't have to do too much work Because nothing is better than a job half done His wife must love him So close, honey, so close One one on the way here for Mover Who is a Mover is continuing with his life, he knows. Like, well, I sent over some adepts, some oracles and killed a bunch of workers, but he's not he's not one to reminisce about the past he's like you know what's in the past is in the past right now I'm happy just producing more units and making probes my men eat me still thinking about those adept absolutely destroying his life the first oracle taking out 10 workers and here comes the cyclone 43 HP so half a shot of a sensory will get a boom Nice! It's a good move out here Magually floating 1,200 minerals jutting all of this as well Oh man, this is so good Um Thurc on the way This is the terran way of dealing and floating money, by the way. You just built like four structures Like I wasn't I was in floating cash This was planned in the build order All right, buddy Four marauders are out 101 supply against 57 66 workers against 37 The fact that the Terran believes he's still entitled to this game Should tell you everything about that race and the people that play it Holy crap Like, movers have been playing a good game He has so many workers He's getting upgrades He's Corona Boosting Wall as well Moover is I like Mover I'm not a big fan of the structures he's building sometimes, but his macro is tight Like he's doing things, getting a fourth base He doesn't give a crap. He also isn't like, all right, I don't want to finish the game yet, you know? He wants to get all the units here Man, my man, mover I'm a fan What do you have, charge, 1-222-2 on the way, Disruptor, maybe some Templar as well He's just getting every unit in the boot When Mover opens the game, you just goes through like the, you know, little guide you got with the game when you bought it in 2010 There's not even disruptors in there He's like, oh, what are you not sure I built today? And he just scrolls through the pages as the game progressed I just don't look cool as well Bam, builds it It's get so sick. Armory, seven turrets, casual, because he has plenty of money laying around anyway He's down 30 workers He thinks seven turrets at this point is a wise investment Perfect defense against multi-prong Only sacrificed two and a half command center for it Actually more Now it's two and a half, about two and a half Hey, this is so sick What the hell? One Viking here probably would have done a similar job and keeping a Marine here and a Marine here I mean, he's on two base It's not like, like there's not going to be too much multi-prong here You know, you just move your army to your main at this point I have a feeling, Eat Me, isn't going to move out in a name. next 10 minutes either He hasn't really done anything except for that one move out with the cyclone Nice tank position Yeah, never mind guys Okay, you realize, he realized We can forgive it I'll take back that I tried to make fun of you there I'll take it back I mean, he's just not doing anything He's not scouting He's not producing workers, but nothing is happening. So what is he doing? Is he one of those guys with two screens and it's just watching anime on the other screen or something like that you know the final episode of Naruto like on repeat on the side seems like the kind of guy that would do that some repeat just looping again and again solid disruptor drop we can forgive him he has so much more money honestly if I was mover and my opponent wouldn't be leaving I just constantly be sending in disruptor drops into my opponent's marine to tell him to leave So something I do as well is just sending units for fun. Todd once showed me a replay which he played against an N-A-Theron where the N-A-Therent just wouldn't leave and kept camping on three bays with a planetary as natural as a third and he kept just move commanding like 12 immortals and 10 Arcons into his opponent's planetaries just dancing it back and forth, never attacking anything until eventually I think Todd maxed out on 180 army supply and just aim moved into the guy that absolutely blasted him It's like a 45 minute game of Todd just move commanding units in again and again and again He sent me the replays the cab have a look at this What do you think? Todd is so cool, man Double Ghost Academy. Because this really is the kind of game where he can afford a new court too Supply He only has one thing to pay attention It's not like he's been controlling his army or thinking about what type of composition to get Like how's, this is a I'm supply block, let me start a CC Gets more supply than a depot Also, only takes about seven times as long to build, but It's got a double depot drop There we go And starts two depots that you will still supply blocked after Imagine being so supply blocked that you instantly are supply block again after He's going to be able to get one round of SCD He's 51 SCVs Oh my God. I'm so curious how long this guy has been supply block This is really impressive He's also, okay, he's getting 2-2 Why did he get the second Academy? All right Little, little game show segment Ding-da-ding-ding ding Ding ding ding ding ding ding Hello and welcome to the IOTUS game show Today we have a question for the audience and the question is will we see any use out of that second Ghost Academy or is it just there for show? We have two answers Answer A Yes, we're going to be seeing both Ghost Academies used and answer B No, we're not going to be seeing two Ghost Academies used Stay tuned for the answer That sure is a good question A couple of salads. Just throwing a marauder here and there I mean, this is, it's not looking good for a turn friend Let's just be honest here, guys This is, this is not looking to, I love the CC in here as well, pretending that he still wants to expand He has a single meta vac now, four meta-vex Okay, he's dropping An empty one as well for moral support The third wheel Well, your best friend and his girlfriend are making out in the backseat This guy is driving the car Completely sober as a half course Don't drive and drink, guys That's messed up He got left behind They had better things to do They really only use this guy for his car. If you're the person in that situation right now, it's still time to stop These people are not your friends There's more people out there What's this? 24 Marauders 2-2 upgrades, drilling claws, because he's really been doing a lot of mine harassed a lot of mine harass and it's been moving these mines around the bunch and it makes a lot of sense to get that upgrade Floated, another supply block What? He's actually just constantly supply blocked While doing nothing Well, where was I? Here, I was here Maybe you should cut this out This fight is looking interesting from the ProDos I'm not quite sure about that one but he's plenty of money I don't mind it for now. It's literally one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and he's taking Wait, I can't count One, two, three, four, five, six, seven Eight base, eight potential bases against currently three He's ready for the double drop as well I feel like he has a little bit of money to spare But honestly, the fights, the one thing that EidMe has been complaining about, haven't really been going that poor I mean, he's just, he's doing so much better in the fights, like twice as efficient And he has an army composition of Marines marauders and unseed liberators So I feel like he can't really be complaining about Storm here I mean, maybe I'm the crazy one In my mind that seems like a Like a bold play. We'll see if it pays off for him Biron's gonna go Oh, the Disruptor drop This is a classic I like this one Is this gonna be the second one? I just What are we doing here? Oh Like how both players are just managing this little area Forgetting about the rest of the game the rest of the game is like this the most important interaction they've ever had and then the one DT just ruins it dang it T T T Tee. Okay this base gets cleaned up so Eatme is gonna be pretty happy about himself here I guess right now it's only six base against four 55 works against 81 how is he up in income I feel like my man mover should have sent in this replay hello I have six bases and 81 workers, Taryn just mines more than me How's that possible? I wonder if Emi is ever going to do something this game Oh, mine hits That's an interesting move Toast Academy hasn't been used yet, by the way And he's not really hitting too many storms So this This fight looted really good for the, yeah, 17K against 8 2K. I have a feeling, Eatme doesn't quite realize that the reason that he lost was A, he was actual light years behind, B, he doesn't do anything in the game See, he's been consistently, oh, he can't get supply blocked anymore I hope he loses the depot to see how long it takes him to rebuild one depot So this is most likely the final time of being supply blocked But perhaps we could He also, why did he speak about having ghost when there's 10 arcons and he doesn't have a single ghost ready? Flies away with two metaphics Oh look at that third wheeling friend still He keeps doing it There's not a matter fact here either 19k He's literally twice as cost efficient. How does he complain about? And all he uses is Marauders without Medivacs And he complains? His arm, his opponent is like this He's crafting these composition Seven Archons here Some Zealots Some Storms This guy just Marauder Marauder go brr What the hell? He's building sophisticated compositions My man mover here with Storms and a single Disruptor Like, how is Epeme complaining about this? Actually, actually, I think I might know the reason for why Eatme is complaining about Storms This is a little thing called Terran syndrome, Terran whining syndrome And I could explain it to you, but I actually have a reporter who can do just that Nikola Skundening Are you here? Yes, hello, Kevin. We're here in the hospital at a specialized hospital ward for the Terran Wining Syndrome I'm wearing a mask this because the air here is filled with sodium and if you inhale too much sodium there is a chance that you will dehydrate So just to make sure I am wearing that mask now Terran Wining Syndrome of course We've been seeing a lot more in the past seven, eight years, in which Terrans really believe that they deserve to win the game after sitting and doing nothing for five to six minutes They're defending their drops perfectly because nothing is going on And then they whine a lot They keep whining, they keep whining. They start whining to their friends, their family, their spouses, their husbands, their wives And it completely destroys their life Constant salt pouring out of their ears and their nose And that is what all of these people that are right here have to deal with I'm feeling my lips starting to get a little bit dry, Kevin And honestly, I don't think I can hold much longer So back to you with the rest of this I owe this Always great a talk with my man, Nicholas Now we have Okay, look at this fight No No no no no medevax Okay, these tanks, have they seen any action yet? He's getting his first few shots in This tank position has been atrocious, by the way. They should, of course, be on the low ground at this point If you're defending this area This fight still was, I think, semi in favor of Eat Me Or at least an efficient fight for both Like, it's a fine fight, you know? And once again, just pure marauder against Storm, Arcon, and a disruptor to end with He hasn't built a ghost. Why did he refer to ghosts? like it was something that he built it's too much to control I had battle cruisers and ghosts and liberators and Vikings and the guy just built marauders and mines well marauders and yeah literally marauders mines and some leftover liberators every now and he actually has a good army he probably gets used to fight at this point if he just gets like too closed with this he probably would just be able to EMP and then win no Scan I mean, the way that mover is fighting is really You could have known it in the lobby screen because it's in his name, like he's just moving a lot of the time It's not really fighting. Just moves in with a bunch of units, like, hmm, interesting 30K against 20K What's this, 8 base? Every much, my count is so difficult Holy crap So glad I managed to finish elementary school school, it was a tight call though If I would graduate from elementary school or not But, I mean, after I was done with that, I knew I never had school again in my life So that was very nice Nice run by He's not going to do anything here I feel like mover might just be throwing away his lead here a little bit He means, he's still nice He's going to try to expand over here again Eat me, eat me, eat me What do we have over here? Nexie nexus. People have been complaining that I say nexie instead of nexus I'm not sure if I'll fix that Some of these things Oh, he actually lost the wheat Is there glaves? I love this This is the type of harass I want to see In the late game, the quality 25 adept run by that's shooting a single lip Or shooting a single refinery Okay, Eadmi is not allowed to complain His traits have been absolutely bananas He's up 15K in resources lost He has the super bunkers He is a bunker over here still Tanks are still on the high ground This Ghost Academy has never been used, by the way I don't think it's ever going to get used He's now mining from the left side. I think Eatmy is winning really hard at this point I think he can actually just move across the map and win the game He has triple the army supply You think he realizes? Why is he complaining? man if I was mover I'd be fuming it's like literally outmine my opponent about like 40k still can't win and then this guy starts talking as well builds three turrets in case one wasn't enough for the detection like mover better start taking some real good fights or or my man eat me is over you know it's that's it Come on, some disrupt the shots You can do it, move, okay He's back on 100 supply, or 200, but a 100 army supply. Now, this might be the fight that Eatme has been referring to Just forgets all the other fights that he had in the game It's like, oh, this one fight was really broke and I lost it Three Metavax, 31 marauders, 35 Marines Why did he pretend like he was using the mines and the Liberators? There's like 30 army supply on the right side here Like legit just not doing anything Was that like six liberators? Four mines Eight liberators not doing anything This guy's actually kind of shooting Why was EidMe pretending like he was microing many things? He's microing a single control group He doesn't have, he never built a ghost. And now he's gonna lose a fight most likely against a guy who's using three control groups using three control groups, one for Disruptor, one for Templar See, Eden he's winning this fight as well It's a semi-even trait With the worst army composition and half his army on the other side of the map He's not even replacing anything What is he doing at this point? He's just looking at the planetary Oh, I'm repairing it Oh, it just died What goes on in his head? Who? Send back my SUV I wonder if any units that I could use to defend this fight What about these? He has them selected He's just F2ing at this point, not realizing what he has. He don't really know what you've got till it's gone I don't know what this is, guys at this point though he's dead at this one but he had a single control group never how does he complain about difficult control he doesn't even know what control is he literally just f2ed with a bunch of siege units i don't think he's allowed to win the fight in the end 51k against 30 20k difference He lost depots so he might actually be able to This could be it He could start getting supply blocked again That's the dream He's gonna move out now See these DTs? They're like, oh, they're broken Does he lose it? I've been a few big. Come on shoot! This game is so close Holy crap E supply against 17 But a lot of the supply is never going to get used because he forgot the unseech hotkey I have no clue what I'm watching, honestly No Gigi, no skill No Gigi, no skill He left While up 30 army supply This is fantastic No Gigi, no skill I have something for you, my friend But first, let's go for this musical interruption This is my song Now it's time to balance wine by Kevin the Koen and Bob Dylan One, two, three, four They flew into sports, Marines, what is a splash? I have 308 p m They keep pretending that I'm flash I just knew his entire army. Oh no crap, that was mine Now I lost another letter game and it's time to Balance wine Oh I almost forgot You suck dude Yeah you do Don't forget subscribe to my YouTube channel More videos and see you all next time for a new I-O-this Bye-bye Full song coming out somewhere next week once I get my low E-string My high E-string Don't worry, guys I got it."

        "text": "Dear Harstam, the current state of ZVP frustrates me greatly I tried really hard in that game I felt like my unit composition of Queen Corruptor Viper with 1-2 Ultras and a couple of links was the correct match for the Skytos However, it was really hard to shut down his expansions due to cannons and batteries Despite all my attempts, I was out-expended and out-traded Please tell me how this is not imbalanced Cheers, RealGan Realgan is a Zirk Grandmaster player from Europe He's playing against Hulk, who is, I believe, a Russian toss I'm not actually sure what country Realgan is from opening up with a 12-pooh, safe and solid macro play Hulk, I know Hulk, also known as Genie. And I play against America now and then He's a cannon rusher and a Skytos camper, basically He is everything that everyone hates on ladder So seeing a replay of these two guys makes me extremely happy It seems like Relgan has some complaints about Skytals Now, I do agree that Skytos can be very frustrating to deal with, especially Voidre Carrier Tempest, with a bunch of a mothership and a bunch of Templar underneath This is right now the composition that Tos has, which actually is very good for Tos And as a Zirk, it can be very good difficult to do it I agree with that I'm not sure if that's what Hulk plays It's possible that Hulk just plays pure Skydos like Voidre Carrier. That type of stuff usually just gets kind of easily countered by investors, some combination of investors and what do you call them, vipers As long as there's no high templars really easy But even with High Templar, if there's no tempest, Zir can almost always find good engagements Now, opens up with a 12 pool, gets the hatch down decent time I think Hulk opened with Nexus first or something like that or tried the cannon rush He seems to have a very weird opener here You should cancel this forge And then he's probably just fine Okay, it doesn't cancel the forge So this is a bunch of minerals there for nothing Cannon is up though and this gate. Oh actually the gate can be attacked at a certain location yeah it's just testing right now i think there's another spot over here up top i think two links can definitely attack this oh cybercore goes down double hatch behind this i feel like if you see the cyber core as this late you can actually delay your second gas and you can play double gas later on so you can still get speed later on but it's not necessary to get it quickly because this cyber core is so late by the time two adapts are out you're going to have like five queens already so I'm actually not a massive fan of this fast gas RELGAN also immediately sees a very fast third gas, which. This is 4 gas at once I've never seen this in my life before This is not a build But the RELGAN did spot that, so he should know that most likely it's just going to be either MESS Phoenix or MESS Oracle, MES void, right? It's going to be something air with air that requires a lot of gas So you just know it's Target already I actually feel like at this point he. shouldn't be mining gas at all he has two queens so far he's not injecting with either of them there we go took his time moving into a supply block soon but for now yeah there's a lot of larva available he's actually just supply block yeah finishes up that's nice so a tiny supply block i mean these are small mistakes but they do add up over time but on the end with hulk i don't know what he's doing at all obviously Building random pilots Make sure he doesn't die to Nidus His eco is still slightly better than Rilgan, for some reason I have no clue how that actually happened It's not like this. I guess RELGEN either wasn't injecting or macroing or just was supply block for a long time Like he's supposed to be in a better spot worker wise than 36 to 32 He's now catching up, of course, as the queen start popping, more and more. larva out now we have the first stargate plus one starts before the stargate finishes i love that and this setup if i'm real gang here um i mean i see a zealot a sentry and a void ray what you're what you do here is you get like seven eight links like this and then you just get a bunch of queens like five to six queens you get a lot of drones just constantly be pumping out drones hitting all your injects spreading a lot of creep you never get a rotor against it's never in a million years there's absolutely no use you see this guy's opening up with void ray his stack is super delayed you're not even sure if this is a warp gate i mean if it is warp gate it's going to be the slowest warp gate in the world you can just hold this with whatever layer tech you're planning to get in my opinion that should be hydras unless you 100 know your opponent is playing ericles but then the rotor the rotor never makes sense um yeah I think you just go to layer, get plus one, and then get hydras. And you can just, what you can do against most of these builds is you just get like seven, eight queens Then you get hydras with plus one and you get bailings And you just kill your opponent It's actually impossible to hold without storm You hit at like 740, 750 with like 160 supply And you always beat these builds every single time Especially if they rush straight the carrier It's awful Because their DPS is so little You can just kill the interceptors You have enough hydras to do that If you have hydros with plus one and you have a bunch of queens for tanking and transfuses, there should be no problem So, RealGan built too many links. This type of stuff, I mean, it can work It's just gimmicky, right? If there's an Oracle here or there's two more zealots, you just wasted six drones, basically It is going to work out this time, so it actually gets a cancel on the base Hulk is like, okay, I'm just going to expand over here We have a fort base on the way for RealGan. All of this so far is pretty good If he was planning on getting hydra then he should have played a range upgrades honestly These days hydra bane unless it's for a straight timing isn't actually that popular anymore because bainings lost a lot of their power like the macro variant of hydra bane Now we have spire Is this loco? He's gonna play Hydra Corruptor 22 more links 22 more links makes absolutely zero sense as well Should have been 10 more drones Because there's no ground units, actually zero ground units He's already seen the carriers now So all he needs to do is not die against the carriers And he actually, like he should be at 80 workers at this point already. On 8 gas, but instead he's building links and rallies them into a cannon and a void, right? Once again, this can work, but really it shouldn't I actually think it's going to work, though Oh my God, he gets another cancel I hate it when this happens He's going to lose a base in return No way, right? And it's just two carriers There's no way Yeah, there's no way Right? This moves across the map with the three hydras He's going to trade a base for a base, which actually is a good thing He's floating 2K minerals as well, as well as 900 gas I mean, I understand that he's floating a thousand gas because he wants to be getting corruptors, I guess. Or Muda Lisk maybe I have no clue His play staccount makes no sense But the 1K minerals is pretty painful He's not re-expanding to the left side or re-expanding here Now, finally, my man Halk is re-expanding This is doing way too much damage If this carrier dies, I'm going to be upset Okay, doesn't die He lost all of his queens now, so he literally only has 68 words workers and 13 corruptors on the way This is awful Three more queens It's like, ah, maybe a spore I bet he's real glad about the plus one melee that he has right now It's going to be real useful this game Two carriers, three fighters. Can he fight this? It's what nine corruptors? I guess he can now Yeah, it's going to get one, two corruptors for free There's plus one as well on this It actually makes them a lot scarier three Voidre is on the way Fleetbegan I think Hulk is in a very, very good position right now Even though he lost his third base three, four times, real gun has absolutely no eco, he has no units, he has no upgrades, and he doesn't even have any queens I mean he has three right now He's finally rebuilding this fourth base at eight minutes in I guess he's going to be able to do a little bit of damage Fourth base goes down for Hulk as well. this is good so you get into the main base and then you can pick off like the guys that come to rescue it so he gets two Void Rays for a single Corruptor which is always a nice thing i think now he stays a little bit too long and this straight ends up going pretty poor plus two wasn't quite done yet but it was close i don't know it i feel like at this point he shouldn't be be doing this anymore what you want to do is you want to pick it off while they're, so you do a run by to the third base or something. And as they're flying, you pick off a unit from the side because void rays are faster than carriers, you know, you can pick off a carrier from behind, something like that No scouting, outer real gang, that there's a potential fort base There should be a link here There should be a link here There should be a link here Making sure that no extra expansions can be built He's still only on 72 workers So, and he's mining from a base that hasn't finished yet with his extra workers It's like 10, 10 more workers than it. opponent and he uses all of them to long distance mine so in reality eco is completely even upgrades are way ahead here for hulk is plus two against no upgrades on air like the ground upgrades are completely irrelevant these links are not going to be able to trade with cannons most likely if this base actually gets cannons he said i had a difficult time denying base as well yeah it's because she didn't try if you start denying a base if there's ten cannons yeah it's a lot more difficult but this nexus build which is like seven seconds, then he built pilots and just now he's adding his cannons. Like, he's had basically two full minutes to try and deny his base, and he isn't even aware it's up yet Just keeps focusing on whatever he's already doing He finally gets his gases, but Hulk already has gas as well So actually, income is completely even still Worker count is equal Zirk, at this point, should have his hive done, should be a double spire, 95 workers, 10 gas. but a real gun just keeps building Ling Corruptor and then just runs around the map trying to do damage and every time he does damage he'll kill like five workers and then he loses three four corruptors and 20 lynx so it's like he's doing damage but he doesn't have more eco than his opponent and he's losing more money-wise as well so actually all of these trades probably yeah are not in favor of RealGen at all Right now, Hulk is actually ahead in trades, and I think the eco has been pretty similar. The only thing is that Hulk is investing so much in static defense that even though he lost more, even though Real Gun lost more army value-wise, he's actually still in a playable position Finally, he's going up to 86, 91 worker, second spire This is like, this is three, four minutes too late Two, three minutes too late, I think When he started his fourth base, his fifth base basically should be saturated already with ten guys. but because he kept building random links it didn't happen also losing the queen sauce of course a big pepeg move here we go 98 workers this is good then you just get vipers at this point once again this base is gonna go up without really being contested at all at this point another thing you can do by the way is if you have very good eco you can start doing bailing run bys like just busting like seven eight banlings in here then doing a Ling run by, but only after you have good eco So what Real Gan did here is he started harassing a lot and then got good eco, but you can just do it the other way around. So first get good eco and then start harassing It's exactly the same Probably would do more damage with the second one, and you actually have an advantage in that case So this is a bad fight most likely for Hulk There's a lot of queens There's a bunch of corruptors here As long as you just not fight into the prismatic alignment here, you're going to be having a really good time as a RELGun He did fight a little bit in the Prismatic Alignment, so I still think this fight was pretty poor, actually, for Valgun On top of that, this upgrades still suck hard as well But queens are extremely powerful against Void Race No transfuses being used Yeah, there's one transfuse Good. Yeah, this was a good fight Like I said, if you just fight after prismatic alignment is gone, you're usually going to have a very good time You're just Corruptors actually trade very well against Voidray carrier if there's no prismatic alignment and if there's a couple of queens around So he loses a base and a bunch of workers Another base for Hulk is up And at this point, a real gun should be realizing that it's time to add some casters as well You know, either investor or viper What I like to see initially is viper, so you can fly around with your corruptor viper You pull a unit to you, you kill it. And then you go into investors if you ever want to have a big fight It seems like Ryokan doesn't quite agree with it as he just keeps building corruptors He's like, huh I wonder what the counter is to mass Void Re Maybe a unit that is armored and takes more damage from prismatic alignment That sounds all right Here come 23 corruptors This is a fight I actually don't know who will win Okay, well, if the Voidray's pop, then Hawk is going to win You see, Hulk completely outmining his opponent at this point, just by building cannons at base, all these bases, by the way, quick pass You look at these bases and you think, hey, this is pretty secure. But in reality, this is just three cannons So if you send a decent amount of links here, or if you just, like I said, send a couple of banings, he already has plus two at this point, you're just going to blast this base There's no walls It's not 12 cannons Like here, also only three cannons. These bases are really, really easy to harass and they're super out of the way for Hulk to defend um like you said sometimes it feels as a Zirk player that there's not a lot you can do in these cases it's like oh there's cannons everywhere but then you look at it's like well it's three cannons like you send in eight banlings here they're going to kill every single probe then you send like 10 links and they clean up the cannons behind it as well like this is absolutely not a powerful defense at all absolutely not um two two upgrades plus three is done more Stargates on the way for Hulk Real gun is just, I mean, real gun is just down 30 supply. I, yeah, he's just in a bad spot, honestly He's really just been in a bad spot Ever since the start when he decided that he didn't need a fort base to fight against the toss that is camping on three I feel like he's been in a poor position He's also just been He's also just been sending his corruptors around the map Again and again without any type of finesse, you know This is the caveman way of playing Wait, what? Does he have links and corruptors in the same group? I think he's just F2ing, honestly Okay, no, he has a separate group I think he just F2s a lot, because they were moving together. Now, what he should have been doing, like I said, is try to split up your opponent's attention Like, these bases are like backdoor attacks Imagine you have a scenario where your opponent has a fort Okay And the fort is surrounded by land and it's not on a hill And this, this, this, this fort is castle This, it has a, it has one and it has two entrance doors There's one in the front that's where there's five machine guns in front of that front door And the moment you walk in front of that front door, the machine guns start shooting And then you have a door in the back And there there's a guy with a revolver You have six bullets in the revolver. It's one of the old-school ones, like in the Wild West He's never used a gun before either My Man Real Gun keeps trying to burst into the front door again and again, into the bases where there's eight, nine cannons and with the machine guns, the void rays, the carriers While this backdoor of the castle of the fort is completely undefended, except for the one guy with the revolver that never shot before And he just keeps going back again and again Stupid machine guns so broken Oh yeah This castle is impenetrable That's the word Like, this makes absolutely no sense to me And the beautiful thing is if you go through the back door of the castle, the machine guns will need to move. This analogy is going a bit too far These guys will need to move And then you can pick them off with your corruptor viper from the side You have like a changeling over here, a changeling over here You see a move You see the carriers are behind You can pick maybe a voidway from the front or a carrier from the back, whatever you want Maybe you can pick off the mothership as this unit is so big Like, if you accidentally click somewhere on the screen, you will abduct the mothership with your viper Now, there's not a single sport either, but that's just because his eco sucks and has been sucking for a very long time. Still has the links in his army, by the way I love it He builds 69 69 links There's not a single ground unit here He's like, huh Huh Huh Huh Huh Huh Huh Huh Huh Oh If StarCraft had MVP awards, these links definitely wouldn't get it You know, through the process of elimination, you can quickly realize that it's not going to be the links that win Like, this army just had 35 supply in links It had 70 links, right? That's 35 supply 35 supply Yeah That did absolutely nothing in the fight His total army supply was 90 One third of his army was useless It just did nothing It just was It wasn't there Like. And the rest of his army gets hard countered by this Just like void race and carriers and a mothership Like void race hard counter corruptors I'm pretty sure if we open the corruptor tab Look at this Weak against the void ray The void ray is strong against the corruptor You see that? All Vielgun needed to do was open up the Blizzard Help Tap This is What does it say about the circling? At the circling, does it say strong against Voidre? Because if it does I will apologize? No, strong against marauder, hydra and stalker It can't shoot up The circling doesn't have an anti-air attack Do you understand that real again? This is important for me that you understand this. Now, what we could have built, look It's the investor Strong against? The Voidre Also strong against the carrier It doesn't say it here, but it is also strong against the carrier It has this ability called Neurro Parasite in which parasite in which for a two-supply unit, the investor, you can take the Protos, big supply, six-supply unit, the carrier for free And then after you use it, you can still throw a fungal as well It will fight on your side You get that? Fungal, great against units that clump, and then look at this What does it say at the viper? It doesn't say it's strong against the void ray It's also strong against the void ray Parasitic bomb. But he still doesn't have a single viper? How's that even possible? He already started with Ultra He felt like his links last fight didn't quite do a good enough job of clearing all the ground So instead what he decided to do was to make an ultra to clear the many ground unit that Hulk has The sentry in the wall This is as incomprehensible He's just messing corruptors on a worse economy, wondering he's getting hard countered by a unit that hard counters the corruptor You know there's actually a trick with Viper Corruptor? Let me tell you this trick. This works great against higher carrier accounts especially, and I mean this is just a higher carry What you do is, first of all, you send in the ultra first Look at this guy Look at the damage he's doing, the mental support he's providing Dumpidum, Pidum Pompidon Is he actually winning this fight? I have no clue what Hulk is doing here, to be honest I think he's going to recall this No, okay So there is a trick, listen to this What you can do as a Zirk player, If you're playing against someone that actually builds no Templar, this becomes even better But even if they do have Templar, it's good. If they don't have tempest, which you can do, is you can paracitic bomb an opponent's carrier, then you fly into the carrier with all your corruptors And then because of the splash of the parasitic bomb, all the interceptors that are attacking the corruptors that are within the carrier, and thus the parasitic bomb, will just die. And because interceptors don't have too much HP, the interceptors actually die very very fast right now real gun is like dang it ah if only i could deny these bases somehow but real guy or hulk is just too fast i mean he built the nexus and then 50 seconds later he built the cannons i want to also get your guys attention that really relgun has been having full map control the entirety of the game like he had decent pretty good creep spread he knew exactly what was going on he just never wanted to scout for bases he only scouts bases after there's 17 cannons he's like the crappy spider senses you know he's like the type of guy whose gut starts tingling once he's already in jail but like caught by the bad guy if there ever was a spider man movie made about real gun you're like oh my spidey senses start tingling and he starts looking around just gets clubbed on the head The movie ends. Spider-Man died They all this is crap I run angry Box office 200,000 Budget of the movie like 5 million but it should be a crap movie Absolute spider senses of a donkey They don't have spider senses Oh, here comes Yes I was almost afraid he didn't have an ultra with his army I wonder if he thinks that Ultras might have an aura around them, you know, plus 10 attack damage or something like that In Warcraft 3 you have the Kodo and there's war drums You can get more damage Let's just add some links as well. It's like, you know what I'm really missing in my composition right now? What do you think? Infestors? Maybe more Vipers or extra Corruptors? Maybe some Banelings for her run by? Yeah, maybe an Ultralisk and 30 Lings That sounds all right Okay, here we go again I like how he, I want to actually show this move because I thought this was great So he just saw that there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine That there's ten cannons over here Okay? And he's right now in this location Okay, let's just follow this army It's like, huh, I can't really do much on the left side What was there on the right side again? Take dumpy-dumpi-d-p-don Actually, let's go into his vision. Like, okay, let's go I think we can have it Okay, he's cowls, ten cannons Oh! Still 15 cannons now He added five Well, that's still too much Ten was too much Fifteen is too much Maybe I should check again in half an hour It's like, what are you doing? Like, you're not going to break this with pure Ling Ultra Like you need something that does splash Bainlings, for example Bainlings, for example I love that the corruptors always fly with his army as well Of course, they want to profit from that the war drums aura that the Ultralisk has Did he actually I thought he unbinded his vipers for a second, but he didn't. Okay, now this final fight, for once, we're not going to follow the Ultra because the ultra is actually doing damage I didn't, I can't believe it Let's see what he's going to do with this army So throws a parasitic bomb, one Loses three vipers Cast a single parasitic bomb I don't even know how that's possible I really don't I find it impressive I mean, this This is the type of game, you know? I always tell people, I think Skytos is quite good I do think it's good I think it's difficult to deal with Don't get me wrong Especially at the lower levels Like anything below like 6K, you know? Like the top guys, they're pretty good at dealing with it. But even for them, it's really difficult And Skytos can feel really easy to play But this Skytos is not good There was no Templar There was no Tempest like the problem here was just that he tried to basically link corruptor all in in the midgame then got behind economically and then for the rest of the game tries to counter void race with corruptors and ultras I kind of want to make like a chart for him where it's like does it shoot up and then do I make it versus Airtles and then the answer is no if it doesn't shoot up you don't build it versus Airtles unless you're killing probes with it I'm honestly confused why he sent this replay. I mean, he's a grandmaster player He should understand at least the, you know, the interactions between units that can shoot up and can shoot up, between spellcasters and carriers Not having a single investor makes zero sense to me Not having a single sport on the map the entire time, not rushing 95 drones in the early game and actually being behind in Eco against a guy with zero ground units Why do you keep walking into machine guns real bad? Why? I don't understand I don't think you understand this game either So, I have two things for you First of all, read on the unit counters a little bit There's a very helpful help tap, F12 in game You can see what unit counters what. It's not always accurate, but it's going to do a better job than what you showed us this game And second of all, you suck pathetic performance All right, guys, that's going to be it for today I hope you did enjoy this episode of Is it Inba or Do I Suck? And I hope to see you all next time for a new one Bye-bye."

        "text": "Dear Harston, I'm a big fan of your channel My complaint is going to be a little bit odd I was playing against Zirk The game was smooth I was up in basis count Upgrades You name it I got it Keeping the Zerk under pressure, denying his hatcher ass But suddenly he went to Brutelords and smashed my army 3 3 Marine did nothing I went to produce tours, but I was playing bio and snipers are suck So hard to keep it alive Countroll, gas heavy and to transpose into Mac It's such a risky move I'm not saying that Groot Lords are Inba, but that the ability for Zirk to transpose into whatever he likes, with only one building is so opie. You can just build it to trap me or to go massive Taran, by the way, cannot do that, no space, costs a lot of money, yeah, and time P S I'm just a platinum league player Please don't go too hard on me Thanks Is it inbaer, do I suck? Welcome everyone to a new episode of is it in bar or do I suck from a man who hasn't been able to quite locate the period on his keyboard That was a very, very long sentence I'm going to need to take a quick breeder Now, we have my man Lightov here, who is a platinum zerk, platinum level terran player on Europe And he's not doing a. Wait, this depot started at 13, didn't it? He cut one SUV too early Oh no, it's going to be one of them games You know, it's not that bad, actually build the barracks, rally towards, if he rallies towards the gas, I'll forgive him Ah, and not forgiven I love it when things like rallying happen It just makes the game look smooth, but you have to click it manually like a loser Not a fan of it, not a fan of it, but it's like scout timing as well I say scout timing, this is going to be some proxy, isn't it? Oh God, no I really don't want this I really hope this isn't a proxy. The problem with this is, is that this proxy is going to, now, he's just got, his scout, look at his movement He's even already, bang, bang, going to the third, going back home He's at a rally point He's like, I ain't doing that stuff no more Okay, so they have a Marine first He's going to snip an overlord Okay, I like it No orbital command Nice. Who needs an orbit? all right am i right le Mayo guys just get the CSC is down yes sure we can't mule but build a CC my friend here we go orbital now no no it's more it's more SUVs man depot yeah I get the depot first I don't understand how he's this close to being supplied like he's lacking money but I'm not sure why he must have done something really wrong but he has no cash whatsoever he's supposed to be to afford a factory at this point and get straight reactor on this barracks as well As if he comes back home after a successful scouting mission. Actually, if I think back of his post, what was the complaint? The complaint was that Zirk can transpose too easily And the Zerk, the Brutelords are inba, right, even though he has 3-3 marines So I guess the Zerk gets really crap upgrades and the Terran doesn't doesn't and then he loses to brute lords I want to make a small prediction that I just, I have this weird feeling that the transposing of the Zerk is not going to be the issue Or the, I don't like transitioning of the Zerk A lot of the time when people say this, what they mean is not that Zirk was switching between tags but actually that they didn't scout something that the Zerk was doing. And I think in this case it's going to be the Brutelor This is extremely common in IOTIS where people go like, they switch deck so fast, even though Zerk just like they go to Hive in like 15 minutes and then start Brutelord and they never switch out of it This is so, so common and for some reason, especially Terran's believe that this is switching unfairly because Terran is the only race that's fine in building literally Marines until the 35 minute mark These guys they have, you know, they're always confused when the other races don't do those Like, whoa, they can get out of their basic units That sounds broken Okay, we have link scouting around. We have the heliants not doing very much of anything There's no link speed, so these helions actually should be able to, I don't kill a couple of drones Yes I'm loving it This is the game What happened here? He lost the car against slowlings, didn't he? They sent him back home? I actually sent the car back out Nice, 5 HP I'm not quite sure how you managed to get this much damage on a helion against slow links But. the roach the roach already no it he just took the damage now he actually almost lost the car to four slow links five slow links whatever let's have a look at the structures okay two reactors that's not a thing triple barracks he has a third cc already metavac okay okay okay um she's gonna go for helen drop i guess like this this just smells helen drop you know like the you get a fast medevac the problem here is that he doesn't have a tech lab yet because you usually want to swap or you want to build stim a sap on your on your marines right you get a single tech lab you get stim with it and afterwards combat shield you'd like a 60 marine drop so it's getting a reactor on that's a tech lab another tech lab okay so he's getting double tech labs here this is for maybe he's going to go heavy marauder i think he'll swap these two stim and combat shield at the same time then he can get the star port on this reactor but he's making it difficult for himself when it comes to the add-ons these two definitely need to be reactors though also okay e-base going down after five racks i'll forgive you i'll forgive you lethev the zirc still looks really broken i agree with you so far zirc this is looking absolutely insane i mean is just owning you okay I feel like the terran is not doing anything just not clicking buttons it like I feel like his early game at least was somewhat tight but he's getting second factory infernal pre-igniter And a Benchy. And a ghostic, I thought it was a barracks I feel like every time I look at the production tab, I get a new surprise, you know, and it's all crap It's like the wheel of unfortunate You know, d-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding You're now unemployed Woo! And you spin it again Your wife leaves you Spin it again I don't know what else What other bad things could happen to you, but you go figure it out Okay, this is my theory This is a hell of a supply block Because the first three minutes of Lightoff weren't that bad He played an okay game. I think what happened is, is my man Lightoff got called by his girlfriend or boyfriend It's like, hey, my parents aren't home Do you want to come over and Lightov seizing the opportunity goes yeah I do want to come over but he just found the latter game he already played for three minutes so Lightoff screams Johnny come over here you little prick Johnny's his little brother take over and Johnny of course only being six years old never having played a game on Starcraft before loves loves taking over he's like oh finally he trusts me enough to play one of his video games and I get to use his keyboard Because usually Johnny needs to plug in his own keyboard. The one that got sand in with the computer, you know, the crappy one I get sticky for no reason Now, that fight obviously wasn't great, but this Benji is doing some work on the How about we just let the Benji do with Chop, right? That event shoot that he's getting Ooh, I like he's baiting him in the tank fire This was a good move I like this Johnny And from now on he's Johnny as well We know Lytov is not here anymore Lytthof has left the building He's getting stim An armory? The classic armory before the 1-1 even starts He has two tech labs on barracks Yet only is getting stiff no combat shield Second armory Yeah, it's smart. I mean, he does have two factories And right now a single factory unit So you do really want to work on those tank upgrades, obviously with that single tank Ship weapons, no plating Yes And two more starports, and a fusion core And this game doesn't make any sense anymore Congratulations Cloak! Yeah, just add it on Anything else? No? Maybe bunker plating or Medevac speed you could research next I mean, you're getting two extra starports anyways Another barracks added, of course One one starts Finally Finally one starts You know what little Johnny? We'll call him Lathop again This to this. Lathof is the kind of guy that when you go on a road trip with your friends, you know, everyone has to do part of the work there One guy, he takes care of the music He has the aux cable and he has some good playlist, you know, some bangers for the road trip And then another guy, I don't know, he makes like the route and the planning And then my man, Lightov here, is in charge of the snacks And Latov is the type of guy that brings the stupid baby carrots as a snack That's not a snack That's something you feed your grandma when she comes over and she's a little hungry Here's some snacks, Grandma She can't have chips no more. It's old for that But you can eat this carrot Enjoy it Grandma doesn't have to eat This is what Lightov does with his upgrades He just brings things that no one wants The vehicle plating You think the guys in this army were really looking forward to the freaking vehicle plating on the single four that was here or perhaps we should have had the one one done already in the freaking combat he's he has cloak pre-infernal reigniter pre-infernal reigniter he built four halions this entire game three wait where did that extra i swear to god i knew there was there was four no maybe he killed it himself and it doesn't show up at the unit lost or something like that Planetare. He's up a base as well This is the worst thing He's actually mining like a million times more than his opponent He's just not building things He queued up Infinite units on the Tech Lab barracks And then there is a couple of barracks with Marines that just aren't working He built these starboards, which he still hasn't used I just don't think he uses hotkeys for buildings I think Lytoph might not be. aware that you can hotkey buildings and he just clicks them I think he just clicks them but he doesn't know that he built a star port here anymore so this one this was never gonna build anything I can guarantee you that he just doesn't know it's here and you're same with this armory like out of side out of mind you know he's he's gone hit the microphone for you guys I hope you enjoyed that um this is a good siege position honestly it's not bad You know also what wouldn't be bad? If he had combat shields I don't ask for much, but Combat shield is kind of important Yeah, it's just one of those things that I do like. It's nice snipes, by the way, he's been using Look at Do you the energy on these bad boys Doesn't have a hotkey for sniper, I guarantee you as well He doesn't even know snipes and ability When he watches pro games, And people build like 20 ghost and insta-snip like 10 Brutlords He has no clue what just happened He builds ghosts in his own games They hardly do any damage Look at this It takes years to kill a corruptor They have their worse than Marines and I pay gas for them That's ridiculous Freaking two supply for this crap unit? He doesn't understand it at all Still up, by the way Still absolutely blasting his opponent 4K in the bank No problem High roller. My man Lytov over here boom mules no problem over saturation boom no problem oh Jesus this completely empty you know in IOTIS it's often difficult to see what type of job people have in real life but he's definitely not like an efficiency manager like a power plant or something like that Holy crap, he's understaffed at this base How would they even work? He's the kind of guy, my man, my man light off here, that owns a gardening company consisting of seven consultants and zero actual gardeners. And then he looks, he looks at like his, at his year report, it's like, another year with just loss, like, if no, clients and I have so many consultants like when his advertising his marketing budget is insane he's just everyone knows his company but for some reason just the work doesn't get done he just looks at it and he just doesn't understand it light off in a nutshell puts another baby carrot in his mouth idiot oh the distraction this is the play this the play this moving in here a moving this yes yes yes yes the tank run by an iotis classic no combat shield no madevx no problem shoot down the spine crawler whoop lose this entire army kill two is going to get three evos before he lose everything to the brutes this a drum roll i'm not sure if you guys can hear it do did did do do do do do no only gets two evos does manage to take out a couple extra broodling so good job on that very useful fifth base for the Zirk my man Lightov's never gonna scout this base my man Lightov just did his final push didn't this is just two battle cruised wait nice these two villains are never gonna get used man the last time the last time Lightov looked at this base like the last time light was still look at the base there still still is a wall in Germany. This is not it He hasn't seen his natural in years Let's take a look at his fight though It's going to be fantastic It's a single corrupter and there's two battle cruisers Now be careful because you might be thinking these battle cruisers look very weak but, but, but, we can't forget about the vehicle plating upgrade here So these battle cruisers actually can take a lot more damage than you expect These guys can take a beating with their level one vehicle plating Oh, let me tell you that much Now, you could be saying, well, Kevin, why don't you get ship weapons? I mean, battle cruisers attack 50 times a second. Wouldn't an attack upgrade be more impactful in this fight against only Broodlords? Yes, but I mean, how could Johnny or Latov have known that beforehand? There's some good micro, by the way. He just right-clicks the Broodlords. The Battlecruiser is one of those units that can shoot while moving, so you actually should move it rather than right-clicking and just following, you lose a lot of damage output. You saw how much the vehicle plating did in that fight, I think. The Battlecruiser's got maybe half, or maybe two extra shots off. One or two extra shots off on these Corruptors. Almost killing a single Corruptor. Whoop, big blinking. Oh, he's forced now to look at this Battlecruiser's gone. Oh no, he F-2ed. Okay. Yeah, okay, that's his luck That there was in the control group or an F-2 Because God knows he's never looked at this part of the map This base also just isn't gonna mule anymore It's done, you know? This side is just, it's over After he finished his upgrade, does he have 3-3 yet? I think so, right? Yeah, yeah Well, he's really supposed to have 18 minutes in the game After he got 3-3, he did this part of the map He just puts like a checkmark sticker on it On his monitor, it's like, I don't need to look there no more This is done Mission accomplished Does he blink? And no But we still have another battle loser. Maybe we can do something with that Oh, yes Pull the workers away That was very important They definitely were in danger as he moved back Now you look at this situation and you think to yourself, Kevin This game is very over, isn't it? And I say, no, not really This base completely undefended Well, parties two roaches But he still doesn't have combat shield He's never going to He's not aware of combat shield He just is not aware of the combat shield Honestly, if he just What he can do is he can send this battle closer over here I'm pretty sure he's going to kill every single drone here And he can just do. If we look at this situation, the opponent has 19 units 19 19. 19 corruptors here that are made entirely their entire purpose in life is to deal with this one air unit this battle cruiser perhaps this battle cruiser is he going to blame no of course not why do it why do i even try to get my hopes up that battle cruiser here actually would been able to do something I'm just sad it's you look at these games and you think this is potential and three minutes in I already know there's not going to be any potential anymore I just I can see it I can smell it I just just they I don't I don't mind mistakes with the combat shield and the Just everything It's just not very good He hasn't used snaps. Why do you build ghosts? If you don't use snipes Okay, here we go No, this is good No, this is a move Light off is good He's making me happy now He's heard my wines He's heard me complain all the way to some European countries from all Europeans are the same Now, he just forced an entire iron act There's too many roaches at this point, isn't there? He's just gonna lose to Mass Roach He's actually losing to Mass Roach 20 minutes in game. 3-3-Bio against 2-1 roaches and he can't counter it it because he has zero matter facts and yes no combat shield and he doesn't have an army and this is these stupid ghosts are triggering me as well to know but this is it he actually still was outmining his opponent I actually I actually I got something new that I wanted to do but I feel like my vibe has been killed I'll do it anyway A fan sent this to my house This is the imba inspector hat It reads imba And just like your fire inspector checks if there's a fire I check if there's any imbalance in this I have a feeling I already know the answer, but let's just open the claim. We open the claim and we got to have, you know, we got to have an honest look Okay The game was smooth I was up in basis Okay, the game was not smooth You can't say this This is, if you think this is smooth, I want to see you hit on like a girl because that has to be something like, hey Kevin, let me show you these smooth moves You walk over, spill a drink on her, poop yourself, come back to me, he's like, not sure why she denied me, but that was pretty smooth Like, this game was not smooth This was the exact opposite of smooth. You kept the zirka under pressure? No, the only pressure that happened here was my blood pressure rising every time you got a useless upgrade But you didn't deny his hatcheries, hatcher ass What? He killed one base The entire game, no? Suddenly he went to Brutelords This is the type of thing that you can only say if you've never scouted in your life Is like, and suddenly he had 12 Brutlords And I wasn't aware of it Oh, yeah, like, if you don't scout for the entirety of the game, that is kind of what happens Smash my army, my 3-3 Marine without combat shield He forgot to mention the no combat shield did nothing. I went to produce TORs, but I was playing bio and snipers are suck Yeah, because you didn't use any spells on them You produced TORs TORs are good Tor's the only unit that don't really require micro, and they just did their job, even though for some reason they had more plating upgrades than attack upgrades But I can almost forgive you for that So hard to keep it alive, control, Goss Havi, and to transpose into MacB Well, you're not supposed to transpose into Mac, but you could have added some Thor's and some snipers, some, some, some, some, some ghost. Not saying broodlords are imba, well, you were saying that, but the ability for Zirk to transpose into whatever he likes with only one building is so opie You can just build it to Drapme or to go massive Okay, I'm actually done I don't want to read anymore I'm losing IQ every sentence I read This game was extremely sad for me It's just, I look at this and I think what has become of my platinum league, where I started out as well You know, I think back of the times, this is like when you go back to your old neighborhood and the playground is now a factory This is what it feels like You've ruined my old neighborhood The nostalgia is gone. This is what platinum is like Please don't go too hard on me Thanks It's too late This, yeah, I don't know This made me really, really sad I can take off my hat My work here is done You suck And you suck extremely hard Don't ever send me a replay again Never That's it I'm out Smash like."

        "text": "Hiya, Harstam With this I want to show you a prime example of why Terran is completely and utterly broken To all the things of your little reservoir you throw at them, they always have a great counterplay to stonk you while also having the best units in the game to harass you, scout you and also of course out DPS you with their bio Hope you can agree with me on this one Thanks Lebrequeza. Lebrakezae is a master Protos player from Europe as we hop straight into the game playing against T a terran player from well also Europe somewhere in Europe I assume oh this is when we start with something like this this tickles me in the right way you know I just see this gateway second second core well the first core can be built over here you have a nice little Reaper well this is the type of stuff that makes me very very happy when I see this I just look at it and go like yeah this is start This is how I know it. Um, T on the other hand, just playing some barracks for shenanigans, but this, oh my God, just core over here, gateway close to the ramp already rally to the correct location He's rallying into gas Oh my God, I look at it and I just, I just, I just want to pass the game I say, I take off the hat I say, yeah, Theron, Taron is broken End of the episode Hope to see you guys No We can't do that here. we can't do that here but i do want to do it when i see just ah ah this is so beautiful oh two probes mining in gas 16 on minerals a pylon oh i only was floating 10 minerals this is this is this is like when you you wake up and there's there's fresh fresh buns in the oven you know you smell it oh can't wait to eat them all right What do we have here? Just, it looks pretty soon He's rallying the probes Yes Okay, I'm very happy This makes me, this is good to see. You know, this is the beauty of watching people that are masters or grandmasters, and they just have a build order, and the things they do make sense He chrono boost his gateway, and his core is spinning with the warp gate Everyone is happy and dancing His opponent is supply block, and is opening marauder first I'm not sure if he scouted that it was, yeah, wait, he lost his worker So he knows his marine first, and because he sees its marine first, he sends out the adept If he sees that it's reaper first, he doesn't send out the adept This is just, this is perfect This is exactly how you want to be doing He's even rallying the stalker already. He's crono boosting it, gets a third stalker, twilight coming down Now, what you do is you use your adept shade to see what's kicking off Pompidon he sees a marauder and a attack lab and he's like okay I'm afraid of concussive shot I'm going to go back home and now he needs to build a gateway and a better I never thought I'd see the day where we'd have a freaking protos player just doing exactly what I tell everyone to do this guy just watches my videos He knows, he has reactions and everything I wouldn't mind one extra chrono on these probes, but if he used it on the blink later on, I can kind of live with it as well. Ah, okay, one more on the probe, buddy We do need one more chrono on the probe Okay, it's a minor error I like to have a little more eco than this guy has, you know? It's just slightly better to have like one extra probe It's just nice, but it's okay It's okay Taryn Scouts, what does he see? Two stalkers, he's back, okay, never mind, I'm back Going back home Sentry? Did he warp that in? I think he might have warped that in Double gas, okay So, usually I'd say the most common thing to do is to get a fast nexus if you play Sentry as well It's not too common to play four gas, but I don't mind it. This is not necessarily Batman This is This is a beautiful game I'm so happy with this He's playing an actual build order He's going to get an observer Wait, does he want a corona boost? I don't think he wants to chrono boost it And he definitely doesn't want to send it across the map So the whole point of this thing is, is that you don't need to send your observer across the map because you can freaking hallucination scout Second observer? Oh no, what are you doing? What are you doing with my build? This is not good Okay, what he's supposed to do here is he's supposed to get, like four stalkers or so, because he has such a fast blink. You don't actually need that many You can just position him properly Then he can get a very fast robo bay That's the entire point of this build The reason why you don't get a third base with charge? For a gateway, forge? All right, you guys know Bob Ross, right? So for the people that don't know Bob Ross, Bob Ross was this geezer who, he basically, he'd have a painting, okay? And he'd tell you how to paint it, stroke by stroke So you say, you use this color and then you do pop, pop, like this. And then everyone gets a pretty similar painting, but it's still kind of your own painting as well in some type of way, you know? So this is kind of like my man, Leibra Keza, has been following a Bob Ross painting for the first five minutes, four minutes and 30 seconds You know, and really this painting only takes five minutes And just as my man Bob is about to say, all right, now we take out the green and do some final stroke, some nice little happy trees over here Labrakeza just pulls down his pants and starts peeing on the canvas Why would you do that, Labrakeza? You were almost done All you had to do was get this freaking Robo Bay. like 45 seconds ago Now this build makes no sense Like you're rushing out Colossi, 4 gas, delaying economy, and then you're not rushing out Colossi What is this? Stop peeing on the canvas What's wrong with you? Bob doesn't deserve this Charged and an immortal? He's been dropped on the head one too many times Like you can only improvise if you know what you're doing Now the main problem that I have with is it is just that it doesn't make any sense whatsoever Because if you get an immortal here, well actually the immortal in this case does make some sense because your robot is laid for no reason. Now this is so bad because ideally you have two colossi out before the first push hit So regular push timing hits at 6 30, 635 That's with two metaphics If your opponent pushes you without Metafx, they can hit maybe at six minutes or so In that case you will still have one Colossi because you're supposed to get your freaking Robo Bay about 35 to 40 seconds earlier than our man did over here and with a couple of decent Chrono boost like he would have already had a Colossi out Second Colossi should be about halfway done so basically where now the first Colossus is should be the second Colossus. Termal Lent starting just now the plus one can just be delayed for this by the way It's not necessary to be this fast but also the four gates and just go the three It's all you really need What the hell are these stalkers doing? They're going on an adventure They're definitely going on an adventure They have no clue where they're going They just stepped on the boat and then boom, out of here These rocks get taken down I mean, this is not an army So observer is okayish place, but our man has no vision Anywhere else, like, he has some vision here, but he doesn't know if the army is going to come from here It's going to come from here. He just saw some units here, so he could just position himself kind of in the middle But he's going to need very quick responses Okay, so he gets scanned And he's like, okay, he probably just scans here Well, obviously he's going to go here It gets right clicked on the Nexus This guy's just going to right click a next and run away, I guess Yeah This makes a lot of sense Who would have thought that if you have no vision, have no clue where your opponent's army is coming from? Then he scans for it This is the most obvious move by this by the way Terrans always want to scan for it before they go somewhere. So they go like, ah, let me just scan this real fast and then Boom, they're running. Hello? You just lost four or five Stalkers for free, my man. You can't attack anymore. No rebuild on the third base. What? Okay I'm just so confused. So he loses his fourth base or third base. Now he can make two decisions. Either he rebuilds his third base and starts playing for a longer game. Or what he does is he adds Gateways and goes for a quick push. In that case, you probably want a Warp Prism and the extra Gates make a lot of sense. What our man does over here is he starts his 2-1 and investment in the future and gets four extra gates before he gets his third base And then he still gets his third So he's going to have bad eco, but he's playing for a longer game, but also extra gateways and not producing any workers You know how sometimes people say, like, you want to have your cake and eat it too? He wants the opposite He doesn't want to eat the cake, and he doesn't want it He just has this want and tries like some Harry Potter spells on the cake, trying to make it disappear He's doing one hell of a job I have no clue what he's doing. He's scouts like, ah, there's a third base Oh, I don't have that That's annoying I honestly have absolutely zero idea what our man is doing over here, and it's pissing me off Well, I had no vision on the bottom side Who could have thought that there might be drops? When I play against the race, that's primary unit is a drop ship that can heal He's down 68 supply The other guy just Actual macro Oh, I walked away from my third base I hope it doesn't die again Does this guy not have object permanence? Like the moment something moves out of vision, it doesn't exist anymore He's literally dumber than a magpie Macpies have object permanent So do dogs and cats cats. Our man, Labra case is like a terrible bird It's like a duck or something like that Can't really fly I doubt honestly Oh, they just shot I bet nothing going on And people can say, well, he doesn't have an observer He doesn't have a robot to build observers What is this? What is this? He has forges He can build a cannon No Just lets it go Rebuilds his, his battery rather than just sending the, or it's a robotics facility, rather than just sending the observer back Like, what is actually happening here? I don't understand I just don't understand this at all Yeah, well, who would have thought? They keep shooting if you don't deny them Honestly, this Terran is playing a fantastic game. His unit movement has been A-plus I'm not disappointed with this at all, honestly I'm pleased with how this Terran is playing I'm not pleased with how the pros are playing Dang, freaking mines impossible to beat Okay, our men invested 1,100 gas into sentries Guardian shield, guardian shield, double guardian shield You can use seven more, my friend Use a couple extra guards Two force fields 1100 gas Two force fields and a double guardian shield No? No more? This is it? If he walks into these mines, there's He recalls This mine has eight kills It's done seven shots and has been in the natural of the toss How is this even possible? This guy is literally dumber than a This guy is a duck. An actual duck And this Terran isn't feeding him any bread There's no clue how to survive in winter The pond is freezing Ducks are dumb animals Should have been a squirrel made Hide some food for the winter Squirrels have object permanence as well How else are they going to find their food later on? They can't Did you know that dogs can actually still remember that something is there after placing two cups on top of it and rotating it 90 degrees? That's how good dogs are Labyrincaise is not a dog He's a duck I like that he doesn't really feel like he needs to hurry either His opponent is on three base, taking a four. He's like, ah, maybe I can kite off one or two marines over the next minute and a half Let me just take out this refinery to deny my opponent's gas mining Meanwhile Meanwhile he literally has three probes mining He uses force fields That has been a good investment He forgets to GG He actually forgets to GG This. How can you not GG after a game like this? You pee on the canvas, you destroy my build order, and then you complain that the other guy's unit to my 2,000, units do too much hours like you had zero map vision the entire game these minds are still here they don't understand how how this is possible honestly how can you how can you think this is imbalanced when you play like this you're not allowed to speak about balance anymore my friend is it inbar do I suck well that's an easy answer you suck and you suck extremely hard all right That's going to be it for today if you enjoyed this episode.

        "text": "Hello, Captain I am here to tell you what I saw What I encountered in a late evening I was just playing StarCraft as usual, but one game I encountered a cyclone Not one, not three, but there were many of them The first one was handled poorly, but I managed to get back, and later I had the micro like a big boy, but I couldn't They just lock on and run A seaman apprentice could microdom I used all my tactics, but I couldn't win So Captain, is it Imba? Or do I suck? Good question Bush? Nice. I always knew a lot of famous people were watching me, but that the ex-president of the United States of America was a big fan of the show, I would have never thought We have my man, Busher, was a master's player I believe this was in Europe I could be wrong Hamster will correct me 4,500 MMR, though, which is beautiful, playing against a 10 Taryn Barco, he opens up with gas first Now, we'll see about these responses from Bush to this gas first build Now, the gas first build is different in the barracks first, in that it gives you faster gas But it also gives you a slightly later reaper Your barracks is delayed by a couple of seconds. This allows you to always send your first adept across the map, especially in combination with hiding probes, forcing the Reaper to stay back to defend his base Usually you get a cancel on the base, or not a cancel but you'll get an SCV now at least His opponent's actually playing two gas Now our man Bush here sees that And Bush is a big fan of natural resources So he definitely wants to go and deliver some freedom to this Terran right now We believe they have weapons of mass destruction And they also have two refineries And I want those That's my Boche accent It's not bad Alright, my man Bush here What are you doing? Sacrifice himself for the Marine. You think, you say, I could make fun of this He could have saved this probe But the idea of checking whether it's a Marine or a Reaper is the correct plan So I'm not going to make fun of him for that I think that was a brave thing to do Good job to you And probes are replaceable So it's fine Actually the information is more important than the 50 workers If he was quick, he also could have seen it was a tech lab I doubt he clicked it He probably expects a reactor I'd expect a reactor here And the correct response to this probably is actually Stargate into Phoenix. If you, if you, if this is all you scout, I would say play Stargate and go into Phoenix, two gate, battery and every base, that type of stuff Then you scout with the first Phoenix exactly what's going on But it's also possible to play Robo 2 or Robo 3gate, which is what Bush here is doing And I don't even mind it I like the decisions that he's taking so far I don't like that he wasn't a moving this Now, what Bush should be doing is sending this adept forward He should scout what's happening He should cancel and move home This is not what he's supposed to He's going to lose this adept for free Well, for free Yeah, for free actually. I thought he was going to get that SEV, but he didn't His opponent is floating the barracks across the map This is going to be there to provide, help provide vision for his cyclone Who has the super rockets? Now, at this point, Bush knows most most likely that it's the super rockets It still could have been drilling claws upgrade, but he saw the first cyclone So most commonly this is going to be indeed a cyclone Now he only has one extra unit and he's going to lose that So it's a little bit painful This is really just because he lost that first at that depth It's a good attempt at surrounding and this is just a bit of an unfortunate situation. I could make fun of him again here saying well you should have your stalker better or two second faster battery but I mean, this is just really because he lost that adapt early on Right now he's fine again Now he needs to make some decisions though Because if we think about what lock on does as an ability on the cyclone is that it locks on and then it has a lease range which is larger than the range of almost every unit that ProDos has How could we break that lock on possibly? Couple of options We could get a Prism Prism can pick up the stalker for the sentry that is being locked on and that will cancel the lock on ability. Another thing we could do is we could get blink and blink back any stalkers that are getting locked on Another thing we could do is rush to Colossus and get thermal lands Thermal lands out ranges, not the lock-on and least range, but the, well, not the least range, but the initial lock-on range, meaning you get a lot of free damage in before your opponent ever gets there Another thing you can do is get sentries, and when they try to get into range to lock on, it should put down a force field And of course, micro-units back in general is a wise decision Microwing forward when you're trying to kill cyclones also is a wise decision We see him going straight for Robo Bay. I think this is the worst option, and I think if you're going straight for Robo Bay, you still should be opening up with a prism as well against this My man Bush here is not doing that instead He's going to go for an immortal, which sounds good Like, Immortal does a lot of damage against armored units Not actually the correct call you're going to need that prism to rather than trying to push out as much damage as possible, you're going to need to deny as much damage as possible with a prism and some pickup micro Now, please do note that we have full information of exactly what's going on We see mines being produced here at the same time as well. Mines, armory, well, this is Mac, and at this point, we should understand, as Proto's players, that two things. A, it's going to be Helian or Cyclone Widow Mine Mac, meaning that stalker colossi with thermal lens is going to be an extremely powerful option and we should not skip out on observers here because otherwise you can't see the mines obviously now it's important that you don't get locked on blindly every single time this is not bad honestly like this this micro it could have been a bit better but it's it's not it's not terrible the thing that you should never do is you should never get locked on with one while running away which is exit this is good you know it's sad because I think Bush is not a bad player okay he's a man with the right intentions he just wants some natural resources but instead he's not gonna get those because he he doesn't quite know what to do he just is unaware of what to do in this situation does that mean that cyclones are imbalanced I don't know but he he's not playing a bad game you know he's building workers, he's building upgrades, he does what he thinks he should be doing. He just, the problem is really that he isn't really thinking about what he should be doing, he's just going through the motions, you know? This is this kind of a strategy game after all, where sometimes thinking is necessary and losing all your units to five cyclones isn't quite it No thermal lens either yet, no observers here, so this is a classic move, by the way, where the mines, they're gonna zone out the extra units from saving your base or or not instead he's just going to sacrifice this to Colossi to the Cyclone gods It's some solid moves here coming out of bush I have to admit Some solid moves coming out of bush. Plus one attack, blink starting as well, a couple extra gateways Now all of this is nice and fun. How is this your response to not being able to see? not being able to see things like you know that probably a couple of cannons in the face of seven cyclones is the way to go super batteries putting in some work though he just keeps pulling back into the super battery we might actually be able to get a trade here if only had an observer whoop he's just getting absolutely blasted by this guy holy crap dridden claws is done as well yeah he just has he just doesn't have the tools to deal with his blink still now I love how he tanks the mine shots. It's like because maybe then afterwards I can kill them not realizing they're just going to go invisible every single time Oh, bush, oh bush, oh bush And another one bites it This was a very, very ambitious warping right there I love it I'm such a fan of what Bush is doing here He can see everything though He's had an observer in there for a long time Problem is he doesn't really have an observer to clear anything At this point, Bush is just that and the best thing for him to do is not only to stop wasting his own time, but to stop wasting our collective time Okay I have a suspicion that Bush here is being serious. And that he thinks that the way to beat this is to go for a probes around. Listen to this. What he does is he stacks them all up together. He clicks on the minerals here, so he does a mineral walk through these units, and then he surrounds the cyclones. Let's see how that pans out of the next 10 seconds. Oh, there we go. Mineral walk, no, just an A move. Five probes made it. Just lost two stalkers on the way, and blink forward. You see, I wanted to end the game earlier because I was like, this game looks pretty over. What else is here to get? But apparently this man researches Blink and his opponent has two different units, two different units that have a lock-on ability that can be dodged with Blink How does Bush uses Blink? Let I just want to show this this just to make sure you guys are aware of what he did here He clings forward How is this even possible? One thing Bush was right about, though, they did have weapons of mass destruction These mines have been 13 freaking kills on this Mnine Holy crap There's some big damage right there, dude Some big damage, I mean, this is it Gigi They just lock on and run A seaman apprentice could micro them. I used all my tactics, but I couldn't win My man Bush has the smallest book of strategies and tactics in the world Just that's one thing Make robo, build colossi, win the game That's it That's the entirety of his strategical knowledge Once it gets passed, standard bio has no clue what to do He does not do mechanical warfare, my friends He does not do mechanical warfare Bush, cyclones, widow mines, they're annoying to deal with and they're okay But are they broken? Are they imba? No You just suck I don't have my imba inspector head, but it's okay You suck really, really hard. And that's going to be it for this episode of Is It Inba or Do It Suck?

        "text": "Hi Kevin I may have to ask you for your help this time For a long time, I truly believe that I can offset any imbalance in the game with hard work and more game knowledge, but I came to the conclusion after the following game that this isn't the case I played a fairly decent game versus this Prodos player who rushed out Storm, which obliterated all of my early attacks Then he went for Void Race This perfect combination of units cannot be countered by any Zirk unit The storm deals with all the light units from banlings to hydras, and the voyage stared through the thick armor of every armored unit, be it roach or an ultralisk. The only good Zirk air unit, the Corruptor, is armored as well Zirk has no answer to this combo Please investigate this unfairness and tell me if this could have been solved in any way that is humanly possible Thanks in advance, Golgo Tai Golgothai is a diamond Zirk player on the EU ladder with 3,225 MMR And he asked, is it Inba or do I suck? And we're here for you to investigate All right, Mr Nudest Gulgatai Let's have a look to see what you're doing You claim that rushing into storm and attacking into void rays is completely unbeatable I don't think it is But I have an open mind to things, you see, just like you, you're a nudist. You know what it's like to have an open mind to things You've got to try new things sometimes So I'm going to try to entertain this claim that Voidre Storm is unbeatable, even though both of them have pretty terrible range And they don't have any real counter to Lurker, for example, because you can't outrange the Lurker things like Lurker Hydra, or Lurker Hydra Vyper can be very difficult to deal with if you're playing Storm pure void right now You can add in carriers to counteract it or add in Tempest But just pure Storm Templar So we're pretty much expecting. I was expecting either a Twilight Council opener here, as it said Rush Storm, or I was going to be expecting maybe even a Stargate opener, opening up with a couple of Void Race to then straight go into Storm but it seems to me that this is instead a fast robotics facility Now, nudist Gulgatai meanwhile is She's doing a pretty standard build, except he forgot his third base Maybe Okay, he's going to get it now It's a little bit late No third queen yet either It's probably going to get supply block here as well It's not the greatest start for our protagonist But, you know, I can deal with it He scouts everything Usually if you see the robo, you know enough. I wouldn't recommend going any further with the scouting, but it seems to work out as his opponent isn't really getting a stalker as a follow-up You see two overlords on the way, of course, because he got the 36 out of 36 supply block, a true classic supply block of the ages It's a road warren This is a fair assessment of the situation, honestly He saw two extra gates being added He sees four gates He sees a robo My mind goes to things like an immortal win That's actually the only thing Maybe a gateway, pure gateway army on it So Roche Warren is definitely a correct call. Now, do we want to get a second guess with that? Maybe you want to get a second guess with that eventually I wouldn't completely mind it His work account is extremely low He's just not injecting properly he's, his build order makes very, very little sense He's floating 800, he's slowing 900 minerals at the 4 minute mark That is not good at all That is not good at all Slight oversaturation in the natural here So he has a lot of larvae actually He's 11 larva just not using it It's, oh, another supply So it went from 36-36 into 49 out of 50 It's going to start floating up to 1,200 minerals at this point, pre-5-minute mark. This is, honestly, even for diamond, this is a very, very high float This is going to be lower diamond, though, at 3,300 It's going to be Diamond 3 on Europe So it is not the top of diamond Big difference there, of course, between the bottom and the top of diamond Forged Twilight So now we're going to see the famous storm rush coming out of late van There is some type of scouting going on here from Golgothai It's going to be able to take out this probe at least but his own build order still doesn't make a lot of sense He sees the third go down He has no follow-up scouting information is going to go into layer. Still slight oversaturation in the natural, but his drone count is starting to look healthier His injects have picked up, and his spending of larva has picked up Double Evo, double gas I don't know about the double ego The double gas, all right, we can live with if he spends his larvae now, gets a couple more drones Maybe it's okay Double Evo, I'm not a fan of He's not aware if this is a real third base, if this is a fake third base, what is happening behind this The double Evo seems unnecessarily risky He also simply just doesn't have the gas to really use both Evo chambers You can see he can't even afford road speed and a plus one upgrade here. So, yeah, that second Evo is kind of useless Just going to be wasting some money away in that Could be spent perhaps on drones into another hatchery He's going to get another hatchery He realizes his shortcomings Now, you can say, well, I never see pro players get a hatchery in their main base That's true Pro players also have better mechanics If you're struggling with getting enough larva out, there's nothing wrong with getting an extra macro hatch I think this is a smart call This is a mature call This is saying, okay, I understand that my mechanics aren't as good as the top talks I need more larva I'm not going to hit all of my inject I get an extra hatchery. I very often say this as well to Protos players or Terran players like, hey, increase your infrastructure, and they'll tell me well, but I need my, my, I see, I see, Arsham only gets eight gateways on three ways Yes, but Harstam plays this game eight hours a day He dreams about it You play three games a week and two of the games are warmer Like, just add three gateways No one cares It's just good practice If, if you don't need it anymore, cut it out But if you're constantly floating 1,200 minerals, yeah, This is a good call and I'm not going to make fun of him for that There's plenty of other things in his play that we can make fun. For example, the 17 supply block in a row, but these are all mechanical errors So far, do we have any major strategical errors, except for the weird double evo that hasn't been used yet? The weird gas mineral distribution and the lack of drones Too many units No real scouting from our, from our dude I mean, he really hasn't seen much of anything He's not aware that there's a Templar archives He's not aware of really anything He's once again floating 1,300 minerals Work account is looking pretty okay And his main claim was that Storm Voidre was perhaps a little bit too good Storm is out. If we count well, we see two Templar, which means there's going to be a maximum of four storms in his army for now I actually think that Golgatai, if he would spend his money, but even without spending his money, It's going to have a really nice timing here if he hits with bainlings speed Imagine just morphing 10, 15 vanlings here and just rolling in This army has no real tanking power except with the immortals, but those are tanks in the back Zellis are going to die against the bainlings, then you have Roach Ling left to deal with a bunch of immortals I think this is an army that can take this all very, very easily. Now, we do have a Stargate on the way here for a late van as well So it's a massive supply, by the way Holy crap, this painful I wouldn't mind seeing a couple of extra drones and any type of scouting really, whether that's just sending in an overs here or just making sure there's no fort base over here or for it's over here, instead Golgatai is going to scout through the oldest way possible and that is by attacking It's like, hey, what is my neighbor doing? Let me just beat his brains in It's always a good strategy You should try it sometimes as well. increases the interaction you have with your neighbor and perhaps with your your local authorities as well a couple of storms go down not the worst micro so far by either player actually the tosses micro in pretty well this is a classic look at that assimilator getting a beating of a lifetime oh yes oh look at these guys they're doing some real work and man this Nexus sure is getting it these roaches This is when you, what happens when you have two groups of drunk people fighting in the street And then there's, you have like five against five and you're losing the fight and you're wondering what happened And then you see John on the side just beating up this lamp post. Yeah, take it Take it you thin prick That's what those roaches were doing, really going ham on that assimilator I mean, they managed to take it down real good as well, but I'm not quite sure if that was the optimal use of the resources that were available at the front here Single Ling is going to kill his seventh probe Still, good fight 2200 minerals Lots of material here for a remix, lots of resources here for a remix and another push I mean, the storm didn't look too powerful, honestly If you ask me, the storm didn't do too much Really? Another round of bainlings I think the strategy behind this is not bad We're just lacking a little bit in mechanics. It's like, hey, there's 2K in the bank, you know, that's a crap ton of links That's what? 2,000, that is, 40 sets of links There's 80 links 80 links could be out It's 40 supply We're missing in this army That's a lot of army we're missing That's really a lot of army we're missing And it's not like our Tos really has a great army I mean, he has two argons now for tanking That's it Once these arcons are gone, there's not even a storm available at this point Straight remax into a fight probably would have been an okay call, but I also don't mind going into higher tech at this point. So we go up to 84, 85 workers, get those eight gases saturated You see the gas count is a little bit low, tends to be a little bit low No queen on this hatchery makes me a little bit sad I wouldn't have minded a queen there to throw a couple of injects that way You see some injects are being used One, two, active injects Yeah, could be worse, could be better Well, could be a lot better And our friend Golgletai decides, you know what, maybe it's time to go again I've given my opponents enough time to rebuild right now I'm still floating 2 5K, so I don't think I'm ever going to spend that money Let's just go again. And I can't blame the guy, honestly I mean, he's a good position He's maybe he's going to wait for 2-2 It is possible I don't mind if he doesn't He can go straight into Hive, by the way A nice play here would be very often when ProDol's is stuck on three bases, they can get good armies so they get these Arkon immortal Templar armies And Sirk is like, well, this sucks, you know, I keep denying the fourth base and then Toss still gets a good army off of six gas That's true But what Tos can do off of six gas is get a good army and get tempest or get carriers as well. So if you just go into Brutelords from a Ravager-Ling-Bain army that you initially have into Brut-Lordes, the Brut-Lord push is almost always going to win you the game if you do good damage when you, with your first or your second push which is a quick tip, something you can do Instead, we're going to see neural parasite being researched This is high-level stuff A couple of spines going down I wouldn't mind a higher drone count here We're only at 71 That is a little bit low I wouldn't mind 84, 85 those higher drone counts I'm not sure what Golgatai is waiting for Maybe it's a sign from God He's like, dang it Still nothing Oh, he's microing the mutalis Oh, there we go. John once again, really hitting that lamppost hard Keep going buddy Meanwhile he goes in with the big army Storm kills a lot of these bains actually That was kind of poor micro It's going to end up killing every single probe at the third base, but this fight probably should have been a clean victory He just straight rolled through the storms I think he probably had to try to clump those bainings harder Like that was a lot of area of effect You know if you ever try the unit test map, and you clump 25 void race on top of each other and you cast fungles in it until they explode and you left, go to bed and you have nice dreams. I sometimes do that It felt like Golgatai was doing the same thing here He still has a lot of money, by the way He is still really far ahead Worker-wise, his opponent's army, even though relatively large, is crap So if he can just rebuild a good army with the money that he currently has, I don't think he's going to be in a bad pot still, though I would like a higher worker count I would like to see Hive is done, that's nice, maybe a greater spire here or a second spire Hell, I wouldn't even mind seeing him transition into Lurker at this point Now, this is going to be a controversial topic. But really, there's only two major ways you can transition out of Reverger-Lingbane Way one is to go into Brutlords and from there go into Brutlord in Fester, Corruptor, Viber That is your first composition to be entering the late game Your second composition, that is a possibility, is by going, I guess, a roachling bane is a bit so-so, but you can do it He already has the range of grace He can go roach-ling bane into hydra, into lurker And then lurker-ling bane, you're going to go corruptor viper with that as well You use the lurkers to control ground areas while basically flying around with corruptor viper armies looking for damage What Golgatai is doing is something else. After his last test, which he managed to squeeze 40 Banelings on top of each other to catch a single Storm a blast for that, by the way. Might once get a Nobel Prize for science for that as physics or whatever. He really had to count the molecules for that, my friends. Optimize that very much so. Now, he decided that he wants a second attempt here. As the first time went so well, trades so far, you see, have been extremely cost efficient for him as well, trading at a one to two ratio. Every two units that he loses, or every hundred resources that he losses, his opponent only loses 50. So he's like, you know what? I kind of want to keep going this way because it's been going great Here we go. Opponent is moving towards a late-game army that is not only massive, but also highly-sufficient, sophisticated and our friend here still has an army that consists of tier one units literally only tier one units all of these units can be made on the first tier of zirk while there's storm arcon immortal void ray good clump here on the banings who that was a nice one not as good as the last one i think two storms were required to kill all of these but if we take a look at the unit's loss step this once again was an absolutely terrible fight so Golgatai really continuing what he was doing before and enriching us with awful fights that we can look at you know how sometimes you have these these signs that have very basic instructions on what they'll be in the train you know or like how to enter the train you know like not with your like watching your phone or with your eyes closed or walking him backwards you know is a big red cross through it. That's kind of what Golgatai is doing here He's providing us with valuable resources that we can hang on the subway stations Like this is not what you do when you engage a Protos army or just when you engage in general against any kind of splash Golgatai is showing us all the way not to go about it He's really just giving us a manual of mistakes It's crazy He's insane crease red by the way He's 120 27 creep tumors This is the guy that probably has the creep tumor spread on rapid fire, but doesn't manage to get below 2,000 minerals in like a 15 minute game Right now he's. Wait, he went ultras? fact that there's not a single anti-air unit here in an army that's going to be fighting 10 void race Not only that, I just need to pause before he throws away this army for free He also actually just has units that are getting hard counted You could say it's fine that he's not getting any anti-air as long as he's going to absolutely blast the ground You know, you sometimes see that. He's fighting against a guy that has four immortals and like eight arcons, disruptors in the army is like this is an army that fights well against ultras honestly I don't want to waste any more time talking about how bad this army is I just I just kind of want to watch and enjoy you have oh oh nicely walks into the disruptor shot perfect now he yeah I think two bay links might have connected out of the 50 there two arcons go down Disruptor fell? Maybe an immortal? Yeah, one immortal as well Units lost? Oh, he outdid himself with this one I think he lost 10k resources and his opponent lost two and a half That is a four to one trade. That is difficult even if you're trying, which at this point, we just gotta believe that Golgatoy actually is trying to lose his units as fast as possible Maybe this is his challenge He's like, I want to be able to have four to one trades like units lost in total and still be able to win the game Then I'll upload it to YouTube See in this Harstam Kid do pretty well, this beating Grandmaster with stupid stuff series 167 creep tumors This guy's absolutely on crack when it comes to spreading creep But he hasn't had the time yet to open up the Blizzard help menu to figure out that Ultras can't kill void race 14 corruptors I love this. This is the the non what you call it, the non-prepared corruptors which is like crap The ultras didn't kill the void race Now let me try another unit that is armored and I have only a single upgrade for it so far No support whatsoever, no viper, no investor Oh, he got his neural, didn't he? He did get, yes He has pathogen glands and neural He can just get investors against this as well You can just grab the Archons and the Archons kill the rest of the army But you could also get link Bain, more Bain links That has been the issue in the past few fights. So if I look at this game, in my mind, the issue in these past few fights might have been that my man here didn't really have anything to deal with the Archons, didn't micro any of his units, didn't have anything to deal with the immortals and had nothing to deal with the Void Race Really he had nothing to deal with the army, and in the units he did have, he didn't micro And so far, every single fight with Bainlings was either a 1-2 or a 1-4 ratio fight What he decides is he needs unupgraded corruptors against the hard counter of the corruptor, as long as the corruptor is unsupported. The moment the corruptor has support of either parasitic bomb or investors, they're fantastic to fight against Voidres Parasitic bombs against a unit that auto-clumps, Yeah, that's going to be great Fungle against the United Auto Club's Yeah, that's going to be a neural to turn around with the Archons The only meat shield in this army Yeah, that would be great But now, instead, we get, what, 16, 17 plus 29 If I could do math, I would know what it is It's about 46, I believe He gets freaking 46 banlings again. And we're going to be counting connections here, okay? how many bains do manage to connect with this army i think it's going to be slightly more than before because we actually do have a fight on crepe potentially all right here we go here we go banlings all nicely clumped up couple of storms not really going to hit too much all the bains die void rays use their prismatic alignment and all the corruptors go down against the pure Archon void ray army Alright, I actually have a pretty hot take here I think neither the void rays, or the archons were necessary in this army. I think if Leithven just would have, instead of having four Templar and ten void rays, had four more arcons and ten more zealads, he also would have blasted that fight I don't actually think, The issue was with any of the units It was just with the fact that these units can tank too many banlings I bet watching Golgatai play against Mac is something else as well I can't freaking beat barracks This guy just had a barracks wall and I kept sending my banlings into it and I killed so many barracks walls Like he actually would just die against the guy that makes eBay walls for a living, you know? He'd actually just lose the game because he keeps sending him bainlings. Like that's not what you're supposed to do Like there are different ways to kill things It's like for the man, for the man with a hammer, uh, every problem looks like a nail And for the man with a bailing nest, every problem looks bustable Like, holy crap Like this guy, this is not normal You have an addiction, my friend, to the bailing hotkeep And that's an issue because the banings are really expensive and they're so easy to make us they're so easy to make as well You don't even need supply for it. You can just hold down that e-button baining baining baining baining baining baining now i have a feeling you're going to waste our time and stay in the game even though you're down 150 supply So uh let's speed this up a bit Oh, things are happening Look at that We have my man Leithven moving forward with his army As you decided it was wise to go for the mutalisk, hydralisk, Beinling-Ling composition This is the first time you actually managed to do a counterattack as well To be fair, it's the first time Leithven decided to move out I like that you're still staying in You know, it shows up some true grid 160 supply of units. Before you didn't manage to kill 10 supply with more than 100 army supply, and right now you have half of your opponent's army supply, and you're fighting against a guy with a 2K2K bank, and now you're still in You have a lot of fighting power I have to have some real grid is in you I can see a bright future for you Now, the problem, of course, is that you have, 8 mutas and 19 hydras against someone who has 10 carriers and 13 Void Race I doubt you're going to have too great a time against these cannons Oh, a recall happened I feel like at this point you're just kind of wasting everyone's time, including mine, which is fine. I think napping on the job is one of the many advantages of being a content creator Oh, here come the Void Race, and there go your final eight Hydras your final five hydras where's the rest? I doubt you even over the rest is this single carrier What are your upgrades on the hydras? Pretty good, I bet Oh, there's no carapace upgrade It's pretty important to get carapace as well Yeah, this is just a little bit painful, honestly It's just a little bit painful A hatchery goes down Your creeps bread that you worked so hard on Your work of art Sadly, you can take that to the next game. And neither can you take the MMR points that you're about to lose to the next game. as you are my friend definitely about to die G G G is the wrong guy that calls the G G G is the wrong guy that calls the G G G it's the wrong guy that calls the G G G you're still going to say you're going to make him kill I just did my final laugh my friend it's over you have to go I'm just gonna speed it up I don't need to wait for this I have my own rules there we go was defeated alright yeah it was you who sent in the replay nice okay let me take that email this was a good game though you made me laugh you made me laugh the early afternoon it's always good you thought that hard work and more game knowledge like you have less game knowledge than the game manual and these things still think that you start with six workers, like my friend. Don't even try Game knowledge? Your counter to Masvoidre in Mortal Arkham was the Move Command, 48 banlings and 12 ultras into a cannon battery position How can you even speak of game knowledge? I don't understand that I don't understand that. imagine someone coming to you with advice like they need some help with something and you're like hey have you ever have you ever painted a wall or something you know how to do it you're gonna have i have a lot of knowledge so what you do is you just you spit a bit in the in the paint and then you use paper you dip that in the paint and you paste the paper on the wall and then the paint stays on and the guy just looks at you like i don't know a lot about painting but that is definitely not how you paint, my friend You have no game knowledge Actually none Negative. If someone asks you for advice on this game and they listen, they'll be worse than before they ask the advice, which is difficult because almost all advice is good, except whatever is going to come out of your mouth Okay After following game, this is in the case I played fairly decent game versus this Protos player This is fairly decent Jesus The bars Hello Rushed out Storm Abliterated all of my early attacks No, he didn't obliterate your attacks You destroyed him You were up like 50 supply while floating 2 5K I forgot about your macro Your macro wasn't good Look, like I said, you have two possible transitions. You can either go into Brutlord after you do those attack, or you can just go into Lurker Hydra and then go into Corruptor Viper And that's how you deal with it You just need spellcaster You didn't have a single spellcaster Just kept move commanding baylings onto a single spot The storms deal with all the light units from banlings to hydras Yes, because you're stacking them The void stared through the thick armor of every armored unit, be it roach or an ultralisk The only good Zerk air unit, the corruptor is armored as well, yeah, it's useless Zirk has no answer to this combo No, you had no answer to this combo Zirk has perfect answers to this combo. It was you who didn't have an answer Please investigate this in fairness and tell me if this could have been solved in any way that is humanly possible Thanks in advance Now, I think it is possible to solve it in a way that is humanly possible I'm not sure if it's possible to solve in a way that someone with your supposed IQ can also fix it So, yeah, I wish you luck in further life, but this was not in ballast, my friend You suck You suck real hard Alright, that's got to be it for today If you did enjoy this episode of Is It Inba or Do I Suck, don't forget to subscribe to the YouTube channel as it helps everyone involved. I get a higher number and you guys see my videos appearing your feet Nice Also, smash like Nice."

        "text": "Hello, Harsdam and Company Greetings, and thanks for choosing me You're welcome, buddy I think Hyrosd DPS is way too high, and the Zirk transition to late game is more smoother than the ProDos in general, thus making PVZ to some kind of mid-game pushes, or early game adapts all win Because if you stay too long, you can get destroyed, like me, in this replay I had more upgrades and better unit composition in general, got my expansions in a fair time, definitely not perfect, attacked when I got the advantage, and did some mistakes too Maybe I did throw up a little bit He played well, and I kind of suck a lot But, hydras are still too O P in my humble opinion. Sorry if my English is bad like my gameplay Exterminator, Diamond Protos, N A A couple of interesting things there He seems to be self-aware that he does make some mistakes He accepts that he makes mistakes He says, I'm not perfect Are you perfect? as they say, never throw stones if you live in a glass house I'm not sure how that's applicable here, but don't forget that Now we have the probe here moving out Standard scowling timing We have a Look at this Builds the gateway with this probe, then waits until he can build the Nexus and the cybercore with this probe Now, you could say, this is brilliant, because you don't need to do very much But this is similar. imagine, imagine, imagine this scenario You're a father or a mother, just a hypothetical, okay? I know loads of you probably don't have kids, but if you do, at some point you'll need to drop your kids off at school When you drop your kids off school, quick tip, they will be doing things for themselves. You don't need to stay there until they finish school again, especially you exterminator this probe could have been mining 15, 20, 30 minerals while this gateway is building and you're waiting for minerals for your nexus you could also sit in your car for eight hours like man these days go by real fast just reading the newspaper or Twitter your Twitter feed and refreshing it every three seconds oh still no good tweets oh still no good tweets I don't quite think that is way to move forward though so just send them back all right buddy so why is cybercore so late pylon and no assimilator so the way you're supposed to play is you get 20 nexus 20 nexus and then you get 21 assimilator 22 pylon this guy went something completely different i have no clue what the build order was but But as a result, his cybercore is going to be delayed. His gateway is way too fast This makes absolutely no sense, okay? This absolutely makes no sense Because with the warp gate, what you want is you want it to finish the same time as your second gateway Well, you want your second gateway to finish the same time as warp gate And that's definitely not going to be the case here That's a real issue, actually Okay I do not like that I do not like that because initially you just want to be producing from your tech structures So that's why you get Gateway, Cybernetics Core, and you get Tech, you get Twilight, you get Robo, you get Stargate, and you're investing money into that. And then once your Warpgate finishes, your second gate is coming into play Not before that, not after that, okay? Right now his tech is just super delayed for no reason Usually your first Oracle would probably be pretty close to being done We're talking 20, 15 seconds away He just starts his Stargate right now That's extremely late That's not good Gets a battery. he lost his scouting probe or sent it back too fast and he so he isn't aware of this third base which is I guess somewhat understandable that he then builds a battery but it shouldn't be necessary if you just had a quick oracle because then he's just going to be safe against most things but we can forgive him for the battery okay now usually what you do is after this you get an Nexus um at around this timing and from there on out Actually, you just get a Nexus and then you get maybe secondary tech You get your robot You get your forge You get your Twilight If you want to play double Stargate, you can go and play Double Stargate. Like there's really many options that you can go for But I'm afraid we're not going to be seeing that here, are we? First Oracle starts, or starts building at the point where my second Oracle is basically done already This one I would have killed like 10 workers Rochronic goes down at a good time here Evo Chamber went down at a good time It's looking pretty good here for for Yoda Eater I like his build order His work account is a little bit low, but I can live with that He probably should have one more queen I can live with that That's okay Okay, we have four adapts here shading in. Now let's let's see what he's going to be able to do here with these adepts Okay So you have one queen over here We have 24 links being built right now So he's these Yoda Eater's definitely going to be ready for that Now the beauty with adapts is of course that you can make decisions based on what you see You can make decisions based on what you see This is what I was saying Now look at this, okay? We're at a fork in the road here We have two ways to go Okay? One way we see 20 lanes and one way we see a queen Now, a queen is like a 75-year-old grandma with crutches. She might be dangerous, but she's not going to be too fast And in reality, if you have an Oracle coming, it's like one of your friends with the big guns, you know Not that dangerous Here, 24 links It's the other side of the roads Like, see five guys with guns holding a sign, I want to shoot you It's like, I'm probably going to go to Grandmas side, you know? Just personally is what I would do Does that mean that I condone violence to old people? No, absolutely not If you beat up a grandma and then you say, Harstom told me to do it, I will deny that And this is the little disclaimer that I have for that So absolutely don't do that. Now, finishes the shade, predictably loses everything, kills what? Two, two adepts? No, four links It kills four links It's going to be able to kill maybe one more One more link Five links Five links for four adepts Now, let me remind you that a single ling is 25 minerals, and a single adept is 100 minerals and 25 gas So that's what we call a bad trade deal A very bad trade deal It's a non-approved trade deal even A follow-up is five, six gateways, robo So it's going to be going into a six-gate robo push afterwards This was kind of popular before where you get like three, Oracle, one, Phoenix, and then you get six gates, and you push with one, two immortals, prism. And you can get very strong timing pushes not as common anymore these days, not as common anymore these days, but, wait what? Twilight counts? Okay, this is not a build I mean, if you want a tack after this, you should have taken a third base before getting five extra gates If you invest in infrastructure this early, you need to start using it this early, otherwise it could have been an extra base That's the entire point of the game If you get buildings, you should use them, basically After three base, I can forgive a lot more, but pre-3-base, no, absolutely not Okay, so goes in with another Oracle, uses infinite energy basically here 35, 34, nice. It's like getting your electricity bill, and I'm wondering why you're paying so much because you left the lights on in your house for the entirety of the month Like, oh, that's a lot of money It's going to be the same when it looks at his Oracle's like, huh, why don't have any energy left? That's weird I really thought Oracle's had more energy Maybe I need to charge him by flying him around That's how you get these weird myths on the battle net forums Seven overlords on the way, man He lasers over here Charge, forge, immortal Okay, this is actually just not a build order He's just doing things at this point Yeah, that Robo Bay Just add it as well Keep him coming. Maybe second forge and a second cyber corps Start the fleet beacon as well Then we have all the build. in the game and we can continue it up third base nice okay third base about three and a half minutes too late just three minutes just kidding guys not three and a half just three minutes follows up with Phoenix because his initial error as was so successful he killed exactly one drone he was like I managed to do that with two oracles what if I also built for Phoenixes now let's have a look is this control so far has been absolutely fantastic gets one drone gets a queen, almost gets a queen, loses a phoenix, almost gets a queen, oh, loses two and a half phoenix and got a drone, so two drones. He invested about 1500 resources, maybe 1,600 resources into the oracles, phoenixes and the Stargate He managed to kill two drones and damage one of the queens This is like building four battle cruisers and then Yamatoing a spore then letting them die It's like that's not quite worth it buddy I'm sorry Meanwhile, robo-way being used absolutely brilliantly See no colossi coming out yet, no disruptors either A worker count is a little bit low for eight minutes in game Usually you should be thinking about going up to 75, 76 at this point are made here as 47 It takes a fourth base Okay, just just as a just as a quick recap. He went into six gateways, didn't use them, then build a third base, started using it gateways and then got a fourth base while not being saturated on the third yet This is something else Something else Oh this is also good Oh this is great Okay, so he's getting the thermal lens right now while getting disruptors This is like getting a degree in arts and then start working at the Starbucks It's like it doesn't make a lot of sense, you know? Why did you get your degree in the first place? Congratulations, you're now 80K in depth Like, it's not a cheap upgrade, you know, the thermal lens You got to think about getting that That's just not an easy decision. You got to consider all your options Like, is there any better options here? Double Phoenix Not sure what he's doing But I'm sure they've done lots They got one kill each already now So that means they probably either killed another Ling or, They got an overlord accidentally somewhere that was idling And then without looking he killed it Built some cannon? No This is a good cannon position You guys thought I was going to make fun of Exterminator for this But no, this canon position is good Let me explain to you why This area is very difficult to move through It's kind of tight. If you have cannons here on the left side, it's going to be semi-covering your ramp, at least with detection and with some damage output as well, while still allowing your army to move in position easily This is a good cannon It has the harsh term Ping Seal of approval Next, sends out a zealot Sees the move out This is good Tries to walk into position This is a slight error He should have tried to completely control his ramp, not be afraid here Because the moment you give up this ramp, you can't defend this anymore, because now you're stuck in this area What you're supposed to do now, once your opponent is in such a position, you pull these workers away. way and you accept that you're going to lose this base This is basically the sun cost fallacy in action You know, he's like, oh, if I, if I give up this base, I've already invested so much in it But instead, he's now also going to lose 16 workers, a bunch of his immortals, a bunch of his stalkers Like, it just isn't great He should have saved these probes at least And send him here He would have not been in a bad spot You can still fight afterwards, you know But just give up the base and save the probes You'll be fine, buddy You'll be fine It's not like he had the probes to saturate four bases anyway He was on 60 workers. So all he's really doing is just trying to defend the position That's worthless to him Which isn't great 13 banlings on the way I haven't seen the hydras much in action yet I feel like these hydras haven't really been it You know what I mean? It just really hasn't been it Let's see Still no Colossi being built So the arch degree is being put to good use so far Still 80K in that, don't forget Stasis watch coming down What is our friend doing here? He's going to hive I should probably be looking into getting that seismic spines Relatively soon that upgrade Maybe some adrenal glands as well I mean, he has good upgrades for his melee as well It's getting plus two. It's going to go up a couple more drones, retaking his gases batteries once again in a pretty decent position i don't mind it would have loved this pylon to be a bit further to the back now i'm not a big fan of this composition especially against banling stuff especially from oracle usually from oracle you want to be going into a charge lot arcon storm army charge a lot immortal arcon something like that just more umf the stalker colossi compositions are good but it's more from glave openers or d t drop openers if anyone wants to play those now he has two observers here in his army none on the map His phoenixes are not really scouting anything either. So his main vision is coming from these two station wars that he has on the map When's the last time he scouted? That was about seven minutes ago when the layer finished He's not aware that there's a gas here He's not aware that there's a base here and he's not aware that there's a hive on the way Spire as well Could be looking for greater spire here It's kind of spicy Oh, stars are colossus I completely missed it He already has a colossus So he just got the. all right i'm done with starbucks i'm i'm getting an empty entry drop entry job at my local college there's an arts professor congratulations you're making in the world still 80k in depth adaptive talents being researched storm armor upgrades we present like we didn't see it okay quick ling run by sends his entire army there the classic one-to-punch moves the rest of his army straight into the fourth and kind of gets caught out of position These banings are just going to kill everything, aren't there? No pool on the workers I feel like the hydras haven't really contributed too much yet to the fight. And also, I feel like all of these fights have honestly been very good, or at least cost efficient, or semi-cost efficient for the prodos, no? Yeah, he's just up by 3K resources lost I'm not quite sure how he's complaining about the hydra He just mined less Like, he's down 60 supporters apply, which that's about 2 5 to 3K resources And then he's basically down 6K mined resources, something like that It's like, yeah, no wonder you're losing the game It's looking terrible for you because you just have no workers for the entirety of the game and you're not mining anything It's like a big surprise Now, this move out, we can, I can see this, right? He's desperate He has a pretty big army. He has nice upgrades He did say that I completely un-upgrade or out-upgrade him and got a better army I mean, quality-wise, you probably have a better army, but quantity-wise, like, you just don't have that many units Hello? The good old disruptor move command, double disruptor ball on the same spot, hits one of them, sends the second one forward He just lost two disruptors without hitting anything and still almost wins this fight I don't understand how you can complain here He did lose this fight cost-effectively, cost-efficiency Why so? I have to give him that Now what's going to happen? If this turns into, okay, yeah, he's just going to build broodlord He's just going to build broodlord That's it, no? He has nothing. It's some stalkers It's pretty decent upgrades So in this case, what you want to do, if you think your opponent's going to be attacking you, send a zealot run by in Look at this Whop, whoop, whoop, like this Three zealots here, two zealots here, two zealots here. and sure maybe one or two will get killed but it at least forces your opponent to go back home and it gives you time to react to whatever threat is coming to you and he's getting good upgrades he's has good upgrades on the way he's playing against someone else on 2-1 no carapace upgrades whatsoever so yeah I'm kind of liking this disposition like he's not winning but it's very very playable and that's something that people often overlook they'd be like ah I got so far behind sure but this is a very playable position This is a position where I'd be like, well, I mean, it's not great, but it could have been worse, you know His army isn't that scary. It's what, for Brutlords? Once again, gets completely caught out of position here, by the way Just completely It's not even close He just should be sending Zellets to bases at this point I mean, he probably can take a decent fight as well, actually If he attacks with everything at the same time, blinks forward with stalkers And I think the stock account is too low here Also, instead of right-clicking the Brutelawks properly I think he attacked Brutlings for a bit so it's gonna clear up all the hydras and then just lose to the Brutlords and the two corruptors Another two links got shot by this beautiful disruptor and at this point is just completely over right more links streaming in. Yeah first of all he just has a completely wrong unit composition but even with that unit composition he's using it ineffectively disruptors constantly missing his work account has been abysmal the entire game got caught out of position two, three times, didn't rescue his probes when he could have I mean, I don't understand how he can blame the hydra for his loss That's the one unit he fought well against He's like, people have no clue what they're bad against or why they're losing the game He probably just checked like the unit loss stab or something like that What did he lose the most of? Like, 42 hydras It's probably the hydra that killed me then It's not quite how the game. Works buddy but it wasn't even the unit that got lost the most but yeah gg well played. Wow all just quick recap of the game people have been asking for this so first of all build order sucked. Second of all unit movement terrible. Economy awful. Pro production complete garbage. Decision making when it comes or fight micro was just terrible. That Disruptor micro was abysmal, you just move command it into your opponent's army. You're the reason why people suggest that the Disruptor gets an auto attack, just like the High Templar. You could just aim move it. Nick Prod is even easier. No, I don't want that. That's ridiculous. Your upgrades were good. Your Photon Cannon and Shield Battery placement was good. But you didn't lose against a hydra You lost because you had no clue what was happening on the other side You never interacted with any of your opponent's bases, had zero harass, had zero zero counters to his brute lords really You could have gotten tempest or just way more stalkers If you get like 10, 12 stalkers, you can probably one shot the broodlords at some point If you get plus three, I feel like you have no clue why you lost And also, you definitely didn't lose because of the hyra or because of imbalance And thus, we will have to say, I don't enjoy this You suck But you get one harsome stamp of approval So, you know. potato potato you get what you want now this is going to be it for today if you did enjoy this video don't forget subscribe to my youtube channel uh hopefully by the time this video was live we've already hit 50k in that case good job if we haven't hit 50k yet you guys are pricks click the subscribe button don't forget to like bye bye."

        "text": "Nukes are simply too powerful There is no other way to put it I built two Ultimate Protos armies in this game Firstly, a powerful robot-based force of Colossi with a couple of boom balls for good measure But before the fight could even begin, the Terran nuked my army into oblivion and I lost 70 supply Luckily, I had already been planning for the transition to Skytles after discovering his machinations So I had three targets ready to quickly remax However, once again, he nuked my army to oblivion before the fight could even begin And this time I even had the high ground Obi-one would agree it is very imba that I could ever lose while holding the high ground. Well, I did not harass as much as I maybe should have, and they did have a rather annoying mine, also imba They are invisible Insert angry emoji In my mineral line for a while, I had better upgrades, a better economy, and what should have been a better army I look forward to you confirming that nuke is imba, or do I just suck? Server EU? Leak I play unranked with my opponents usually are around 2 6k This is promising to be a banger already in the literal sense of the word So let's hop straight into this replay as we have Mr X Stream LSO Let's see exactly what he has for us here Tarrin player is just opening up with a. I was going to say a pretty standard opener and then I saw the second gas and I wanted to reach for the bleach to put it in my eyes, but perhaps not the brightest It's a two gate, a classic as well So ideally in the PVT matchup, what we try to do is we try to expand as soon as we can We play Gateway CyberCore at 20, then a Nexus at 20, then a Pylon, a simulator Second Gateway is just not that useful. Especially, well, you can proxy a gateway, then it arrives in time to most of the time maybe cancel that that cc of your opponent but with two gate if your opponent builds a bunker in time there's just going to be a bunker and a bunker is just going to survive like there's no real use um for for the second gate like it doesn't do anything a bunker beats it like that second gate just gets hard countered by a bunker so it doesn't make much chance especially if you then wait 10 seconds before producing any units um our proto scowlia he's called he sold double gas and it's gonna expand no Nexus okay interesting interesting there's still an SV in the main base as well so this is this reaper timing it's very funny how this works that sometimes you watch games wait what the hell and some parts of the build are very tight like this reaper timing is very quick honestly like this is a good reaper timing but then I see this guy proxy factory in the main base and I have no clue what this is I just do not understand this I have a I have a weird feeling though that the invisible widow mine that's going to kill infinite workers is it's probably going to be coming from this factory and I have a feeling this is never going to get stopped this factory is going to be here for a very very long time actually a very long time two stalkers next is what oh no oh it's getting ready for the reaper I like it Nexus can I get a no robo he just this is how we played PVP or PVT back in Wings of Liberty when we didn't have a shield battery no much of my god what a terrible call by me this gets spotted immediately superior stalker movement of extreme LSO absolute madman does it again for soccer is gonna go downstairs boop this Reaper in the head pish get out of here soon no one wants you around um oh and he just moves it over here he actually just flies it back home i'm loving this already no cc yet for our terran nexus goes down now for protos why does it say king of the hill is that something i did i think so let's pretend it's not there i removed it good job kevin um she gets double observers you know what the funny thing is is that if you compare this build to my build, is that I would have the exact same structures as this guy had, except I would just have like 15 extra probes and probably more units as well. I don't think I'd only have four stalkers at this point He plays a one base build to get more units, but there's less units and like 15 less workers They get like the four minute mark, the moment the warp gate finishes Like that's going to be peak if you open with a very late nexus I just don't understand this build. all he's taking gases before the nexus is finished but he doesn't really need that much gas at this moment i feel like also saving up for the carrier switch with the with the chronicles would you look at that 1805 chronobos that's absolutely beautiful chronobo boost is very very useful to spend during the game so you can get a better economy my man here is uh it's not interested in the economy it's not interested he's just interested in the army it's a bigger army it's a Chronobusing a little bit now That's nice That's nice Okay So this observer sees a cyclone and a bunker He decides that's enough information Imagine Imagine if this was the army All right The actual army. We're talking the Dutch army The Dutch military, world renowned for being very small imagine the Dutch military buys a spying drone and they pay a lot of money for it, $2 billion for it, all right? Do you think that they would put it on the edge of the enemy camp? Or do you think that perhaps they might use it to actually see what the other guy is doing instead of just the outskirts of the camp? I'm not sure because I honestly can't remember the last time the Dutch military did anything. I have a feeling a competent military leader though would probably send this bad boy in to check like hey what the hell is going on here like I see a tank I see a cyclone I see a barracks I see an empty tech lab can we get an update on what's happening here you know because perhaps perhaps I don't want to overstep my boundaries here I'm just a a casual observer perhaps Colossus stalker is not the best composition to go if your opponent is opening with two factory tank Helion or tank again never mind what is this widow mine helion with a tech labbed factory and I thought I'd seen it all I thought I'd seen it all I thought I'd seen it all I love the observer positions as well just in case that first one missed the move out he has a second chance You know, you know, scouting around your base, making sure that you're not getting dropped. Sounds pretty good, but what if I can cover the same path with two observers? Now we're thinking, these have to be, if this mind shoots this observer? Is this in range? Pass Pop quiz Did it, did it, titty, titty, t, hey, is this in range? Yes or no Pick your answer now So, then we play some, do-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-cary Boom The answer is, yes It was in Vision-range Good job for everyone who picked yes You can collect your prize in Netherlands Oof You know what would have been great? If my man would have been able to spot this with a unit or with anything, something that perhaps is used for seeing areas There's a different word that I'm observing an area on the map perhaps. If only ProDos has a unit specifically dedicated for that purpose, maybe he would have been able to see this looming threat coming to his main base And he wouldn't have to pull away all of his workers to follow another worker I have no clue what he's doing I actually have no clue what he's doing So if we're in this situation and we know exactly what's going on as we should, we see a bunch a factory, you see second starport What we want to do is, is you want to get a piling over here We want to get a pylon over here We want to get a pylon over here We want to get a pylon over here. We want to get a pylon over here So we cover these edges We know our opponent is playing Mac He's going to be playing very, very passive We want to move on the map We want to out-expand our opponent, focus heavily on improved economy And we don't want to be getting Colossus Stalker Colossus' Stalker is very, very bad because tanks do very well against armored units And thus, Colossi Stalker is absolutely the worst thing you can can be getting What you want to be getting is charge lot arcons and once tors are being added, maybe add a couple of immortals And with charged lot arcone, you're going to have such a good time against tanks, majority of the time. Now, if you do start with a Starwalker Colossi army, because your build order was either Robo or Twilight into Robo and you just have a Colossi, that's okay But you can, what you can do with it is you can move on the map You can try to control this space, try to deny a fourth base or try to deny a third base when your opponent decides to move out You can't attack into tanks with Star Wars. Colossite is simply just not possible wait what the hell just happened here okay this winner mine just got seven kills this is a bit painful as well because this guy's actually kind of spining his money and the Terran is absolutely not the Taryn is floating at this point 5k resources at the nine minute mark now it would be very easier to make fun of the Taryn but let's not forget that the Protos has absolutely no clue that this is the case because the only thing the Protos has seen is that there is a wall technically is not even aware there's a base here yet so there could be 12 battle cruisers here or there could be two marines he has absolutely zero idea and just the fact that you can have no clue that your opponent is saving up 4k resources that is pretty bad okay that is pretty freaking bad. I would I would recommend being a little bit more in touch with your opponent in general You want to kind of feel him out, you know, poke him a little bit And if he, you know, is imagine you're playing a PVZ game and you let your opponent save up 3K minerals, 3K gas, and then all of a certain 30 mutas pop out Like it is nice to understand when your opponent is lacking some units Because if there's this much in the bank, then yeah, there's probably not going to be as many units Right now he's up 50 supply our protos player He's not doing anything with his advantage because he has no clue that he has an advantage. The only thing that he knows is that the stalker hotkey is the S and the Colossus Hotkey is the C That's really all he has He might even have it on like written down on a note next to the PC and just keeps glancing to the left says, oh, still I still see I mean, well a couple more of those bad boys Ding ding ding Ooh, mine. So this mine is also a tell obviously because it shows that there's an armory the moment the mines have these red things above them it means they become invisible after burrowing means there's an armory so it could be a big tell that there is Mac now extrem luso decides to throw down four more gateways as he only actually had four four gateway second robo fourth bases are for losers he doesn't really need that sure he has a little bit of cash in the bank but Ooh, there's the double observer with the Colossi army just in case he loses one This is great Actually, this is a completely unrelated story, but I just want to tell it. Okay, so this is not to do with IOTS But back in 2012, there was a tournament, Tremak Bucharest, which I think Nurt Show won in the end, but it doesn't matter There was a semi-final, no, a quarter-final between Monchi and Starnan, and that was a PVP This is an old man story, okay? We need a bumper for that And Star-Nan did the strategy, an 11-11-gate, 3-gate, I believe, three-gates, I believe, three games in a row, which is a really, really cheesy build And you'd build a pile on the bottom of the ramp and try to warp over it And 11-gate was a way faster gateway than usually you get, usually get like a 13-gate, I believe, in PVP. And the thing that Star-N-did did was he would take, instead of having two pros, or one probe, the proxy of pilot, you would take two probes, the proxy of violent And after the game, Monshi, who was the guy who played against Starnen in the quarterfinal and lost to him, it was like, why the hell would you take two probes? Like you have already zero money with this build Why would you do that? And then Starnon said the legendary words, well, in a lot of my practice games, I tend to lose one So if I take two, if I lose one, then I still have the other And that's some high-level thinking. If you ever want to be in a quarterfinal of a dream of Bucharest, you need to start thinking like this guy So I was going to flame him for the double observer I kind of like it My man Starlin somewhere up there He's not in heaven He's in Sweden, up, you know, up to the north He's looking at this game and he likes it Yeah, yeah This is it, my friend Double observer next to this army Big stuff indeed Okay This is eight zealots. hallucination flies straight into a turret it happens to the best right it can happen to you can happen to me can happen to anyone a couple of disruptors disruptors also extremely useless against tank battle cruiser because it's very difficult to get vision of tanks to throw your disruptors in such a way that they're useful now in theory disruptors out of range tanks because of the the diameter of the what you call it the hitbox of the purification nova makes it so that you slightly outrange i think by half a range you outrange the tank it's very very difficult to do and against mech i would not recommend trying to clear tank lines with disruptors it would just take too long the guy would just move forward with a lot of his tanks and then you have disruptors which are kind of useless against tors however they can be useful but i mean against this army what you want is really just chartled arc on just let's try to translate what we currently have into what we potentially could have if any scouting was done. So right now in army value, okay, so right here for the Terran defending, we have six tanks and four battle cruisers Now four battle cruisers sound scary, but they actually don't kill Arcons and Zealens very fast So really all there's defending here that has big power is six tanks and maybe four helions and I guess the planetary at the third Now imagine If we had the 6 1K in minerals, let's say in 30 or 35 zealettes, and then the 3K in gas, we had in 10 arcons, or maybe 9 arcons and a century, something like that You would completely destroy this army, you just aim of in, you'd have a laugh at him. By the time he kills two of your arcons, the planetary is gone, this base is gone, he's probably thinking about lifting the barracks as well And that's only him trying to kill your second archon Like, there's absolutely no way you're going to lose a game like this You always got to think like this If you're watching a game, it's like, how is it possible that, how can I not win this? And you can just kind of translate the resources that you have into an army that you much rather have, which in this case would be Zellat Arcon Honestly, if you have no clue about the game, I'd always recommend playing Salad Arcon because it's kind of a good composition against most things. It's relatively Amu-friendly as well People like Colossi because they destroy Marines, but Salad Arcon also works very, very well against Bio especially if the bio isn't as well micro, like it is usually in the lower levels Now, I'm an extreme so far It's probably vaguely aware that there is a third base because he sees a sensor tower But in reality, all he's seen so far is a single factory pumping out helions And that's really it Triple three observers Now Star-Nan is watching this with envy from Sweden He's like, ooh, three I should have thought of that back in. What was that? Seeing Ghost get it Ghost Terran there's a non-intended pun three Starports I like it Storm a classic as well against Tank Tank Thor Battlecruiser units that have the tendency to clump right Tanks who doesn't know it the 25 clump Tanks it's a true classic my man extreme LSO really has not done anything this entire game he just build units then is it possible that he does not know where his opponent spawned and he's looking for the spawn location he thinks this is like an expansion or something like that I'm not entirely positive that he's not doing that I want to believe in him but honestly I've I'm not even sure I I cats attacked by a single Hellion. He's a type of guy that that when there's a mosquito in his room, he just throws a grenade in it Like, this is over Dush! The big guns immediately No matter how big the threat or how small the threat, he will bring everything, you know? He's not great to bend He's not great to banter at with the office either He gets fired pretty quickly He tapped him on his left shoulder Then you stand on his right He'll shoot you That's Extreme LSO in a nutshell It's probably not very wise to make this episode about him These are just jokes, Extreme Alaso, okay? This joke is We're friends, right? I don't want to die Please I wonder what he's doing. What goes on in the mind of someone like this? What's an APM? Nice It's pretty decent APM for her, though What is he looking at? Oh no, this is the Terran He was just looking at the map What do these guys do? Okay He moves back He's like he moved a bit to the right, a bit to the left Man, this guy would be great in the salsa class is he actually ever he's maxed you can't build anything made stop selecting your buildings he's looked at his robo four times i think i still can't build anything select my warp gates one more time here's the nuclear nuclear launch thing yeah cyber car she's the dot This has to be on purpose. But I know it isn't You just lost 70 supply Legit 70 supply by walking into a nuke And here comes the faster remax out of three stargates You love to see it I have absolutely no clue what goes on in the head of a guy like this Maybe his head is always empty He's just like one of these meditation masters, you know? There's no thoughts that can come through He's always focusing on the breath He doesn't even hear the notifications It's a lot of battle It's the first time he sees the battle cruise, by the way Let's not forget about it This is great, man This guy's life must be so relaxing What he just did, I'm thinking of an analogy here. Bear with me, okay? Imagine you go into a shop It's a technology shop Now, what do a lot of technology shops have these days? Two things A, they have an aquarium with fish, and B, they sell you a smart watch Imagine Extreme LSO is looking for a new smart watch His last one broke down He's not quite sure how He went swimming with it Some are broke Weird He goes in, ask the guy, the Shupp assistant, hey, I want a smart watch The guy goes, okay, would you like this one, sir? Extreme LSO says, sure, this one looks great Is it waterproof? And the shop assistant goes, no, sir, it's not waterproof Extreme LASO says, okay, that's great school. He pays for the thing, walks to the aquarium, and throws his watch into it, takes his watch out, starts complaining that is broken That's literally what he just did He walks straight into a nuke, loses what he already had The smart word is a good analogy And then he starts complaining that is broken To me, that doesn't make a lot of sense Obviously, this wise shop assistant is not going to refund him this Unbelievable Okay, he does the carrier transition plus two I love that he's adding more colossi. I feel like the one thing I'm really lacking right now against these seven battle cruisers is not perhaps a more, you know, a couple of extra stargates or maybe just add 10 gateways with the 5K that I have in the bank I think if I add two more colossi to my already four. colossi perhaps i will be able to start shooting up magically look this guy this guy's on a mission he cloaked didi to do didi di di di di di di di di di di di di di di di di di tis tis oh no the shop assistant said you know what the insurance will cover this sir here's your second smart watch guess what extreme alazodot walks over to the aquarium Boom! Trows it in Absolutely brilliant This has to be the absolute worst reaction to nukes that I've seen in my life The worst scouting I've seen in my life Pohr! I killed himself as well, that's sad He at least said he I wonder what the takeaway is after a game like this. I feel like it's just information overload There's too many things happening He's My man Extreme LSO is having trouble finding the surrender button here Just like he had trouble finding the nuke dots on the map He's trying to get out of the game for the past 10 seconds He can't do He finally finds it That's legit seven seconds How did he do that? He said already G G at 8 57 He leaves it at 06 Just for 12 seconds he couldn't find it Way more It's like 15 seconds he was looking for it How does he do that? Maybe he controls the mouse with his feet or something like that Like Twitch plays StarCraft Holy crap Extreme LSO Extreme LSO. I don't even understand how you can complain about this There's literally a 30 second warning It's like you don't watch your army for 30 seconds and all of a sudden it's gone How is that possible? He's like, yeah, that's kind of how the game works He went to get a package When he comes back and the game is over? That's ridiculous This guy must be an absolute blast to be with Holy cry I hope he doesn't have a dog He walks away from his dinner for a solid two minutes and bam, his food is gone, dog ate it He starts complaining to the pet shop I bought the dog over here. I leave my food for two and a half minutes and dog eats it tries to get uh. I don't even know what he wants Blizzard to do in this case honestly like what goes through your mind here do you want them to manually push away your units out of the nuke dot like there's not it was clear as day you walked I have no clue this absolutely is not in balance my dude you completely suck you suck extremely hard this was terrible twice he just walked up to you even though you had four observers with your army my man star an still jealous envious he just suck holy crap that's it that's going to be it for today if you did like this episode of iolus don't forget subscribe to my channel because we have hot stuff coming out every single day like buns from the ovens from the ovens Like I'm a bakery and my videos are bread and I'm making them and you're eating them but not paying just pressing the like button.

        "text": "Hi Captain First of all I must say thank you for your admirable work and everything you do for the community You truly are an example for a Protos player and I wish you could keep on keeping on Nice Enough compliments All right Let's jump into the balance complaint Today I played against the player that I would describe as the complete opposite of you This silly Zirk called the Cowboy This abuser might have played everything that is broken about Zerk Drones Means, swarm host, messing roaches and lurkers I admit I played very poorly But let's be honest, I'm not the one who went for a swarm host strategy and lost ten of them without making any damage. I was clearly ahead, but yet couldn't find a way to strike the finishing blow At this point I think he broke the arkey of his keyboard and it allowed him to counter all my harassment I was so afraid to attack the Roach Army on creep and even when I felt I had enough he managed to push me back Only one wave of locust was needed Then in a similar fashion to bad Protos player who make DTs when they feel overwhelmed by their opponent's skills, this guy might have played Protos in the past, the cowboy went for Lurkers Guess what? He won. Even though Lurkers are broken and they should have stayed in Brutwar, I think the game was already over for me, considering I wasn't able to secure my fourth properly It seems so difficult to properly scout and catch the right window to attack against Urk Every time I try to apply my Terence friends' advice to win as Protos, A click more, bro But it fails every time Therefore, I need the expertise of a professional Please, Captain, help me Name Caldwin, league, Grandmaster This is a 5 7K grandmaster protos player And he's playing against the Zir called the Cowboy Now, I'm a little bit familiar with the Cowboy, because that is my account And this is me playing off-race against Caldwin. I can't actually remember this replay I can't remember this game This game must be about a month, a month and a half old, but this sounds like a treat to watch, honestly, silly name called the Cowboy So his main complaints are really that you can make no damage with Swarmhost, I guess, and still just die against roaches and lurkers I guess that's basically going to be it. I feel like he is not, in his email, in his balance complaint he isn't quite sure what is broken he knows he just knows that something is wrong you know sometimes you don't know what is wrong but you just know you know that there's something amiss here that's basically what he's saying he's like i don't know what but it smells it smells funky and you go into a restaurant you order your your your your your spaghetti carbonara and it smells like a a letter boot it's like well you're not quite sure what they did with your carbonara but it's not supposed to smell like a leather boot and it's similar with this game where he's not quite sure what's wrong but this game smells a lot like a letter boot and we're gonna find out what's wrong exactly and i'm i'm honestly feeling for the guy you know swarmos roach is one of the toughest compositions to deal with in this in this game it's it's insanely hard i always kind of compare it to stopping stopping a penalty from in football you know it is possible but uh if the guy taking the penalty kick isn't, you know, less than 60 IQ, it's probably going to be pretty difficult. And it's usually the same when playing against Roach Swarmhost However, he said that he didn't really take any damage from the Roach Swarm Host I doubt that has anything to do with the lack of skill from the cowboy, though This guy has crazy mechanics Look at this Poop, 400 APM Treatment This guy is so fast It's ridiculous How do these guys do it? He's floating 400 minerals The nice thing is I can actually flame the guy who didn't send in the replay for once because it's me This is just making fun of myself at the same time This is going to be a first and probably a last as well This is great I like this. All right, let's have a quick look at the builders Now, this guy is a grandmaster Obviously, has his builds down, right? Adapt, Stargate You're going to be seeing most likely probably a warp gate. after this it gets another adept and a warp gate i kind of like all of that that's completely fine i'm i'm down with that i'm down with that you get the warp gate a little later and then depending on how you feel you can get a third adept or you can get a stalker here it really doesn't matter too much and where's this first adept up first up just looking for my ling and my ling is is waiting for this thing to move out so it's going to go adapt adept stalker which should put a tiny delay in your oracle because you don't quite have enough gas right so that's exactly what we're going to be seeing here you have like a 25 to 20 gas delay on that oracle because adapt adapt stalker just delays it a little bit i i send in my link i managed to run in i get the scout on the stargate uh well the cowboy which is me that's nice this is great and i see that there's a stalker as well so sirk is a pretty good idea of what's happening here whoop Move to the high ground. Good job, Kevin I'm so proud of you, buddy Meanwhile, on the cowboy side of the map, not too much happening, right? Just Drones, Queens Your standard shenanigans, really Nothing too crazy going on over here First Oracle comes out, and this is usually where the fun starts He gets a really fast third base He cut workers for this I knew it. I was like, this is not possible if you play triple gate unit to get such a fast nexus and a pylon as well you're not supposed to cut workers for your third nexus buddy that's absolutely not the play you want to get as many workers as you can like a 10 second earlier nexus isn't that big you know but cutting two probes for that yeah that's pretty that's pretty bad actually that's not what you want to be doing at all like really not what you want to be doing at all you're getting as many workers as you can i go to rass here on the creep tumor pretty happy with that follows it up with a robo i dig it i dig it oh he's he builds robo after second oracle yeah this is completely fine and goes into a void rate which is also okay it's going to allow him to get a lot of damage done with these oracles most likely right because um or more damage because you can clear these overlords once you can clear these overlords uh that tends to be quite uh good for the proto's player because once they clear overlords the the oracles are going to be way harder to be spotted oh does he fly away with both What a player. What a guy Forge Twilight has a follow-up, which is a good follow-up His work account feels a little bit low, though, for whatever reason I think it has something to do with that early on Probe Cut, but also I feel like he just hasn't been producing workers all the way throughout There's a couple of breaks in here Now, of course, I'm going to hold this to a way higher standard, because I know he's Grandmaster, but you legit should have at least nine, maybe even 11, 12 workers at this point We're 5 30 in the game So it's just down like 6, 7 workers for no real reason and that's just kind of bad I guess an overlord, this is good. I kind of like this Oracle oracle into void ray Very often if you open void ray, you clear the first overlord, then your void ray isn't going to get anything else done on the other side of the map But now, still a lot of overlords on the map So that's kind of cool I kind of like that Six overlords in production here My man, E L Laser was giving me some advice, I guess Yeah, the work account is way too low at this point It's going to start Immortals Now, usually you build immortals if you're not sure what's happening, or if you believe you're being Roachalind. I mean, at this point, he's seeing drones moving to the main base at the 6 minute and 10 second mark This is absolutely not a roadshall in Instead of getting these immortals, he should have been investing in extra gateways already You first want to get the extra gate count and then want to get the immortals, if that's possible Gases way too late on the third base as well Gases should have been, they just lost an Oracle Gases should have been going down at like 535, 535, but instead they're not even started yet at this point So they're going to be over a minute late Yeah, this is really, really terrible. That's just going to cost him almost a full arc on that he could have had here, which he's now not going to be able to get That's just sad This managed to reach a good worker count at this point finally and starts adding a couple more gateways It's going to be going up to 10 gateways, which is a good Actually against Swarmholes what you want to be doing is you do want to be getting those 10 gateways before your fourth base Unless your opponent is playing like 80 drones swarmos. It's not that popular anymore or like 75 drones swarmos Unless they do that then yeah just don't take your fourth base too fast Doesn't go in gases in time works in a couple of arcons. I mean this situation kind of looks okay for the toss in my opinion You can just build a couple of batteries battery cannon battery battery battery battery battery I kind of like this and then what Zurk is supposed to do in this case is they just move forward they use their swarmos from here and they kind of fly into your natural and the arcons get stuck over here and it sucks for the Prodols that's basically the entire plan here for the Zurk player now roaches there's not a lot of swarmos though for some reason this cowboy guy is really dumb that much can be obvious first prism setting it across the map is kind of risky in that you can't micro your units it's really nice to have a prism you can micro units a over the wall and B you can pick them up if they're getting surrounded by locust waves here we see my man the cowboy yehah playing some questionable place as well six six seven uh zellad run by into the third base a couple of these batteries are going to go down but really this is just a good initial hold here for caldwin he has an attack going across the map let's take a look a little bit what these zealots are going to be doing so warps in here in the main base oh this is a classic as well look at this five zealots trying to trying to all hit the same spine not really being micro if these salads were controlled this entire mineral line would have gone down and he right clicks that this guy is the ultimate protos player this guy he just aim with zealots he just attacked a spine and an extractor and then right-click my hatchery this cost him a thousand minerals this move this really is a proto's classic a thousand minerals and he killed one spine damaged an extractor and almost managed to snide my layer and this is also another sick move basically you just throw away a thousand minerals for free and they're like you know it'd be sick if i move out after losing 20 supply for nothing that's probably going to be a great idea That's never a great idea. It's a terrible plan Moves back, deservedly so, may I add It's definitely a good call to not attack here It's going to take a fourth base Now, don't forget that the cowboy here is only on 62 workers, really has no extra gases on here, and it's extremely all in If Caldwin just decides to turtle on three bases here, continuous upgrades, which, you know, probably would be a wise idea, no matter whether you're getting a fourth or not I think he's just going to be in a really good spot Like actually in a really good spot I mean, Caldwin is up in the unit's lost tap, playing against someone who's making swarm host Like, you stopped the penalty kick, my friend. The road swarm host time is over Like, all you need to do at this point is you just get storm You know, you can just continue the game Now, there's a mistake that a lot of tosses make and that I tend to make as well is that when you stop the initial swarm host Roach push is that you kind of go like, huh, manage you stop Swarmos Roach? Nice Time to make some real dumb moves now Here we go As I say it, he tries to catch these Swarmost of guard There is no pressure on the Protos to do anything whatsoever Absolutely zero pressure Like, you have defended it. What you do now is, you get storm, you can get your fourth base up, you can start tacking into carriers once you hit like 160, 165 supply and you get storm like imagine okay this is the scenario you're in a bunker okay you're trying to hold a position this is world war two or whatever and all you need to do is hold on until the reinforcements come reinforcements come in like two hours from now you know you're just fighting fighting fighting one hour passes 30 minutes pass so one hour and 30 minutes have passed some quick math right there another 15 minutes pass like all right 15 minutes left and the enemy is basically done you know they aren't even trying anymore and right at that point you decide to get out of your bunker and to just charge into a minefield like you don't need to do any of that you've already held on you defended whatever this was that the cowboy was doing i mean he's still down in units lost this is actually some of the worst road swarms i've seen in my life literally all you need to do at this point is just sit back relax and watch the zirc implode like there's nothing zirc can do at this point he has an army made out of 28 roaches and 12 swarmos which keep being triggered way too fast and then locust i'm not even sure what these locusts are doing i feel ashamed watching this back that's what i feel and you should be feeling ashamed the fact that you're losing to someone who play like this these swarmos could have been anything i'm I might as well have made 10 mutas and just idled them in the top right side of the map. It would have been as useful Like you literally Why don't you get Storm? The impact that Storm would have here compared to adding two more Arcons is so much bigger Like I bet when you're fighting these two archons are going to be standing behind your army majority of the time I love this He's just pushing his arcons forward And the ark's like, guys, you're sure we should be going? Yeah, yeah, yeah Just eat those shots made You're just walking straight through everything This is Yikes I must have been doing something very important over here I lost every single roach I think it could have guided him back forever, but yikers Okay I mean, still, now I kind of like the push. You know, he You think he does these with a ruler where he puts down the first force field, then he gets out his ruler, puts it on the screen It's like, ah, second one, a little bit to the right, and he moves his mouse like an inch, like, takes out this ruler again, dang it's still a hole in the middle, realigns Holy crap, what was that? This legit took him seven seconds to force field, a three force field ramp I've never seen something like this Meanwhile losing Arcons to a single spine So yeah, here Storm would have been great It also would have been great if he kited back or used force fields and Holy crap. If this guy ever needs to build a wall, I don't want to see that Still up, by the way People look at this game and they'll go like, ah, Zirke is ahead He has 180 supply Cirque is in an okay spot here I have to admit, okay, Zirke is in an okay but it's not actually over It's not actually over Cirque is on 59 workers, has no fourth base Sure, there is two, three lurkers, but this army still isn't brilliant There's 1,800 minerals in the bank, which represents about 20 supply, an army in army supply, if you moot macro Like, this actually isn't that bad for the toss. if the tos had a brain obviously this is making a lot of assumptions I understand that also if the Zirk had a brain holy crook he burrowed the swarm host and then burrowed the Lurkers I think that might have been a small misclick I'm gonna go ahead and call it a small misclick now imagine making every mistake possible right as the Protos and then still winning a fight like this because the Zerk also is like negative IQ that's that's fine right now we're back in a situation where you're completely in the driver's seat you have a fort base going up you're up in supply you have 20 more workers now imagine you have a better economy than your opponent and you already have a better or a bigger army what is probably the best thing to do is to try to push that advantage into some type of tech advantage okay so whenever we have an army that is going to be sufficiently uh big to stop any attack in the next five minutes and we have a bigger eco. What we can do is we can try to gain a massive tech advantage because there's no way in hell this Zirk, me, is ever going to be able to afford any normal type of anti-air or anything that can deal with Storm for that matter So if you just tack into Storm or take into Storm and get a fleet beacon, like I think you should, I actually think there's absolutely nothing Zirc can do do here The game just completely ends Like I just don't see it happen Now, the only problem right now that I see is that perhaps the income isn't quite as great for Caldwin as it should be, because he's not retaking this base. So he's going to have a lot of oversaturation, right? He has some oversaturation here, has some oversaturation here That's a decent amount of oversaturation here as well These moves make no sense It, staying on the map here he's playing against the Zerk with no creep who just wants to accidentally win and the only way to do that is through like some counterattack or harass while trying to defend with Lurkers I mean there's not even a fifth base you have a good run-by setup the moment the Zirk moves out he's going to get run by it in three different locations it's like eight roaches I let me warp in two salads I'll work in two more, but just leave them here Two stalkers. See if that works, huh? Sand in the two salads It seems nice Another two units for free You just gifted him 400 minerals and whoop Piss us off again Now there is an observer here, so these roaches are going to end up dying Storm finally is getting research That's looking solid There's a massive immortal count And this is a classic as well, where four roaches distract you so much that the end of the entire army of the Zirk can move across the map, get in a position No Now I'm starting to remember this game It's this guy to not stand in a line, okay? The power of the lurker is that it attacks in a line. So what you want to be doing is you want to be forming a concave That's not possible if there's a nexus here So what you do is you cancel this nexus, you spread out, rather than literally tanking everything This is actually painful to watch Holy crap I look at like four lurkers in the back are hardly fighting Like they join in halfway through the fight Have this fight was just spent getting in position for Caldwin He didn't actually do any damage This is why Zirk lost no supply whatsoever He should have cancelled this base, but he decided not to do it So first of all, he gets distracted by three roaches. This is like when there's a mosquito on your nose shooting it with your own gun, then praying to God that you don't miss Like, you just sense everything there That mosquito is annoying Other guy gets in position And then he takes the absolute world. fight in the history of fights that needs to call G you you know I actually was kind of impressed by this game I have to admit this was an impressive game he held the road swarmost from this brilliant Zirk player extremely well he did some some pretty okay move there was okay actually no there wasn't good harassed at least the intention to harass was there okay he sent in Zellets now the control on those Zellets a little bit debatable but then after that I mean he just keeps pushing the issue well he's the all he needs to do is wait just wait for whatever tech switch you're going to make you're gonna be completely fine called win called win two little probes in the early game your swarm host defense was good I'll give you that your harass was bad your unit movement was terrible your decision-making to attack time after time never worked out once and then your final engagement looked terrible it was awful no other worse for it. Sure, Rhodes-Swarmus is difficult to deal with and I understand that it can be frustrating, but this was not Rhodes-Sormos, my friend This was you and you, you suck That's going to be it All right Thanks for watching I hope you did enjoy this episode of Is It in Murder-Suck?

        "text": "Hi, Harsdam I am a huge fan of IOTUS A US to be a GM on Korean server Now I'm only 4,700, 5,000 MMR, because busy with study In this game, I perfectly defended his harassment His multitask also failed to disturb me However, all caps I found no way to break his damn turtle shell, all caps, even if I'm ahead Terence's bio army moves so quick quick, the static defense with minds and liberators is impossible to break through Terran is born to be turtle, all caps I want you to judge it Is Terran Inba or do I suck? If I suck, please teach me how to beat these turtles P S Terran is my father, T-A-T-P, is a meme in the Chinese protos community. T-A-T-P is a super-salty amateur Protoss always complaining about Terran Imba Nice All right, let's just hop straight into this replay of this extremely imbalanced Terran player who apparently also is an animal, a turtle To be precise, open up that sound, beautiful, beautiful stuff. Now, the thing that we very often see when people complain about Terran being too turtly is that people tend to engage into a position where there's lots of static defense and where there's a lot of units that are defensive seat units or that are in a position, a defense position, either liberators, mines, tanks, they get engaged in rather than the position that's completely empty and then the toss goes, well, turtle everywhere, how am I supposed to beat this? Very often there is simple rotational patterns that Proloss can do, either involving prisms or just army movement that can probably cut off the defensive forces of the terran to a base that they might want to defend now we start by looking at this game and we see an immediate mistake here so oxide is a map this is this is a specific mistake now this is a high level game I'm going to be able to give high level mistakes all right I can tell you guys Oxide is one of the maps Oxide and Jaganata in the current map pool where it's possible to wall of a Reaper ramp and deny the vision of your opponent on what tag you're building. So right now if the Reaper jumps up on here, he still will be able to spot the tag that will be built on this pylon. What you can do is you can build your first pylon here, gateway over here, Cybercor over here, still the Reaper will be able to jump up but you could build your tech potentially here and the reaper will never be able to see where that tech is going to or what that tech is going to be so this is an incorrect wall also makes your pylon more vulnerable than it really needs to be you're going to need the wall with gateway cyber anyway so might as well put your pylon in safety right it's going to be the most vulnerable part of this wall now opening actually looks pretty solid it's nice to see openers that are solid in iodis as well. My man here is going back in with the probe as we see the Taryn open Marine Marine Now Marine Marine is like a safety measure making sure that he won't die to a single adapter basically Then he's going to be going into a reactor afterwards Now Twilight opener should be able to get spotted here by the by the Reaper if he so decides to do it as we see our TATP Protos player moving out on the map with his first adapt Ghost is going to be starting a helion probably for scouting This actually just looks like a very standard game Both of them are playing real build orders This is a real game as I know it. I will be able to give some insights here, hopefully, shade into the natural Now, the thing with the shade into the natural is you don't want to finish this Nice That was a great call, my friend So the reason you don't want to finish it is because the helion pops out between 316 and 318 Meaning if you finish your shade past that timing, there's going to be at least three units out So there can either be Reaper Marine Helion or it can be Reaper Marine Helion is possible And the next, if it's Reaper Marine Marine Marine Halley and next to Marines come soon There's no way you're going to get anything cost efficient done after, I would say, 312. Never finish your shade after 312 And now he just sacrificed his adept for free, basically Good job, buddy Got absolutely nothing done, but did manage to lose your adept Now, he doesn't have a full wall, but he's creating at least a semi-wall Should have probably both of these in that wall as well Yes, there we go This is good This entire interaction, I just want to have a look at it again, because this was great Okay, so he closes the door perfectly, this is fine Helion can't come in, then he's like, oh wait, let me open the door Then the tarant goes, oh no, I'm in, let me leave again and loses the helion. this was something else the thing is I can't even criticize this too much this happens to me as well where you're like I'm not sure if this is actually a wall is it and then you move out and then it definitely isn't a wall anymore I might have had this a couple of too many times again circling all insets as well I have to admit oh yo yoy all right Reaper pops into the main base Pops out So yeah, he's going to be able to scout this This should be able, usually like I said, if you do the wall that I mentioned earlier, this will be denied 100% Also, the Reaper wouldn't be able to just attack your pilot. Now, Reaper is going to die Good movement here by TATP I like the way he plays this Honestly, good vision as well on the map Look at that, hey? Now, I always complain about people not having vision, but this guy, absolutely not He has great vision Pylon over here, pylon over here Now, this move out is a little bit risky So if, if you're If we think about timings, 440 is a pretty standard timing at which a mind-drop could arrive for example If you're halfway across the map with five stalkers, that could be a real issue, especially because you're not going to be able to do much with it And I have no clue what this movement is. What is this? My man, TATP would have had a great time if it was like a raven or a MEDAVec over here But what would happen if the MEDAVAC is here? Does he just give up the mining in his main base? Holy crap, this is risky This is like insanely risky for very mediocre payoff Because imagine if the MEDAVAC flies here, then you just see it fly by Like, crap, still don't manage to get it And you'll still need to go back into position This is super risky and has like no payoff This makes sure absolutely no sense There's like a 10% chance this pays off and if it doesn't pay off like you lose your house. You make a bet with the bank or something like that Holy crap This year I think Argentina is going to win the World Cup It's like not terrible chances but not the greatest chances either and the moment it doesn't happen They actually take your your house and your bank account Did he actually just get something with it? I was so focused on this being a bad move that he actually got something done with it Amazing Even though don't forget, you can still get good things done with bad moves and that that might be what just happened I actually missed it I was so caught in thought there Okay. I like this movement though being here ahead of the in front of the Terrabahs, sorry Loses a stalker though but it It's not the end of the world I mean, I just like that he's here This is good This actually is good You want to be doing that You want to delay your opponents move out He seems to have down when he wants to be building his gateways as well, which can be quite tricky People tend to build him too late or too early, or they don't build them at all, which I guess is also too late So I already covered that scenario Oh, the prism Now, this is one that we don't see very often, but I'm a very big fan of. The prism allows you to counterattack the moment you see your opponent move out so basically you have your vision I guess over here so you see your opponent well guess he doesn't really see his opponent move out but maybe he feels his opponent move out yes you can you can tell by the astral signs and then he moves in with the prism with like two three salads and you just try to you don't want to warp in you just want to force the reinforcements to go back to deal with that okay that's your man go holy crap this My man ghost here has had some issues in the past against the rest You can see it, you know? Two mines over here. Bunker in between an orbital, a depot and another orbital Like this guy is He's been heard one too many times by the prismas The epic stare-off between the two mines and the prism He's like, ooh, let me fly in the first one Ooh, there's another one there One more time I don't think this was the spot to deploy your prison, my friend He saw the Marines I guess Yeah Fine I liked the prism as well I was a fan of that move I'm liking a lot of his moves, honestly Of my man TATP There's also some debateable ones There's some nice observing there by me It goes into a Robo Bay which is good. Now it has a little bit of money in the bank I wouldn't mind if he throws down A Templar Archives rather than a dark shine Darks frame relatively useless in a lot of situations where detection is not going to be much of an issue Solid harassment by the Terran Second Forge going down All of these things are things that I like And he also cares about. vision which is something we don't see a lot here this is someone that actually cares about knowing where his opponent is and he's kind of doing it by eliminating possibilities like hey where could my opponent come from well he can't come from here and can't come from here so he has to be here right you can kind of position your army accordingly which is cool to see now he also sees the third base being built he is lacking some vision on the far left now that he has his fourth base he does have the responsibility to have vision there as well so he's going to end up losing this base most likely well most likely he's just going to end up losing this base as he's i'm actually not sure what he's doing here whenever you do something you should always try to at least have thought about it now that doesn't seem to be the case here for my protos player he seems to just do things you know an impulsive impulsive actions which might sound like a good time until his impulsive actions is to stab you. It's like, yeah, my friends are so spontaneous I always find that a dangerous thing, you know All of my friends are very boring and predictable, so I know I won't get stabbed That's some good thinking right there Jesus Holy crap That was a disruptor shot Now he's just gonna walk in This is over Okay, this is one of those games where you accidentally get one good disruptor shot, and then watch it. do is you just move across the map and you tell your opponent to leave hello can we what was that he got the disruptor shot of a lifetime then decided to sacrifice half of his own army to the opponent as well to even up the game again we can see that t a tp is a fair player you know he cares a lot about fair play making sure that the game is even and that they can go into a a fun long macro game without either of them being ahead That's cool No, it's nice to see that fair play is still alive Okay, so he sees that mine shot He's like, oh, that looks interesting Let me just do nothing about it. Sounds like a lot of work Facts There's another mine here I have no clue how these mines got here, and I don't want to go back in time Please tell me he's going to shoot his own probes with this disruptor What are these disruptors doing? I really wonder what he's looking at as well We can actually figure that out though He's not building probes He hasn't built probes in quite some time, by the way Five necks eye No problem He has an observer now Okay, this goes down now Finally, except for this widow mine still allowed to live A couple of matter facts going into the main base Now, I have a feeling he, oh, he actually is ready This is cool. This was a little bit slow on the response, but it was cool that he already had units prepared In general, he has a lot of units spread out around the map ready for harassment or ready for really whatever He wants to be ready for a good, pick up at a Terran And we see the Terran just pisses of back home right now So Toss is on 5 base right here but has a worker count of 65 Now, he did lose a couple of workers over the past minute, minute and a half, but not enough to say, okay, well, he should probably still be at 75, 80 workers at this point. If you have five nexus, nexai, like within like 20 seconds, you're going to be capable of adding 10 workers And he really should be adding 10 workers It's very, very important Instead, he's going to be moving out He has a good gateway count Does he have a prison? There's no prison with this. Blink under this Blink, blink, blink, blink, no, okay, disruptors Disruptor shots Nice, the double disruptor shots Not many people know this But if you stack disruptor shots They actually do double the damage Except everything dies against a single Disruptor shots So perhaps you might want to spread them out in the future But I mean this fight is still very, very good If he has a prism here You can just warp in 14 zealads absolutely clear of this game He has about 5k resources in the bank right now But he isn't really doing much with it Once again, still should be completely saturated on all of these bases This is actually quite bad at this point. He's missing four or five, 600 minerals a minute on income He just keeps donating units These fights have to be really bad Also, I'm curious when we're going to be seeing the turrets of this terran Because so far this terran has actually been doing things and the only turtling he's been doing is building a bunker and a planetary I guess I don't think that really counts as turtling It's not like he has like 12 liberators and 17 tanks It builds three planetaries at his third He's even dropping and stuff He's doing mine drops Finally, we go to a decent work account, by the way More disruptors on the way I like this. Now, he's still a little bit too ballsy with his moveouts, perhaps. Oh, this could be potentially a good shot. That's going to be a good shot again as well. The problem here is that he gets these pretty decent shots, but then he fights without having reinforcements here while floating like 3K minerals. Now, don't forget 3K minerals equals 30 Zealots. That's 60 supply. So if he'd actually spend his money, he'd literally be maxed right now. I feel like he has no reactions. You know, there's this test called like the human benchmark, where basically what you need to do is the moment the screen turns green, you click and then you get like a time of how fast you responded. And then there's like a curve showing you like how what you call it, how fast you are compared to other people I feel like this guy would be the only person that actually just wouldn't get a score Like he just doesn't respond to things Like things happen and he just sits there This must be one hell of a guy to be in a relationship with Can I already imagine the conversations, you know, him and his wife, him and his husband have That'd be quite something Four salads, nice Disruptor hits absolutely nothing If we look at this position, this is actually a good position for the TOS But because the TOS is TATP, this position is now looking quite bad. It's just because he's not macroing but he has a lot of money He has upper base He even has a prism on the map His opponent isn't turtling at all, by the way I feel like I've been deceived extremely hard by his report There's no indication that this Terran wants to sit at home any more than I do in this pandemic Prism Finally, this is the first time I think we have a prism with the push Now, we take a look at this fight and how we want to fight it, okay? We're just going to analyze the situation here That's important sometimes So we have disruptors, okay? We have four of them, only two of them with this army. But ideally we want to wait until all four of them are here What that means is that we want to be shooting disruptor shots at our opponent without us losing anything. So we stand in a position where it's difficult for the turn to engage into it, and we shoot the disruptor shots, by one and we just keep doing that and every single disruptor shot we're at least going to get one or maybe two maybe three sometimes four or five units okay and then afterwards after we kill enough of the army over a longer period of time because don't forget disruptor shots are free units are not so we're training free things for non-free things that's going to be our goal this is this is actually a very important concept is that we want the fight to last line Now, what doesn't help is that our men TATP actually has a creptone of Zellets in his army because salads are the opposite. Salads want to fight fast, which makes absolutely no sense This is like having an army of swordsmen and nukes, okay? So you send in the guys with the sword and then you nuke it It's like, well, sir, this is these are our guys well, it's like, well, these are the only two weapons we have It just doesn't make a lot of sense There's no synergy there There really isn't You want more ranged units with disruptors Maybe you want some colossus, some stalkers You can use zealot and DTs for run-bys, but not in the army And otherwise, if you want a zealot-based army, you can add arcons and still colossi That also would be good in that case. But this just doesn't make a lot of sense to have an army consisting of four disruptors and 19 zealids It's just a bad army composition So that fight didn't at all go how I'd wanted to go We're still relatively low on income I feel like I want to kind of get a sixth base at this point Maybe start saturating that I mean, he's still upper base Oh my god, how many disruptors has he lost? Thirteen already Holy crap I think this might be the first game, where disruptors haven't been trading cost efficiently And he started with a shot that actually killed like 1500 resources Remember that first shot over here Poof! Okay. So the thing with disruptors is, is basically you always want to be shooting and trading with disruptors, But you also always want to have at least one or two shots available so you can zone your opponent out if he wants to jump on you He just killed two of his own zealots with his shot and nothing else I wonder if he killed more of his own units with disruptors or more of the opponents That was a good split by the way Holy crap The way he moved that That was beautiful by Ghost Wow That was a good split. man the Chinese server is it's got some hidden talents what the hell that's crazy he moved that so in such an elegant fashion poop to the right like he does it 50 times a day nice micro a little bit overstimmed though at the moment no vision as well by the way actually zero vision my man's been fighting in the dark for quite a while like no observer with this army no observer anywhere he hasn't rotated once either It's like keeps attacking the same base over and over If this guy was a military general, the opponent only would need to put their defenses in one base They have like one base camp. You know how in most or you have like multiple camps around the country, but here you just be defending one city He's like, sir, we have no defenses in Rotterdam, no defenses in Amsterdam Are you sure we should put 100% of our troops in the Haig? The guy goes, I am pretty sure Our opponent is TATP, my friend And he only knows one thing, and that is to attack the Hague Now, still no vision Actually, as I said it, of course, he starts a rotation Now, this is good as There's no sensor tower And this isn't turtling, by the way Let's not get this mixed up My man, Ghost, is not turtling He's trying to stay alive. Like, you can't possibly call this guy a turtle all he's trying to do is not die he's been behind for the past 15 minutes and all he wants to do is go into a longer game because he understands his opponent doesn't know how to play a late game at all like he keeps basically force feeding ghost these uh these disruptors like here another disruptor for you for free sirs like no no no more i can't take it Solid run by, good blink, that's nice The blink matters so much The DPS of DTs is absolutely insane, but very many times they won't be able to get on top of the army, like even now. But their first blink, you just get like five, six slices off That's a big deal It really is a big deal So we're still on, what is this, four, four base, one, two, three, four, against six Now income is heavily in favor of TATP He must have lost way more already He's down This is not normal to be down 8K, about 8K in resources laws That's really impressive if you have disruptors But the problem is that he just keeps rallying more and more cells Another thing he does is that he rallies up the robos over here and then kind of sends them over in big chunks rather than one by one, which is extremely rare as well I never see this. Not the worst defense I wouldn't have minded if he pulled away the probes, but They just lose a colossi? They just lose a colossi I feel like the army of the Terran has been consistently crap Like, this army has not been good at all for the past Maybe 10 minutes? What happened here? Oh, this was an F2 from the Terran, a classic Oh, here we go again Sir, the Hague is under siege for the 27 time this game this game Good Good stuff Now this base probably is difficult to break Even though with a couple of disruptors you might be able to do it He actually just hit six of his own zealads. Now I would ask my editor to count if he did more damage to himself or more damage to the other guy but that sounds like a lot of work and god knows we we don't really have the time for that but i have a feeling it's going to be pretty close he definitely hasn't been cost efficient right how many has he lost in this game 20 disruptors he's down still 8k in resources lost i don't understand how you look at these two armies and you think that you should be going back in again with your five stalkers He's like, he's like four marauders, six marines and like six metaphaks, and I have five stalkers and two zealads. I think this is the time to keep fighting Like, this is not the time to keep fighting This base extremely vulnerable, by the way Salad run by would really do some good here We're lacking any type of multitasking, this entire game We haven't seen any prism try to go in, either this angle Even this angle, that's going to be a bit harder with the mines here but at least you should try Now, this base being completely open, the entire game is important as well The micro with disruptors is mediocre Now, I really feel like this Terran hasn't been turtling What he's been doing is he's been setting up bases and defending them against a guy that just constantly been headbutting into it. This is like getting angry at someone for putting up a wall because you can't stop yourself from hitting it with your head He's like, ah, not again There's like two years you have brain damage and you're like man these stupid walls completely ruining my life it's not the wall like there's walls everywhere my friend but you're the only one headbutting into it to disruptors solid rally the the bi-minately that's a word bi-minately every other minute minute Disruptor sacrifice It's something that the ATP is very big on It's in order to keep the game even I can't I don't think I've ever seen 25 disruptors die like this This is insane He just literally has been giving him disruptor after disruptor after disruptor. I'm not sure if he's trying I really am not sure Liberators moving forward So basically what Ghost did this game is that he sat back and the other guy just bumped his head into a wall And then when my man TATP finally fell on the floor like head bleeding, head wounds, ghost just walked over And then TATP kind of fell over That was actually not a bad blink That was a good blink I was going to say this is an interesting blink, but I like that blink He got all of the Liberators Finally, his army consists of Stalker Disruptor rather than Zellat Disruptor. He's actually getting a good trade, even though for the first time he's way down in army supply and he doesn't have money anymore But this was exactly how you want to fight If you're fighting against five, six, disrupter, or liberators This actually was good I like this fight a lot This was sort of, I was going to make fun of him for the blink, but then I look at it again, I'm like, no, this is smart This is a good play This is the only fight he probably had that was semi-cost efficient for him Like, this was, I like that I like, this is something I see a lot, is where people start microing their units the moment they've lost the game. It's like, why would you do that? Wouldn't it be better to start microwing the moment you're winning? they probably just win the game They start trying really hard with like three or four units the moment they only have four units left Like they care more about their four stalkers than they cared about their 35 stalker 28 zealotard army that they just relentlessly kept aim moving into the same location again and again and again into literally the same widow mind that never got cleared He actually didn't hit anything This disruptor has zero kills And then it dies 28 He's down 14,000 minerals and 4,000 gas He's down 18K in resources lost. Now, you might be wondering what do these things mean? They sent me translations He sent me a translation of his own bad manner I absolutely love it This is great Let me read it for you I'll pause the game Protos player says, wah I'm not sure what the what means, but I like it Why you still have money You fail to expand fourth and fifth for a while And then the Terran says, I banked up a lot. my fourth is still mining then the proto says oh you're fifth and sixth dot dot and then he ends with GG I guess we're not there yet this is this is great this gives us a little bit of extra insight into the mind of TATP where he actually believed he was trading efficiently if this is what trading efficiently looks like, then Terran would be completely underpowered in TVP Like, if this is what the TOS needs to do to trade efficiently, then yes, ProTos is completely in balance Because holy crap, the TOS micro was so bad His unit control, the positioning, the army composition, anything to do with fighting It's funny because his early game was so nice The ideas behind it were nice. His initial, like the first seven, eight minutes, they just looked Okay, not brilliant, but at least somewhat fine Like the move with the prism, the initial stalker move out are a little bit dicey, but Wait, has the game ended? I guess so I don't know It's just It just makes me sad that someone can play this well in certain parts and then literally do everything else wrong for the remaining 15, 16 minutes of the game Like, you're so close by. but also so extremely far away ghost didn't turtle you just it's a bit like in fight club you know where the guy fights with himself it's like that issue you're just struggling what you're beating yourself up and ghost is just there it's like his bag of popcorn like it's looking good there buddy it's like stop turtling dish dish it's like this has nothing to do with turtling you're just beating yourself up over nothing and then ghost absolutely destroy you This is an insane unit's loss step for a TVP Insane Especially because Ghost mainly had Marauder Marine So, yeah, my verdict, you suck Absolutely, you suck There's no two ways around it Congratulations, my friend You are the ultimate sucker. Now, that's sadly going to be it for another fantastic episode from the Chinese server the Chinese replays have honestly been extremely high quality and very, very fun to cast So thanks so much for all my Chinese fans as well I know you guys watch my videos on Billy Billy I appreciate it And for everyone on YouTube here, a like down below, subscribe and comment as well Tell me what you thought of this game and of my man TATB Thank you all for watching and see you all next time for a new video Bye-bye."

You're gonna have to edit all of this out Bera-be-de-be-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-dh Bap-pppppbap-pbbbbbbh Thurbdap to the other side Alright Alright, de da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da Alright Yeat I'm sure I did that Edit that out you prick or I'll come and find you in Germany I know where you live Dear Harstam I'm a platinum one terran player who today played versus a diamond three Zirk player I was able to scout and anticipate everything he was doing perfectly That's all caps I fully prepared and beat his Zirgling flood I then beat his Rosebush after that But I still lost the mess Hydro Lisk afterwards His Hydrolusk were everywhere They killed my harassing banshees. They destroyed all my counter-attacks and eviscerated my tanks It's hard enough having to play against the race that can just press down on Z and R all they Z And R all day Why does Zerk get Hydrolys too? Hydra's and all of Zerk early game are hopelessly broken Is it imba or do I suck? Your devoted fan, Diabolus P S You are the only StarCher YouTuber whose videos I actually hit like on Nice I already like this guy I'm pretty sure this is imbalance So it's a Terran platinum one from the American server It's at 3 6KMR or something like that I don't know Don't read my emails. So let's just hop straight into it, right? We have our man Diabolus over here, opening up with a depot at the ramp as every proper Terran shoot And he said, I struggle with everything in the early game And he kind of classified Hydra in the early game there, which I'm curious to see how fast these hydras are going to be, or how long this guy's boundaries, how big the boundaries are for the early game in Diabolus's head I mean, there's not really a Diabolus, is it? It's with an OU, Diabolu, Laos Laos I'm not quite sure how to pronounce that Laos Diabolouse Nice 12 pool for fish bat, cool name by the way. I'm not sure why I like it, but I'm a fan 12-poo's not a very good strategy against Taryn because Taryn has this ability to wall and build command centers on the high ground So if Taryn scouts, I think they just cancel the low-grounds, and rebuild it on the high ground, and they're ahead You can just get a reaper, and then you push away the Zirklings, put the CC on the low-ground, and you win At least in my head, that's what's going to happen But we'll see what my man, Dia Boulos, is going to be doing He's going to be scouting at least, which is big Scouting is important, especially against 12-poo. Is the Reaper just going to be out in time for this? By the time these Lings hit, the Reaper will just be out, right? This has to be it I don't think 12-pool is actually very good But it's only going to be eight Lings, so it's usually against the, what the heck? Get straight gas as well So he's going to have really crap eco here Like, this eco is absolutely atrocious I can guarantee you that, my friends Okay, so this thing gets taken out You can cancel this, I guess, and then you could send down the Reaper as well It's just going to go for a little walk For everyone who missed that, look at what happens here My man said, he responded perfectly Holy crap look at this look at the response time as all this has been happening for 20 seconds no cancel if this is a perfect response to 12 pool you better run for your life if this guy says he has the perfect dish for you to taste I'm not sure what it's poisoned with but I ain't touching that holy crap that's awful gets a factor he just lost 400 minerals for now Well, 300 minerals You only get 75% back, right? So that's absolutely terrible start here for Diabolus I mean, you hold, but this is not really holding either He's like the If you've seen the Holy Grill, it's like the Black Knight. It's like no arms, no legs left He's like, but I'm still alive I'll bite your head off. like this is not a good situation like you didn't die against eight slowlings good job but you lost the CC that you didn't cancel that's awful this is going to be a good replay I had a good feeling already about it once I read that email and he had two words in all caps you already know it's going to be a banger because people who think that in order to give their email more power they need to write in all caps they tend to not be the brightest one in the the brightest one of the bunch and he had two words in all caps You already know it's going to be a banger. Because people who think that in order to give their even more power, they need to write in all caps, they tend to not be the brightest one in the brightest one of the bunch Follow this up with a straight tank He's still in defensive mode You see that? He's like, damn, I'm getting all in really hard here right now He opened up with 12-8 links So the best thing I can do is not scout with my Reaper ever and start building tank, bunker on the high ground the high ground, then I built my CC in a position where it could potentially be bile from the low ground if there actually wasn't all in. So a lot of good decisions being made here with Diabolus, not Roach warring goes down Okay, so this is what I think is going to happen is, I think my man fish bat here is probably just afraid of dying right now He's like, well, I killed the CC Then he's going to build roaches Diabolus is going to see these roaches and think, oh, I'm being Rochall-Ind Let me build three more bunkers and four more tanks before I go take my natural Meanwhile, our boy Fishpad here, completely outmining his opponent Main base is getting muled out You see this patch only 255 minerals left over here, 255 He's not quite running out of minerals, but it actually won't be too long from now. And that's kind of scary That's kind of scary So here comes the Speedlinks And these are safety roaches These are not roaches saying, hey, I'm going to go kill you These are roaches like, holy crap I have no clue what you're doing, but you don't have an expo yet So, yeah, I guess I'm just going to be building units Like, he's just afraid of dying He sees two tanks He's like, oh, crap This is going to be a contain, not an attack Like, he might poke up to see, hey, there's still three tanks there or two tanks there Follow up his benchy as well I just love this I think this is Secondary wall This guy is extremely defensive Like nothing happened, dude. He sent eight links This is your response? He probably, my man Diabolus, is going to be the most jealous boyfriend in the world as well You know, the classic where like one of the co-workers says hi to his girlfriend, where they're out on about, and he'll be grilling his girl. three hours about who that was and he's just you know it tracks her GPS location all the time my man Diabolus absolutely has some jealousy issues holy crap what is this Benchy tank oh no okay that's gonna happen he's gonna fly down see the road should be like up out of here again flies back up I can almost guarantee you this I can feel it he's scouting with the CC Sees the roachers back home Single Benji scouting there's a third base going up Somewhere in the back of his head right now a voice should be going, well, if that's a third base, probably has a second base as well And he has a lot of roaches. I bet he must have no drones on the natural, but he's getting a third That doesn't make sense Right now, oh Diabolus is actually going to move down Oh yes, three tanks now So we can slowly but surely leapfrog forward Tank in the Moves it down two inches further than the tank on the high ground I love it This one being completely useless as well, the extra backup defense, in case the roaches decide to go behind the minerals here Like that there's no tank over here Sacrifices his marines for free This tank's actually gonna shoot This makes me angry It gets one tank. it's okay if he moves over here now this tank actually was useful and I'm gonna hate it I hate you fish bet I hate you I hate you I'll joke aside fish but still in a fantastic position obviously denying the mining here probably not worth the roaches he's losing currently but he's still going to be in a good spot 33 workers against 30 though so he does need to be a little bit careful 30 Cc also finished up at this point Actually, Diabolus might have accidentally gotten a hat There's still 1,200 minerals in the bank Okay, here comes the famous Hydra then follow-up Double Evo as well No third base yet from a man Finally starts some mining here Mainbase mined out. It's five patches left He was on one base for the first seven minutes and 30 seconds in this game Because his opponent builds six links, eight links at the start This is great He hasn't even started stim yet That's how Afridia is Adds three extra barracks He's like, yeah, maybe time to add some barracks as well Thinking about perhaps doing some damage in the in the next five minutes His opponent meanwhile, getting hydra muscled augment or whatever it's called, the hydra speed Oh God, this is not good This is not good for Diabolus Well, actually, if we look objectively, at this situation right now And I can do that, because I am very objective The work account is equal There's triple CC. I guess he has a bunch of tanks, so he can't really die He's actually ahead I'm not sure how it happened But I guess our man, Fishpat just lost his dirt and hasn't been spending larva or injecting So, he's a lot of queens, though He's just been floating a lot of money That's okay We're not here to criticize fish bat, but we just want to pinpoint like, hey, where is it going room for fishbed here? Because I'm also interested in his origin story, you know It goes into eight gas All right You do you Three extra depots in the wall Still afraid Extremely afraid Oh, I love this Undefended third base Please lift it Okay Thank God. really afraid that he was going to forget about the lift ability Does he fly in there? That's relatively close But no cigar I love this tank position as well, straight in front This is very smart because if you force the ravagers to attack the tank, they can't be taking down important structures like the supply depots, right? Now supply depots might not offer the same defense as a tank back here would, but they do ensure that you can build more units. So, if you think about it, it in in chicken and egg terms you know no one knows what came first the chicken or the egg but we do know what came first here and that's the supply depot without supply depot no tank and that's the real good thinking that the Abolus is doing in this game three Benchies gonna be cleaning this up he's in a fantastic spot right now lost a couple of workers but if he considered rebuilding an SCV Okay, good That burned down from legit 350 HP All right, back to my sentence If he considered rebuilding an SCV, then he's going to be in a good spot real fast again. Now he has a nice army consisting of five racks, one star port, one factory production, and he's building marauders, marines, six tanks, and banning Benchies, getting storming combat shield Apparently Metafax are for idiots, so are upgrades I mean, this is not really an army that's easy to attack with There's no real body in this army All the units are pretty much support units Like you have a Raven and four tanks Like these are great if you have a bunch of marines, but And then the real support unit he needs is the Metafact, but instead he's just continuously building Benchies. So he move commands past it at first, banshees fly too far, loses all of his tanks, then manages to clean it up with these bensies eventually and with the auto turret Now, if you think about how Zirk works, is that usually they create quite a few units from their larvae if they're being attacked This is not a wise decision to keep attacking here The wise decision here would be to go back very rapidly But instead he's going to get two hydras. three hydras loses I mean this is honestly not bad so he got I think one roach and two hydras and he only lost four benches a raven and three marauders so if you look at that in the unit lost up you'll see it's not great for Diabolus but he did kill a couple of hydras and hydras of course are very dangerous so yeah I think generally that could be considered a terrible decision but if we compare it to previous decisions of Diabolus it If the average decision of Diabolus is a six, then this decision will rate it as about an eight. Sure, it's one of the worst traits you can possibly take, but that tells us a lot about the previous decisions our man Diabolus has been making so far Diabolus defending this ramp, not realizing that his third base is getting right-clicked I wish there was a way to get any type of vision, like sending a marine here, or maybe, you know what Terran could really use? It's a building that kind of creates a vision circle around it, and it shows when units enter it Not necessarily with, hey, this is a roach, but like something like a little red exclamation mark that would show, hey, there is a unit here, maybe get in position. Or what he also could have done is maybe have one tank here or two tanks here and then the rest of your army here, like split it up, like you actually know how to play the game These are all just suggestions, of course These are not things that he has to do Oh, look, yeah, this is smart This is a sensor tower now I like that Why can't I click it? Hello? There we go But he now does the opposite He defends his third CC, and then the rotation here that took about five minutes to complete from fish bat It's going to catch him off guard completely again Don't forget he said hydras are everywhere. but what he really meant is that the hydras went into one location at a time and I never was in position and it really is this is insane this is a great game it's going to get right-click again on the next base he's going to unseach those tanks or he's going to forget about the tanks I wonder what's more likely maybe he's going to just leave them there and then lose them to these units is also possible I think that's exactly what's going to happen That he's going to lose this CC and then he's going to leave him I hope he flames a little bit or something like that That would really add some spice into this game No G G. gets called and our man Diabolus leaves the game, loses, and Fishbet wins Well, Diabolus Mike arms squeaks Let's recall what happened in this game You didn't cancel your CC You stayed on one base For the majority of the game actually, we know now, it was 14 minute game You stayed on one base for seven minutes and 30 seconds You are a terrible partner to your girlfriend You don't micro You have just no micro I'm not even going to call it bad micro In order for something to be bad, there has to be something There was nothing here. this is like giving someone an empty plate and then asking how does it taste and I'll be like it's air there is nothing on the plate your plate doesn't contain any micro it has no decision making this entire game was just void of of a lot of things people often ask for advice and ask me hey how do I improve I say hey get better at micro or get better at at decision making but you just don't have these things I didn't know this was possible You have to start from zero You have nothing You need to create these things out of thin air That's going to be a difficult and long process, and I don't really want to help you with it. You suck You suck extremely hard Nice All right, guys, if you did enjoy this video, don't forget to subscribe to my YouTube channel Please smash the like button, as it helps me a lot as well, and I'll hopefully see you all next time for a new video Bye-bye."

        "text": "Dear Harsdam, after showcasing you the incredible strength of Hydra Corruptor, I've got another beautiful game for you At the highest level, it's popular to play Hydra Lurker, Viper, Infaster, Queen Spore, while doing counter-attacks with Ultra Ling Bain versus Skytos But because I'm only able to average 350 to 400 APM in the late game, I can't really micro that army well enough You're not tricking anyone here, Loco 400 APM? You? Instead, I've been playing Ultra Hydra. microbial shroud slash fungal and it's been working really well in this game I clearly should have switched to lurkers instead of ultras but did he really win because he played better than me or is it imba loco all right a repeat defender here in mr loco himself that's kind of interesting let's have a look to see exactly what's going on here in this game as in the bottom right corner spawning as the blue zur it's going to be imposter which I guess is a loco's smurf account and in the top left spawning as the red proto it is oh oh oh oh it looks like two eyes with eyebrows above it a little nose in between so he says he's struggling with sky tolls he has a he has a composition against it so we already got a you know we got to give some credit to a logo where credit is due of course because it seems like he managed to finally stick with the program. Not only did he start growing in size, but also he finally managed to actually keep it a unit comp, and maybe he can then improve on it That's, of course, the best way to always improve in StarCraft is rather than swapping your unit composition around 17 times a game because you don't think it's working, you just try with one unit composition, and you can kind of adjust it if you don't think it's working So he said, hey, hey, Kevin, here I played, what was it, Ultra Hydra, investor I think I should have added Lurker instead at the end But can you have a look at it? Or was it imbalanced? And you know, these are fair questions, loco. We're just going to have a look at it Is Keitel's imbalance? Now, a lot of people struggle with it We had a real gang earlier this year who struggled with it and complained a little bit So he even made a video response to the IOTIS That's the first But that's not what we're here to talk about Now we're here to talk about Mr Loco, opening up with the standard hatchery, scouting around, with his first overlords as any good Zerg would do We're going to see that there was a forge opener, but I think this probe got pushed away by a drone Loco is quick on the responses there, so so far, I really just want to say good job, loco. Your opening looks absolutely marvelous. I am a proud Protoss player. I'm a proud content from one Dutch content creator to the other I say, good job, Loco, you're fantastic. So we have the first Overlord going in and sees, hey, Cannon going up, Cybernetics Core, there's about three minutes too late. Hmm, I wonder what this could be. Now, Loco, the smart man that he is, rather than checking the second Pylon, he decides to just go back. So if you see a Cybernetics Core this late, probably the tech is going to go down the moment the Cybernetics Core finishes. And at that point, there can't be a Stalker out yet because you see the Cybernetics Core finish. Now, this is a tip for people who play against people that play bad build orders Like this, what OO is doing here, is a bad build order But that means you should be abusing them that this overlord should be scouting that Stargate for free because the stalker couldn't have been out yet So you just go to wherever the second pilot is You have plenty of time to look for it And then you can escape to the back of the base Just a little bit of advice, not going to be the biggest of deals here I mean, if at the level that Loco is at, which is I think about 5-2, 5 3K MMR, maybe a little higher even, 5-4, I'm not sure. That level, the moment you see a forge in the wall and you see someone build a straight cannon, you know it's going to be aeratols and Local probably knows it's going to be Airtles at this point already as well We see the toll open up with a straight Voidre, and I mean the Voidre is just going to get rallied to the Overlord, so Local is going to get that information eventually, but obviously you'd rather have it sooner rather than later I like that he's patrolling He had a fast speed, by the way Holy crap, 333 has speed finished He must have pulled in gas He really cares about getting that speed fast. What you usually do is you rally drones into gas, and you get your speed at like 3 45, 3 You're going to be pretty okay with that most of the time But loco, no, no, no He's a fast man He wants to finish things quick, my friends He's bang, in and out He didn't even notice he was there Yeah, so it gets the speed very, very rapidly Voidre starts kind of patrolling along the edges of this map, trying to look for perhaps a second overlord Locke wisely pulls back his overlord that was above his main base. It's like, you know what? there's a void ray here is probably going to be going for double evo chamber okay that's interesting so usually you don't really see double evo chamber because a single void ray isn't necessarily an indicator of like hey i'm going skydolls it could also mean hey i'm following this up with a glaive in and then double evo chamber is kind of useless you want a rotor on against that uh so you kind of want to get a safety rotor on whenever uh any every single game actually has a zirk just in case of like some delayed glaive depth timing Loco is going to get that road to iron, albeit a little bit late. I can kind of live with it As we see, this tool's very focused on getting this extractor I'm not sure what this extractor did wrong to him, but yeah, the logo is going to be like, oh, that's awful You're going to take that out I'm just going to take it over here, I guess And RICO, man, no half-mesters in this game so far And Locos is actually going to get a scout, and I love this He managed to hide this overlord, kind of in plain sight And he's going to see, hey, storm, a single void ray so far Did he spot the Oracle yet? Now, the Oracle is over here at the Natural. So he sees quick storm, and Locos' response is going to be, hey, you know what? I see Quick Storm I'm sure there's a void ray, but I'm just going to be going into range upgrades and probably go into roaches and a couple of hydras from there on out Maybe keep a couple of queens to get a creep spread, by the way Man, loco is actually improving This is not looking too bad Now, I must say this is not looking too bad, but maybe someone else will disagree with it As I heard, yeah, our new reporter is ready with a little bit of the early game review What is your name again? Okwal? Okwold. What do you think so far? Hmm, I think this guy is doing great, whoever he is And I believe if he loses, it's probably because of imbalance Back to you, Kevin Very, very interesting I feel like I've seen that guy somewhere before, but I can't quite put my finger on it But if he says it looks fine and it looks good, then we just got to trust him, right? These new young reporters are lots of enthusiasm in them and love to see it Just love to see it Continue with the game, 67 workers here for our main man, a loco. against the 51 so it's looking healthy now you could say perhaps a fort base would not be a luxury or it would actually be kind of a necessity at this point so even though roaches are good to kind of to kind of build you still want to know for sure hey this is not going to be an actual sky toss follow up right because if you're just going to be focusing solely on roaches and it is a sky toss follow up you could be in a little bit of trouble so even though at this point It's all looking great for Loco I'd love to see, yes, this follow-up scout This is absolutely beautiful I'm definitely a big fan of that. I think that's good Follow-up scouts are very, very important He also keeps scouting with this Ling, his crease thread is looking solid, his upgrades are going fast Locco is on point If we compare this to old Loco, this guy has improved a lot Throwing down a Hydra then as well What is it? Sands back the overs here You gotta be kidding me Loco I was just praising you so much Loco? He's gonna put it with his main art Are you joking? We need to know if there's air units There is now a second void ray Locke's gonna go for a pure road rush against someone that's making more void rays This is a little bit how the US gets their intel. You know, they kind of get close to the country They wanna invade and like, yeah, Vietnam looks doable with what we currently have Let's go in Let's see how it will go for Loco Locco, of course, man of big preparation, last thing he saw was a Templar archives, and that was only four minutes ago, so that's probably still pretty accurate, right? He's first into his stasis A couple of cannons, he sees a Templar See if he tanks the storm with his face as well Yeah, sure It's not too much you can do there And then the void race show up Okay, wait a second It's kind of annoying. It's two void race and the Oracle there? I guess I kind of do need units that shoot up So after last time getting hydrant corruptors to beat battle cruisers, this time he decided to go the other way around He's like, ah, he's air units I remember last time Big Harsden told me that I had too much anti-air Let's try it with just pure roach this time I'm not a fan of that And you could say, well, what Loco tried to do here is he just tries to poke with the roaches to see exactly what's going on. But poking with the roaches into a couple of void rays is like stabbing yourself in the stomach with a knife to check if the knife is sharp Like sure, you're going to find out if the knife is sharp, but surely there has to be a better way than this Overseer, stays alive, which I'm kind of happy about He's going to go again there's a couple of hydras This is a good addition He has good upgrades His supply is good And his creep thread is fantastic Just pause and zoom in on this Like, holy crap, loco I'm not quite sure what he's been taken I do know that he's from the Netherlands. So you never know what these guys put in their coffee in the morning Like he's on fire, man There's creep everywhere It's like seven, what is it? One, two, three, four Five roads of creep Five creep lanes Five bases already Sure, he's a little bit supply block Sure that the max isn't as quick as perhaps Sarah would have done it, but, you know, this isn't bad This is looking pretty good It's moving back, moving forward, sniping sniping Templar, left, right and center Man, he's absolutely destroying his opponent here This is almost textbook I love this Local Now, that's the good news, of course, for us. The bad news is that Loco somehow manages to still find a way to eventually lose this game, which looking at the current situation is almost more impressive than sad Almost It is probably still going to be more sad than impressive in the end Ten more hydras on the way Well, 10 hydras, 17, 18 hydras All right, Loco Relax their buddy Calm down What do we have? I think we already have Yeah saw pathogen glens, so infester is the next move He did talk about hydra, hydra infester, right? We did hear him We talked about hydra infester, ultra I'm not sure what the ultras are for, but you love to see it No, piss off, Rainer It's not your turn yet. You got to wait your turn, man Just sit back and relax, okay? No, no one really cares about your opinion Go away fans right we're worried a bunch of hydras he said he was going to go into he's getting a sixth base or a man loco you beast you macro monster you injecting idiot no wait you super good player pulling the queens we're going all out here loco I am loving it I'm loving what I'm seeing here No extra range, that's fine, ultra cavern Okay, loco, let's do it The final march This is like when the trees start hitting the tower in Eisengard, man This is about this epic, except instead of the trees, it's the queens. And instead of Eisengard, it's a Protos base Instead of cool guys in Lord of the Rings, it's Loco But I think it's pretty close analogy-wise If it's a stasis wars going down Microm and Loco is on fire Holy crap I know he's big on coffee but this can't be just the coffee Look at that man It's unbelievable He's taking out everything He's up 60 supply Sure the Queens was a bit of a wild move 11 minutes in He takes down the fort base Perhaps we could get some target fire on the Templar But I don't even mind all of this I don't mind any of this at all loco You're playing a fantastic take putting him back on three He's on six. He's on six We can just go back Sure, we can chase onto the ramp, but is that really what we want to do? We don't quite know how many storms there is Okay Back up local Breathe in, breathe out Now, if we evaluate this position, we're local in this case, right? So that's a three I'm sure what he wants A little bit too much coffee this morning, Loco Evaluate this situation, right? So Loco has seen, I think, two immortals already He's seen two immortals, eight Templar, eight, eight or nine Templar, and like five to six carriers and like a single arc on This army is largely designed to kill ground This is not an army that attacks well into the air. You could say, well, carriers are kind of okay against air, and there's a single arc on If we have like a solid 15, 20 corruptors here, that's going to be very, very rough Or even if you start playing with like vipers and pulling them into your hydros, that probably would be pretty sick as well. The one thing I wouldn't recommend against the, guy who's making an anti-ground army is to get ultras because there's going to be immortals in it now loco only saw a single or maybe two immortals so he can be completely aware of it but you've got to be very careful with these things I always say you want to stick with a composition you want to have a plan but you through the experience with getting better in your plan you need to be able to be kind of flexible with your plan you got to make small reactions now this doesn't mean that from Mass Hydra, all of a sudden you start sacrificing all your hydras just to rebuild 35 corruptors? No, you kind of want to use the units you currently have and slowly try to trade them out for an army that is more adept at fighting your opponent's army, basically. That's kind of what you're aiming for when you're into, in a late game situation like this. I like the Investor Edition, Microbial Shrout, what's it called, the Entangle? holy crap neural parasite this is what happens played this game for 10 years 12 hours a day i can't even remember anything of neural parasite the amount of units i lost to that spell is insane but yeah you always got to be a little bit careful there as a as a player that your tech switches aren't too in too quick you know you don't want to be like okay here you go here's 40 hydras and loco isn't doing that loco's doing this solid he's going okay i got my hydras i just had in a couple of ultras now what you want to be doing is you probably want to be setting up a good fight or be just a little bit patient look look look look look at what loco currently has okay he has everything the entire map is his he is on six bases one two six okay creep everywhere he could take this basically he's going to out-expand his opponent like a madman he has more money in the bank and he's not been fighting poorly but he's going to be able to take like two bases of his opponent three bases of his opponent, it's going to be legit 10 base against four. Okay Now, Locus Micro isn't known to be the best This game, it hasn't been bad, but in general, it isn't not to be the best But if you can't win with 10 bases against four, perhaps it's just time to switch to a different game Like, just go play some casual Tetras or something like that, you know, just start beating the neighborhood kids in competitive Pac-Man But those games are just, those games, are pretty difficult An easier game The game with the raccoon where you have to build stuff That's more for you I can't remember the name It's the scummy raccoon You guys know what I'm talking about Attacking into this, we'll see how it goes We'll see how it goes, Loco. So we see two ultras are almost continuously fighting They all die because there's like 17 immortals The carriers don't actually have that much DPS They're not the main DPS in the army That's going to be the storm and the immortals So Loco goes in He's like, ooh Oh Lost all my ultras for free He killed like three salads Hmm Six new ultras All right Interesting call here, Loco Interesting call indeed I'm not quite sure if this is how it works This is one of those times where you kind of want to switch something up And if you want to rebuild ultras and then wait for your opponent to move out and then fight into him, I can kind of see it more. But you just saw he had like five, six immortals He's on four bases Your opponent isn't going to be the one that's going to be quick at tech switching He won't really have that much money for that He won't have the gas This is pretty much the army This dude is going to be stuck He isn't even max yet Like, this is not looking tight What you want to be doing here is local, probably want to be getting either into some corruptors I don't even mind the Lurker call, but at least try to add a couple of Vipers So you can try and take either Arcons, Immortals, or even some carriers into your units. And with Vipers, in theory, you have infinite time, especially if you have your opponent contained on four bases and you have access to a potential 10 Phipers can't really die against feedback so you can heal them Sure, you're going to lose time, which is also a resource, but loco really has plenty of time on his hands The longer the game goes, the better it's going to go for him I like this Quick rotation to the other side It's kind of smart I feel like he's also not quite understanding how microbial shroud works So microbial shroud, for the people to know, it reduces the damage by about 50% from air attacks. Now, contrary to popular belief, or at least contrary to Locos believe, immortals are not flying units I have made the suggestion multiple times on the Blizzard forums, but so far no reply from anyone at Blizzard This means that microbial shroud does absolutely nothing As ultras are mainly going to be attacked by the immortals and get their main DPS from the immortals, perhaps don't cast it on the ultras and just use your inferring. Infestors for for for neural this is like to a man with a hammer every problem looks like a nil and for loco with microbial shroud every unit looks like an air unit we can we can count this as a seven out of ten joke it wasn't my best not my best work but yet you you probably just want to be working on your Bile, there's really not that much air damage, especially because this guy is somehow on plus one attack while you have plus three carapace Like, I don't think the carriers are going to be the real issue And this is really the painful thing in this game for me is that this isn't really Air Toss Loco isn't dying to carriers Not really. He's losing to a ground army In ground armies, we know how to deal with We can build lurkers We could play Brutlord Corruptor against this But perhaps we shouldn't be playing microbial shroud against the ground army loco I am not sure what this microbial shroud is But God, I'd love to hear what this was for Sometimes you see Tossus storm their own units This is like Loco thinking it's a fungal It's like, look at this big orange fungoy I said a couple of good fungles by there It's not a bad fight It's not a bad fight Some debatable decisions, but not a bad fight I can kind of dig it Now, there's a lot of storm here. We have a lot more hydras on the way Because 36 hydras wasn't enough yet for a loco He's like, I see there's about 35 storms left Is there any way I could play into my opponent's hand more? Yes, he tells himself as he presses down the hydra key for the next five minutes loses the hatchery literally just get stormed please note that these carriers aren't actually doing that much these carriers are not the ones dealing the main damage do not forget that this is not a loss against airtos this is a game against ground with three support six supporting carriers seven supporting carriers that wasn't really the issue now loco kind of has been building up this entire bank all game long. So for the past eight minutes he's been building this bank Now that he needs to spend it, he's lacking some larva because he's about to lose absolutely everything And maybe some static defense would have been wise to, if you ever lose a fight with your invincible composition, that perhaps you would be able to delay your opponent a little bit We just see him die to storm This guy's just bummered What is actually? Oh, loco Oh, loco Oh, loco Oh, loco Loco, loco, loco We could talk for a very long time here, loco About how, sure, you had good creeps rat And yes, you took many bases And sure, the opponent. perhaps didn't play as beautiful as you did, but your opponent also didn't walk into the same choke three times with ultras Your opponent also didn't try to counter immortals with ultras Your opponent didn't think that 47 hydras was a good call against 12 Templar So that can only lead me to one conclusion, Loco So basically Loco, what I'm trying to tell you is that Hey, what is this? Let me answer this Hello, who is this? Hello What's up, idiot? Rainer? Yeah, it's me What the hell was this? Well, I mean, it's just a replay with Loco I mean, the late game doesn't look that bad I mean, sure, Loco played well, but the Tos also did some nice moves. The late game isn't that favored for Tos, right? What do you mean? That was super one-sided Loco did everything he could He was clean, 100% I couldn't do any better Like, this was great Tos late game is absolutely nuts I was just about to tell Loco that he sucked Like, what's wrong with you? This is my show Piss off Just leave, man What the hell? What do you mean? He sucks Just leave This is my show now I'm supposed to go? Yeah, just leave What the hell? I told you, it's my show Leave Just leave, man Leave What's up, guys? Like, I'm here to tell you, Loco That was completely imbalanced I get you 100% I couldn't see that. Like, my eyes are bleeding Like you did everything you could Good job, loco Protos is just broken Hello? You hear Kevin? He actually left guys So yeah, I was telling you, like, yeah, he did everything he could, honestly Like, I feel him 100% Like, since the late game buffs and everything and the Zergnerves, this is completely one-sided Like, Loco, you're a beast Don't worry about the comments, man You got it Hello guys, don't forget to like, subscribe and yeah, just whine a bit more so maybe we get one guy at Blizzard to buff us a bit Yeah, it's a bit sad honestly See you guys, subscribe."

        "text": "Hi, Harstam Thank you for picking this replay I'd like to issue a formal complaint about two base terrans, specifically against the composition that the user Quackan, Mann, used in my recent letter match on 1115am, January 19th, 2021 on the lettermap Death Houra in gold MMR on the NA server Metafax Marines, marauders, siege tanks and SCVs were all he made In the attached replay, I had far superior economy, 7 bases to 2 And although I lost, I had more economy than the terran throughout the entire game, with a more army supply, and yet I still lost. I had an unit composition that was supposed to counter this imba composition using storms, and even Bill DTs to abuse the fact that he was on two bases, and therefore should be lacking scans I do admit that I am terrible at the game and wasn't using the full extent of my income and getting supplied blocks several times, but there should be no scenario I should lose to a player who mines out two bases, stays on 30 SUV, flows his main for three minutes straight with no threat inside it, or making as many men mistakes is this guy I even sent several waves of harassment charlesles. And I would have won the game around the 22 minute mark where my charlors kill his third, which he built 15 minutes into the game and proceed to destroy the supply deep bow at his natural Then kill it and all the SUV Then he defends zealous with SUVs by repairing his buildings Had he not used his unbalanced mechanic, I would have won the game there At that point, he has 165 minutes Yeah, right We get it I sincerely thank you for your hell That's like, this guy wrote a freaking book, what the hell, dude It's a small form This is supposed to be a 25 second second You're ruining my show. Basically, he thinks Taryn is imbalanced because he lost the Taron while he was seven base while his opponent was two days Now he had these situations before where people tell me, hey Kevin, I was on seven base and my opponent only on two And then I watched the replay and they were like on three. and a half basis and their opponent was on three and then they're surprised oh i didn't win this game well yeah you weren't actually that far ahead so we'll see if this is going to be any different now let's keep in mind this is cold leak mmr okay um so it's not going to be the tightest game most likely but it still will be fun to to have a look exactly what goes down uh down here in the in the underground the caves the caves of the caves are necessarily on the ground the tunnels That's where they sit, the gold players Way under where the normal people walk Um, starts pretty normal, honestly Gate at the ramp is not necessary. This is something I see a lot with people that, um, they've heard about walling, but they're not sure in what matchup and how to do it So just kind of always build a gate at the ramp, which is not very useful in PVT and PVZ. PVZ, obviously you wall downstairs, pvP you well upstairs, but with two, gateways and pvt you either wall the Reaper ramp you go downstairs or just put it right next to your mineral line it's playing a build order though which is nice to see so it's gonna be going 16 gate 20 Nexus which is actually a very standard build order like it's just gonna be your your normal one gate expand the opponent is doing a build order that well I am not completely familiar bit but maybe this is is something new Timings look relatively tight on the factory so I'm not going to complain Nexus, Cybercor Yeah, that Krono isn't supposed to be there because you need a simulator and pylon. Otherwise you're just going to get supply blocked, which is exactly what's going to happen at this point. He also forgets his, wait what? This is the one, this is the guy who they watched one of my videos before with a build order and after a minute and a half they went I think I got the grasp of this I think I think I can play this how hard can this really be and then they followed up by getting supply block for 25 seconds and adding a second gate before he gets his first units from his initial gateway I don't know what this is, but dang, am I looking forward to this game right now? Um, okay, the reason I laugh is because I already know the timing on these gates means it's never going to be used before warp gate. None of these gates Maybe one of them will build like a unit Maybe he'll build one unit each Um, but it's completely useless to get the gates this early This money could have been invested in something useful and nice like faster probes, faster tech Because pre-warp gate, your gateway two and three should never really be building anything You can just do that from a single gate All your gateway units in this matchup can just come initially from a single gate The opponent is forgetting to build a reactor, but we can live with that Okay, look, this second unit here could have just been built from the first gate if he started building units immediately But instead he's doing like this weird staggered pattern. I can get four gateway units out out of a single gateway, three warpgate, and my warp gate would be finishing at around this point, like 350 So he's already laid with warp gate and he's going to get the exact same amount of units, which just means what he's doing sucks I like the batteries here Actually, he scouts, hey, there's no natural yet Why would I get a third base now? Why would it continue with anything else? I want batteries I'm probably going to be under attack soon I think that's 100% the correct call I'm pretty happy with that This opponent is playing a game of the Flores Lava and loads everything up in this Metavac Just drops into the Netra. I mean this should never really work It's just not enough units There's batteries here Can even use a super battery if he wants to on one of these two There we go He's not going to even lose any real and any real HP It's just going to be shields for now A little bit of a supply block but honestly in my mind this game is completely over at this point We're now at the stage in the game where if this was me against any player in the world, I'd be comfortable to call this game 100% win for me Like, the tosses up 20 supply, or 20 workers. You have batteries for gas against a guy that is on two barracks, no stim, no tech lab He does have plus one for four Marines That's got to be one of the more useless grades I've seen But yeah, this is just really, really good for the Protos right now And all you need to do at this point as a toss is probably just get charged, Blink is also fine, and then just get a bunch of gates, continue building units, and I don't really see a way for you to lose, honestly But our man, Aristol might be making some interesting plays So what's his scouting info? Okay. He lost his probe at some point and then he decided that scouting is it's pretty much for losers at this point he's just gonna sit back get a third base extra gases going he's on what three gateways two forges templar archives i wouldn't mind if he adds like three gateways here starts his one one upgrades and throws down a couple of krona boost on this on this twilight council he's literally doubling his opponent's worker count i have a feeling he might not have been lying about the seven against two base God that would be something Okay, the other guys playing what four racks? Tank upgrades, okay I love a tank position here very far to the front. Kind of like a campaign, you know, truly like an outpost Not great but just give me that campaign feeling No fourth base yet No real scouting either still by Aristotle He's completely blind about what's going on He's absolutely zero idea No clue about the unit composition In theory, he doesn't even really know he spawned here If he didn't know the map well, he could probably think that the base is here I guess he did see something come down here, but he's absolutely zero info, which is fantastic He's getting storm as well It's not bad Adding extra gateways It's not bad Spending his money It's not bad Still double work account as well It's also not bad Not bad. Dark shrine? Okay, this is the dark shrine because he knows knows his opponent is on two base I feel like this is just one of those things he says, you know, he's just trying to justify it any way possible It's like, I build a dark shrine because he's on two base and I could force out scans Then if he's behind in a game, it's I build a dark frame because I was behind And if he's a hat in the game, oh, I build a dark frame because I'm a hat, so I thought it might be difficult for him to get detection If the game is completely even, it's like, well, I thought I wanted to get an edge. So I got some Dark Templars This is how it starts, you know, and I don't can we use some spells No feedbacks Storm wasn't done yet Yes, there we go It took his time, a double drop doing slightly more than I expected it to Because half of his army was just kind of standing around Now this is going to be a cleanup and let's have a gate count six gateways I need like one more unit here No, never mind Probes around also fine Fourth base on the way Fourteen hundred minerals in the bank Could just add like two gateways It's getting charged, which I like Should start his two too as well This guy's actually playing the floor is lava Look at. He just picks up everything I don't think he's actually touched the floor once yet He's like he's the ultimate dropper Like the multitasking Terran, you know? All of his units always in Metafx What's her? Arisol Warps in at a slow pilot 3DTs There's a bunch of units here There's defending this general area To be fair, I don't even really mind that he's defending this Look at this Because he has absolutely zero clue as what's going on He should be splitting his units Like I can't make fun of him trying to split his units I can make fun of him for the complete lack of vision on the map whatsoever He knows absolutely zero There could be 10 drops coming here. It could be a drop here, a main army here I mean, literally every spot is a viable attack path And Aramn Aristall has none of them covered Just none He probably thinks it's too much work to actually scout for what's going on You know when he's like, well, if I have one weak spot, it might be better to just have weak spots everywhere Otherwise, that week spot, that single week spot would just get abused But now I have 10 different weekspots, so they can all get abused at the same time That just doesn't make a lot of sense That just doesn't make a lot of sense I don't like that at all Marine's Marathon. Worker pull, not really a luxury, more a necessity in this situation Finally comes in action, but only with the DTs The Stalkers and the Adept still holding guard over this general area, very important DTs get scanned out, loses a base to four Marines and two Marauders This is truly something else He hasn't used a single How many High Templars has he lost? He lost five High Templars I don't think I've seen a single spell yet No feedback, no storm from Zoun Nothing I meant Clem still chilling on a solid two basis I'm loving it DTs starting to move forward as well It's going to do nothing It's going to lose all DTs. So this is why usually you send in one DT at a time to ensure that it's safe it's safe That was something else This entire game so far has been surprise after surprise We're once again up to three bases as Aristol, 66 workers against I don't understand how his army supply is consistently lower than his opponent, even though his income is literally double the entire game Still these units haven't touched the ground yet I don't think they actually fly straight into the main base This is the Artosis Pylon of Artosis Pilons, by the way Boom! Goes down How many gateways is this? Eight gateways unpowered Well, these two weren't yet powered Response is to pull the zealots, obviously. I doubt these units are ever going to participate Maybe getting a couple of stalkers would be nice so you can shoot the metaphax as well He's not actually gonna do this is he? We're not actually gonna watch this Benny Hill City to win. This guy is like the dog, you know, where you have your, you have your ball and you go like this and then you hide the ball behind your back dogs after you do it once or twice will realize aha the ball is behind the back my man Aristol has no clue he's still looking for that ball to this day like where is it if the same thing happens again I'm gonna be so pissed he left some units okay good he left some freaking units just goes back home you know what I don't need to drop in this After the blasted, this is why you just get a couple of stalkers He even has blink Five stalkers would completely destroy it. He's getting three nexite at the same time Nexus I mean, his opponent is still completely dead His opponent is literally down like 1K in bank at this point, down 1 2K in income Same upgrades Smaller army there is nothing here that is looking good for the terran there's nothing not a single thing here is good for the terran I can't see it at least on vehicle plating the triple Nexus experiment like I have no clue what I'm watching here you could also start a 3 3 couldn't you know usually if I see one more slow warp and I'm actually going to lose it So if a pylon is closed by in Nexus, it provides a quick warp in which takes like three seconds. If the pylon is not nearby in access or not connected to a nexus, it does the slow warpins And so far I've really only seen slow warpins He's actually up 20 supply It's or 20 army supply and like double the worker supply still Kills the third base I think this is what he was talking about. Our main man still floor is lava quack qua man come buddy keep going dude we're cheering hard for him did it did it did it the only vision that aristol has is in nexai like he can also just spread out units but instead he uses he uses nexai as a way to scout like these bases are not meant for mining they're just meant as scouting he's like man it's really difficult for for tops to get any type of vision on the map With Terran, I just used to use sensor towers Oh, he did say he used to be a Terran main, by the way, in the description I can't remember if I mentioned that because it was so freaking long. Maybe he thinks if you get nexus, nexai, you're going to be capable of scanning like you are with Terran So that's why he's using that as a way of vision Like, just use your entire I don't think he has any control groups at all He's probably looking around the map for units to drag select and then right click into the opponent's army Like, just build a couple of stalkers please Yes, stalkers Oh, these guys have been here for a long time How long will this last? Okay, storms, that's good Feedback, maybe Like, what's he controlling? It's not a good storm actually His storms have been on point I mean, so far he's only lost what? Five high templars. we've already seen two good storms He's still so far up He's legit floating 3K resources Like, at any point, if he decides to spend half of his money, get any upgrades, any type of map, this is the first time we're moving out He just insta wins, Aristotle He is legit on six base against two base He's up, 50 supply, and all of that is workers But he has so much, what's the gateway? He has 12 gates He could literally just warp in and be maxed, basically This is a decoy base It's not a re You think this is the charge slot harass he was talking about. If this is the charge-slother, I have, I'm just constantly stunned by the things, I'm trying to connect them back to the email, right? It's like, this makes just no sense at all This is not charge-lother-ass This, it's just sacrifice Sacrifice to the Terran gods Five DTs come in This Terran's been good at scanning so far, and as I say that, of course, he's going to lose every single tank for free It does end up scanning There's just no unit control So I have a couple of working theories here First of all, I think we might have a player here who doesn't actually use hotkeys I think he just literally drag selects whatever units he needs This has never moved. So whenever he warps something in, he immediately kind of selects it, right? Because it's easy And then he'll just click it in or something like that that what is a first person from someone like this look like like there's a scan you see a lot of army I mean continue right clicking the tank he sees the zealots here look at this the zealots he's like well I am in trouble but these zealots are kind of defending the left side right now Maybe he's just a role player, you know? Just wants to defend the castle on the left side with this group He cares more about the role play than he cares about winning this game. But then why would he send in the email? I do believe he's an actual role, he's larping right now The actual role player live here on IOTIS Alright, he kills the attack, the DTs did their job, but now he's only on four bases He only has double the worker count He's only mining three, four hundred minerals more than his opponent Like, these are all things that are an issue Sure, if we look at the, at the grand scheme of things, he's still light years ahead But this guy doesn't need to be light years ahead Like, this guy just needs to be in a completely different dimension if he wants to win a game Like, he is so insanely bad He just doesn't fight. He just keeps using DTs again and again and again He's 3K in the bank He has 12 gateways He could spend that twice and he'd be up like he had double the army supply He would have double, literally double the army supply Right here he's owning the taron with a single DT again There's no matterfax here by the way This is an army without Metafx Where's the rest of the army? It's all spread out That's the issue I have Okay, the initial salad sacrifice You think he's going to realize his units here? Like, I just don't know what he's You just keep standing in single DTs He didn't build a dark shrine because he thought his opponent wasn't going to have scans. He built a dark shrine because in his eyes, zealots are useless But that's because he keeps sending in like squats of 20 zealads Sir, we have enough to surround our enemy We're outnumbering his forces, 10 to 1 How do you want to continue here? Mementa Ristel goes, send in five at a time Make sure that the opponent can rest in between waves This is actually how it goes in the campaign and in cold up Aristol is an actual AI Like he's just sending in waves of units I'm surprised he doesn't, like, there's no pop-up coming on Quequamon stream Amon is sending more units to our base How are we going to be defending this? Like, that's the only thing missing here for Arista. It's just the warning that he's feeding him 10 more salads And this is not the campaign on Bruton, my friends he he is the normal he's the normal campaign this is not even hard it's maybe even casual he might actually be the casual campaign just almost got a storm up oh got another storm i have no clue what happened here but he has 21 workers left 3K in the bank and he's down in army supply If this base burns down, I'm gonna be so extremely sad, you won't even believe it Okay, this arm this looks bad, okay? But in reality he's still on four neck size so he can very rapidly produce more unit or more workers He has a completely fresh base. He stills mining a bit here He has 3K in the bank He never got any upgrades past 2, too, by the way I love that he's like, you know what? I have 18 workers My priority is going to be to get another base to really split those workers Like, this just makes me sad, honestly He stands in a DT again If I see one more DT go in to clean something up that your freaking army of 35 zealots could also do Why is he expanding to four different bases at the same time? How about we saturate the one base that we already have? He's like the guy always aiming for more, but never truly using what he already has. He's the ultimate consumer, Aristotel Like 17 different purses, doesn't use a single one of them Oh, that's a nice new purse, let me get that one Uses it once It just doesn't match my other outfits Gets a new purse, except the purses are bases There's no such thing as an outfit in Stark He actually kills this base Use all of his units to kill an opponent base Now, let me give him some Starcraft theory here If you are up to two mining bases, okay, and you have 26 workers, and your opponent has nine workers and has basically half a mining base, what you can do is nothing You can just sit back and do nothing. You're actively winning the game by doing nothing, okay? What you can also do is send 25 zealots across the map and then lose every mining base you've ever had to 10 Marines and 8 Metavax That's also possible Now if these were two options in a quiz, this is celebration time These two adepts and stalker, they've been here for about 20, well, about 15 minutes, I think This is the first time they moved Just to be sacrificed to the gods It's just sad Another successful engagement? He is looking at this, right? Because where else is he looking? I don't understand how that is possible. How is it possible that you can be looking at something and not wanting to change if the fight is looking so terrible he's gonna probably get the CC as well you think he knows how to recall I don't think so I don't think we're gonna see a recall I'd love to though he actually might be losing at this point and I know that sounds dumb because he still double the opponent supply but he just he just lost I think three bases to six or seven six or seven Marines He gave up For a second I was going to be afraid He was actually just going to keep attacking the wall again and again and again until he lost every single salad. But no, he sends them back Warps in a DT There's full scanning Full scanning possibility at this point Okay, so what really is there left? Let's Let's quickly make Let's quickly make, evaluate the situation Okay, so we have 16 Marines, one tank, one Templar, 20 zealads, 3DTs, two stalkers He could split his army and win on both sides, okay? That is important here It's important to realize that he could split his army and win on both sides. Like probably without even microing, all he would need to do, would need to do is just a move that's literally all he would need to do I I okay riddle me this why do this why do people do this I don't mind Play like this, okay? Power to you If this is your type of game, that's completely fine I don't give a crap But why do you feel the need to send this to me? Honestly, what am I supposed to say here? Like, what even was this? Like, what is this? You queued it up from here It walks all the way over there to cast a storm eight seconds late There's no upgrades or there's no There's no control groups. You forgot to upgrade for 15 minutes Like, what do you expect me to do here? I just don't understand why I get this Like, your double supply Why don't you just aim move? He's still winning so hard, that's the worst part He's like light years ahead and I know he's gonna lose this somehow I think I could legit win this game with my eyes closed And my opponent would be beyond, like, all you need to do is find the F2 button and you can just aim on the mini map and you'll win It's not actually possible to lose this game. It's also absolutely fantastic that the first time he starts spreading out his units is by the time that all he needs to do is defend his base I feel like this would be the perfect replay If you have a just any type of player, it doesn't matter if you're new or old It's like if you really want to know what you want to do in a game, you just watch this game and do the exact opposite every single action he makes Like just every single action do the complete opposite opposite Because holy crap this is awful I love to stare him by the way Like his passion for dropping is truly showing It's something I can appreciate This man just has one passion. That's to load up the units and then drop them again and load them up and just to drop them again Okay this move Okay, this actually does it for me I'm not sure if I want to finish it Just appreciate the brilliance here, okay? I'm going to actually take an alternative angle He is being dropped His army consists of mainly zealots And his response is, is to build a pylon here to ensure that the zealots go in one by one, rather than five at a time Look at this He creates a choke for himself because he didn't think the game would be hard enough if that choke wasn't there This is beautiful. Did you sacrifice his Templar? He actually doesn't mean he's actually winning this fight I think he just sacrifices his Templar This is something else We're in Nexus Into the nose, out through the mouth Holy crap My blood pressure is actually insane right now Like this is not good for me guys Like this is shaving years of my life, this single game This should come with like a warning with a warning like cigarettes, you know? Smoking kills Like Aristol is going to be the biggest killer There's going to be like one of these big researchers in like different populations And people who were subscribed to my YouTube channel will just die 15 years earlier All because of this single game game. This is actually, I don't even know how, I'm going to do the responsible thing At the end of this video, after everything is said and done, I'll give all of you guys a two and a half minute meditational exercise, okay? We'll just do it together Let me make sure that, you know, we can get back to normal levels Normal normal levels Normal levels in her head, her brain doesn't explode Our heart doesn't start pounding so fast out of frustration that it might actually burn a hole in our chest. Okay, if we once again honestly evaluate this position, we have Quequaman who is mining zero Okay, we have an income of zero We have Aristotel who has an income of one. thousand which means every minute this game last he's gonna get ten zealots okay that's the theory here well if he would repower these gates versus units oh he still has some spread out this is great all he needs to do is defend this base okay if this base stays alive he actually can't lose it's not possible Well, in theory it's not possible So far, Aristotel has been showing me again and again that it completely is possible How about we build a pilot? What is he doing? I'm just so curious. You know what I really need right now? more workers because I have a single mining base how is this to play he's seeing that there's no expansions of his opponent he's actively realizing that you have vision everywhere at this one how is the play here to build two more next eye it's like his opponent is on his last legs like this is it you know all you need to do is not die and you're gonna be you're actually just win the game and what does he do just builds two more next eye just built some pilots please i still have absolutely no clue how he's going to lose this game he could he could he could literally aim of his opponent at this point as well don't forget the army supply looks big for the terran but it's nine meta facts he has seven marines and one tank against ten times 45 workers he's so oversaturated okay this is once again a warning nexus this is the nexus that says hey you need to move to the right side to defend it right now How does he not have any money? Where's the money going to? Just more probes? How is that the thing that he really needs right now? He's going to have two mining bases. He has 45 workers He's massively oversaturated here He's long-distance mining He pulls the probes That's something He's actually losing this game He's actually unironically losing this game I just can't believe it I just actually can't believe it It's getting dropped again It's getting dropped again I'd be going bananas if I was arrested at this point. I just don't I have no worse for this he's not even losing still by the way like it's actually still playable he can just get Templar if he gets two Templar out who he warped something in two stalkers where did he warp them in over here smart get a pile on here but I'm just gonna follow him right now what is the play here is he attacking He's a zealots, he's a zealotness and I won't need that Stalkers? Just doing a small attack I'm gonna still leave like four He's 48 workers against four 50 workers against four How many workers died this game? Holy crap Oh god What is the units lost? He just He just isn't looking He's an ostrich. If I don't see it happening, it's not happening He's an actual ostrich So far, he's been an AI, an ostrich I feel like I called him another thing as well, but I can't remember what This is pure insanity This is what pure insanity is like It just starts expanding to the right side He's actually lost the game at this moment Right now, the game is actually over He actually lost It's Marines in the main base? I can't believe this I don't think I've ever seen this in a PVT before in my life Because aim moving is going to get you better ratio Like actually, it's just not possible I just never seen it Let's just be this part up a bit. Oh, here we go, final fight That's it, he has no units The thing is, he doesn't know that he has no units, because he never has them hotkeyed anyway What? He's getting a Stargate? Probably in the probably you know what what the issue here is is the drops the drops is the issue that's really what got me not the trace it's the drops the drops got me good oh my god you gotta be kidding you actually got to be kidding he's building a Stargate 35 minutes in the game after being completely abused by drops for the past 25 minutes of this game. Actually, ever since the start, the first attack, don't forget, he had four minutes with like four marines in a tank and a Meredevac dropping over here I remember Do you remember? Actually mining again He has no clue that he lost He's still looking around the map for units, but he can't find them What actually is he doing at this one? Gigi That's it Holy freaking crap dude Holy crap My friend said I should have built things that shut up and killed his Menevex, as he had no gas But I built stalkers and high templars with storm and still lost the fight. Even though I wasn't able to defend my bases properly, I had so much more banked than him that I thought I would win for sure Okay, even though I wasn't able to defend my bases properly, this sounds like there was a reason why he couldn't defend his basis That's not what happened, okay? What happened was, is he didn't defend his basis properly This is like when your teacher asked you why I didn't do your homework and you go, I wasn't able to do my homework And then the guy goes, why not? Like, did something bad happen? Like, were you sick? And I was like, no, I just wasn't able to do it Like, I didn't sit down and I didn't do it. I guess that's different You know, he's trying to trick us through language But you're not tricking us, my friend I almost managed to finish elementary school I know how to read I had so much more bank than him I thought I would win for sure I'm new to pro-tos as I was previously a Terran main My friend, I don't like giving this advice, but honestly, it might just be best if you go back to Terran Like, there's no future for you in this race or perhaps in this game in general Like, I love you platonically, but this is not it This just is not it Whatever you do, just enjoy the game by yourself, but don't ever, ever send me a replay again. I will fly over to where you live I will find you And it won't be fun You suck And you suck really hard That's going to be it for today Don't forget to subscribe and like Get ready for the meditation Become comfortable in your chair or your cushion Perhaps loosening any tight clothing Removing your glasses and watch if that is appropriate Settling in with a relaxed but erect posture, straight but relaxed Shoulders relaxed Noticing your sit bones on the chair or cool cushion, finding a balance between your sit bones, equal pressure, centered and balanced. Settling in here now, relaxing, perhaps moving your upper body slightly forward, then slightly back to find that balanced place in the middle, with no stress on your lower back from being too far forward and no tension in your abdomen from leaning too far back that's centered, balanced, natural posture, allowing your arms and hands to rest comfortably in your lap, gently closing your eyes now, or if you prefer casting your gaze downwards to the floor, a bit ahead of you, not really looking at anything, rather partially closing your eyelids, and looking gently with a soft gaze, neutral, relaxed. allowing your body to become still now as you focus your attention inward your shoulders chest and stomach all relaxing bringing your awareness now to the breath not controlling or manipulating the breath in any way but noticing your breath as it enters through your nose and moves all the way down to your belly and back out again one breath following the other the in-bread and the out breath, following Noticing how each breath follows one after the other in a never-ending cycle and flow, letting everything else move into the background, allowing the breath be the focus of your awareness No need to think about how the air moves in and out, just being with the breath, allowing the breath to breathe itself. Now, allowing your awareness to rest on the path of the breath that is the most natural and comfortable for you Might be at the tip of the nose, noticing that the air is cooler on the in-breath and warmer on the out-breath It might be in the throat area as you feel the breath move through this channel to support your entire body Don't forget to smash like on this channel as you breathe out as you breathe out Hit the subscribe button And don't forget to tell all your friends about it That's going to be it for today I hope you're all calm, ready to take on your day And thanks everyone for watching Thank you, Aristotle, for sending in the replay. You made me a stronger human by being capable of controlling my own emotions in the face of pure idiocy I do appreciate you I see you all next time for a new IOTUS, a new video Bye-bye."

        "text": "Hi, Harstam I'm a big fan of yours TVZ I feel very unfair I've been preventing him from developing fungal carpet tumors My evil fire also burned a lot of fungal carpets After the first attack, I went back to gather troops to fight the second attack I played a double line I knocked out one of his bases, although the main force of the other half was gone It changed almost the same However, his soldiers made up too fast and I couldn't stop it at all It's unfair If it is my problem, please teach me how to face these things I absolutely have zero idea what you just said None I don't even know what matchup. Well, you said TVZ after saying I'm a big fan of yours, comma TVZ And then period I feel very unfair I just kind of want to reject this one already Hamster Wrap it up Poop You suck I was kidding All right I guess what he's saying is let's just try to decipher this message for a bit I think what he means is that my evil fire is probably Hallions So Helians managed to burn a lot of creep tumors After his first attack, he went back to gather up more forces for a second attack He played a double line He multitasked He knocked out one of his bases Well, that was pretty obvious Although the main force of the other half was gone. I guess the other half is his opponent it changed almost the same probably means it changed nothing his soldiers remaxed too fast and he couldn't stop it at all so I guess the problem is that his opponent can remix too fast and produce too quickly got sent in from the Chinese server a master's player he has a name that oh I do not read Chinese so I can I don't know what it says 4 2k MMR it's gonna be on death aura and it's gonna be One hell of a replay I can feel it already. In the bottom left we have our man, well the subject, our terran player, the man who is here with the evil fire, trying to destroy the fungle carpet, tumours The red terran All right, in the bottom right we have IG Zau, which is the Zerk for today I'm curious to see what we have I'm really, I'm looking forward to this The Chinese replays, not only do they always have great descriptions They tend to be very very, very good The Chinese server is a server that I, you know, I'd like to get a closer look at at times because these guys, they know how to play. It's of course not weird as one of the greatest military strategist of all time comes out of China Sun Tzu is a world famous book, The Art of War, appear weak when you're strong, appear strong when you are weak. And loads of other, you know solid solid words of advice can be applied to starcraft let's see if our terran friend also read the art of war or if you read the art of sucking which also is an interesting book do not buy that if you're below 18 um barracks uh i think this was a barracks first barracks first yeah barracks first depot and we have just a standard hatch first on the other side of the map so looking pretty solid here for opener wise you know just just your your your standard openers for for both players i don't mind this there's no s evi v scout but you don't need the s evi v scout every single game i'm not going to complain about not s evi scouting you know it's just the decision you make you want more money you don't as a v scout you know good for you i'm not going to complain about that if you like cash if you like the money you like a little bit of risk yeah don't siv scout you know where I'm not gonna blame you for that. You know, I don't probe scout half of my games It's just to show some dominance, showing that you're not afraid I think that's a good play, it's a good play See what it's gonna do with the Reapers? Even gonna keep the Reaper, is he gonna keep it at home? We're just gonna straight across the map Straight across the map No half-mashers here She's gonna bang Bang it out and then move I like that I do like that Doesn't take the speed zones You know, this guy just wants to take the long way around to bottle with it bottle whiskey for the way He doesn't even need no sweet company and he's he's living today, leaving today. What do you say? And his Reaper's not gonna be gone, hopefully, um, throws a grenade, gets a drone That's a good start That's a good start I like this I like this Um, starts attacking the links as well and pisses up Now this is a good start Not very often do you see people get a drone Follow up at home is second gas factory, barracks as well and orbital finishing up Reaper takes out a creep tumor as well What is this? Creep tumor and a drone? This is a very valuable Reaper over here Look at this guy It's the MVP so far of this game It's looking healthy as well He's healing up over here by himself in the corner. One HP every half a second or something like that It's going to go in for the second tumor most likely Look at him Oh, he sees it go down He sees it go down He sees it Whop Right clicks it Throw the grenade. takes the tumor loses his life not quite worth it of course but I mean he did a good job you know you you take a risk you know this guy he likes taking risk you know we we can see that already we can see that this this Terran players is not he's not a scare he's not a scared one he when he when he goes to an amusement park he goes into all the roller coasters you know he's he likes to live on the edge for Depot is a little bit too quick fifth Po is way too quick 46 out of 62 is not quite what you need, but I mean it's, I'm not going to, it's better than being supply blocked. You know, we've had a pro player E-Laser who was building 19 overlords at a five-minute mark so it'd never be supply block again You'd send out your first Voidre, kill four overlords and watch the replay, so he still had like 20 oversupply Like, what the hell is this? Creep tumours being thrown down, get taken out So actually a lot of the, the fungal car. is being taken out here by the evil fire as this overlord gets taken out by i guess it was this marine as well now i did spot that there was cloak banshee on the way so shouldn't be able to do too much with these individual banshees when you get spotted with cloak banshee something that i think is in general very common at the moment even if you don't get spotted but it's also just very very good is to is to save up two banshees and then go in with two at the same time because usually the spores or the here, well it's going to be sports most likely, are going to be in time for that single Benchie and you're not going to be able to do very much with that first Benji, even though it has cloak because I mean you got spotted unless the opponent actually has no brain, you shouldn't be capable of getting any real damage there. Third CC on the way, Barracks 3 and 2, 2 and 3 on the way as well. So you see 4 SCVs stay at home, 4 SCVs on the other side of the map. The Banshee flies in. It's going to get two drones for free. And then decides to take a couple of shots to the head as well. I mean, why not? Two workers, I really think saving it up would have been better here. Or just go for one worker and then run away again because I think that one worker was free damage. Now, he took so much damage here. It's going to be hard to go in later on. And once you have two Banshees, it just becomes way easier to one-shot drones. Well, it just becomes possible If you have one banshee, it's literally important possible to one shot a worker Now this benchy is doing a little bit of work still in vision range of the spore So honestly not the hottest control on these benches Yeah, just going to lose it here I guess All right, Benchie goes down, flies into spore of the spore Without overseers, you never really should be capable of losing banshees, but control not looking too hot However, the creep denial is looking pretty hot I am liking the creep denial here We see a lot of tumours going down already I think we see maybe four or five to seven tumors going down The Benji goes back in here. So this Benji is actually going to be able to do a little bit of extra damage here as well It gets what three more three more workers These Helions are still all alive as well Should be careful though Don't really want to be losing that or even tanking any damage Armory goes down Stim has to finish up already Combat Shield hasn't started yet And there's no real rally point on these Marines and tanks We see a supply drop being utilized Now all of this is honestly sure it isn't great, but it isn't the worst thing As long as eventually you do start your stim, I can kind of accept this, you know The opponent is building two macro hatches in the main. It's not too keen on injecting, it seems like Overall, I think this is not a bad situation for the Terran If I'm a Taryn here I'm gonna be pretty freaking happy we can repair our cars we can move out with a little bit of a tank boon we have two tanks and Yeah, it's just all around looking pretty freaking solid in position for the link run by Helleon control not brilliant but okay lost I think lost five aliens there at least maybe lost one before there's a lot of aliens for for against these many links yeah that's a bit painful But we're still in an okay spot, okay, first push Sure, it hits about a minute late. Sure, he completely forgot about combat shield Sure, Tutu hasn't started immediately, and he starts with armor rather than attack, which is definitely not the play So it's not perfect, okay, but no one is perfect. To be fair, the Tarrin here really is very far from perfect, but let's just give him this, okay? plus two starts up sure combat shield is should have been done already at this point and hasn't started yet over stimming hello what's this guy defending he's holding the back line in case there's a flank he will die first i don't even think they're in range of each other he's like if there's like two links attacking here this guy won't even be able to cover this tank is defending absolutely nothing he's vulnerable to everything, defends nothing Honestly, at this point, you might as well not take it. You know, this guy is just stay, if you don't want to join in on the fight, just don't show up, you know? Is the guy when there's riots against the police or something like that? He's the guy in the back, you know, just just saying things, whispering things like, I don't like, I don't like you guys, I'm rioting too Like, just stay at home Like, you don't have to be a bad guy you can do what you want The perfect spot for you is right over here, you know, maybe even a bit further to the back. So whenever this area, when there's links over here, you can do some work, but don't pretend, don't join the forces, you know, like you don't want to be sent out, just go home This tank is completely useless, okay? It should be over here or maybe even a bit over here It kind of covers the front line, covers these Marines, covers this tank Actually can maybe shoot at a potential flank this is pathetic So you have these marines who are heavy, heavy stim addicts, completely overstimed Single bainling would be able to take all of them out Luckily here, for our Terran player, it hasn't happened Kills a lot of creep tumors though, only loses a single tank. And if he packs up now and takes this bad boy with him, I'm not even going to complain too much about this You know, this wasn't a great fight, but he cleared a bit of creep He only lost a single tank You can just pack up, go home Fort CC on the way, second factory on the way as well And he decided, you know what, perhaps getting those shields on my Marines isn't too bad because I keep stimming again and again and again And I kind of would like them to be able to tank a bailing shot at some point in their life So, yeah, I do like that a lot Second factory on the way. Honestly, the theory behind this is all proper, right? You're going to be playing five racks into double factory, Ford CC, two to upgrade What is This barracks musicianing But you know what's possible? Is there a setting in StarCraft? Okay, I'm going to show you guys this setting The setting is the, where is that? The mouse and keyboard is the mouse scroll speed I think this guy has the scroll speed all the way to a hundred And whenever he touches the edges, it just flies across the map. And so what happens is he goes into one of his bases, right? He goes over here, it's like, okay, selects his worker, clicks the build button, has the barracks, and actually goes over here, and he's like, oh, barracks over here, because his building positioning is just, this is not SimCity Like, if this guy was a city planner, the hospital would be like 15 kilometers away from the city center because his mouse just went like this to the corner of the map again and again Like, there's absolutely no logic Like, this CC, what is this CC? And usually you build it over here Second factory is supposed to be over here Like you build your first barracks. This is the only building that is in the correct position And the eBay's, I guess I'm surprised that he managed to land to see Cs in the correct spot Because holy crap, this guy has absolutely no clue of any type of city planning Please, I hope to God for the future of China This man is never going to get a job as a potential city planner. that would not be good it's actually so this is the double line he was talking about um we have that that that little bit of multitasking he's doing a good job honestly even even without combat shield he's picking stuff up he's he's relatively quick i think at least yeah he's he's fast you know 300 apm as a turn that's not bad at all and we have some some un some unseached shenanigans here he's going to seat them all in the same spot not a big fan of this against ravagers because Biles can usually kind of, well, if the Zerg would decide the bile, could do something about that. Half of the Marine Force is very focused on taking out these extractors while the rest of the army is being taken out I guess the main priority here was ensuring that this hatchery almost goes down Does take out this hatchery? I like that he shut down an extractor, half an extractor, like 90% of this hatchery as well So you always got to kind of imagine in these scenarios is what would happen if that DPS was focused on the units, okay? So if you have a ravager, that's what, like 120, 120 HP, right? Yeah, 120 HP on a ravager This hatchery is like 1,500 He just basically, he focused like nine ravagers down, but instead he almost got a hatchery. And same with this extractor Like, this extractor tends to like, I think it's 500 HP, right? Yeah, 500 HP He killed one The other one is halfway down That's another three, four ravagers He probably would have just straight up won the fight Now, it's still not bad because he took out the base He has his own fourth base His worker production has been a bit mediocre, but he has a good seeded up position here that should never be capable of being broken I mean, he's up like 20 army supply He has two-two upgrades, three-three on the way I'm completely happy with this He seized the move out from his opponent. He decides to counterattack and then you just kind of defend your seats position Or you move out on the map with all of your units unseached into banlings after you spot what's happening He loses half of his army He's like, hey, I think I can give you the other half as well Yeah, he's kind of right about that He's giving the other half of his army He literally just lost 60 army supply for absolutely no reason This absolutely makes no sense This absolutely makes no sense. This made no sense you know what I think happened here I feel like he's once done this before you know this this fight that he did over here just now he's had this before and he won it and this is kind of what we call a dumb decision okay and this is based on on the prior prior experience and I think this actually called the survivor survivor bias so what happens is people that have something good happen to them or or or or they just survive in general that's why it's called survivor bias they think that every decision did they that led up to that good thing was a good decision because the outcome was good right but that's not true and I'm gonna illustrate that with an analogy imagine your you're into stocks okay and in order to decide what stock you're going to take, what you do is you go to your local zoo, you start taunting the monkeys until they throw poop at you, and then you calculate the speed of the poop. And based on the speed of the poop slung at you by the monkeys in your local zoo, with a formula, you decide which stock to pick And you pick a stock that rises a lot And you go, see, the method works But that's not quite how it works, my friend Like, everything leading up to your decision was incorrect The fact that you got the correct outcome doesn't necessarily mean that the process going towards that decision was correct And that's what you did here You already had this happen before, but in reality, you just had some monkeys throw poop at you And that's not the proper way to play StarCraft So I had to go very deep for that one. planetary fortress on the fourth base i do like that even even though that fight was god-awful the situation still is somewhat manageable the creep isn't great really he truly has been doing a great job at at kind of clearing creep in the early game there's only four bases for this point he does the same thing again but is he keep moving into the open space the siege his tank he's like i like defensive jokes but you know it'd be better if the zircurgi just surround me and all of his units would be useful It's very inclusive, I have to admit, our good Terran friend over here, but not really the proper way to play. He's going to end of losing this planetary, but the Zerk is going to pay a big and hefty fine for that in losing his entire army And honestly, they're both kind of throwing the game onto each other Like if I wouldn't be surprised if either of these guys was baseball players, because they're extremely good at throwing We have 3-3 about to finish up, and now that he's won a fight, our good Chinese Terran decides it's time to move out once again 28 Marines, three marauders, three tanks as well I'm kind of a fan of this move-out, okay? If he micros this well, he could potentially do something. You know what I'd like even more? If he just loads up like two metaphics and just goes to this area or something, like that There's almost no creep on that left side And if you check, there's no fifth base over here Maybe there's a fifth base over here And four base versus four base tends to be quite beneficial for Taryn Did I lower the speed of the game? Accidentally, I think I had Yeah, nice It's going to be one hell of an episode then It's like twice as long as usual Drilling clause starts for the currently zero mines But honestly, I don't mind it either because against big Ling bane count, getting a couple of mines can be quite useful. So if he eventually throws this onto a reactor or he throws this one onto a reactor, that actually could be kind of beneficial We have a link run by We have a link bane run by being set up This Zurich is playing well as well, by the way This is not a bad game This was a master's game for a point two, but these guys are making very solid plays all the way throughout I like to see it You know, you love to see it even The only problem right now for the Tarrin here is that the Zerk is kind of outmining him This is a good position Now this is proper, well, let's ignore these two tanks on the right side. Let's pretend that didn't happen Just make my camera a bit bigger so we don't see that This fight actually wasn't too bad Sure, he lost a crap ton of workers, but the way that he did this fight, he actually stayed in a defensive position Also, okay, this is pissing off Why every single time that he sees he's being attacked? He decides now is a great time to go and deny some creep on the other side of the map. like this is fine if you're up 40 supply or you know you're going to absolutely blast a fight but if the fights are as tight as this you're going to need every single unit you can at home buddy like you're just going to need it how many workers did he lose right he only lost 25 workers which means he didn't really build that many workers overall and he's been very bad at rebuilding workers as well also his gas income is plenty you know like yes he is yeah do you think this guy just does it automatically or actually looked at his at his resource tab, it was like 2. 8k gas, huh? I think this, with my 48 SEVs, I might be going into a late game It might be best if I add two extra refineries here on the third I'm surprised he hasn't rebuilt this one yet, but I see the SUV is already ready, ready, ready and in position, ready to go There's an orbital here Wait, what? Why would he build an orbital here? He keeps getting attacked into position by Pure Ling Bain You're going to get an orbital on your furtile. base buddy that's I thought he flew over the main for a second but no that actually was that should have been a planetary so um okay he's gonna get his reactor now I like that's gonna be going into mines he's taking defensive positions all he needs is a little bit of counter attack a counter harass on the other side and he needs to increase his marauder production he built a barracks over here I like that as well actually kind of like the move this guy is is making here and these banings are are trying their absolute best to go to get to these rocks where these links are just kind of denying them that's just that's just sad that's just sad can i take the fifth base with the orbital from the main income is pretty far behind here for the terran once again one of the tanks not sieged up but zirk is uh is trying to to look for an angle is not really going to be able to find it i don't think at least i don't think he's going to be able to find it um except i guess on this fifth base but yeah there's really not much to defend tank one Once again, not siege. Hello? What are these splits? What are these splits? What are these splits? Okay, a quick tip If your opponent has Banelings, which, for the people not aware, explode on your units, the thing you don't want to do is you don't want to run forward into that You want to be running back, kiting towards your Tanks Now, not all Tanks are in position, but it's to be expected, right? You have to cover a big area here What can help is a Sensor Tower, which is practically MAPHACK, and it sees where your opponent is attacking What you don't want to do is you see the Banelings come in and then run towards them Yeah, you'll lose the fight. Like, these ultras didn't even do any damage You just literally ran into banlings Gigi. overall units lost still in favor of the terran even after those fights I think if anything my friend you might have been the broken race like okay let's let's just let's just go over this real real slow and easy okay you said you said you cleared a lot of creep that's correct you cleared a lot of creep um you took out the base that's true as well let's not forget about the about maybe 1600 damage that you put on the extractor and a three-fourth of another hatchery as well, which probably would have straight-up on you the game, the forgetting of combat shield, the initial forgetting of the plus to attack, the weird attack, you know, the monkey throwing poop at you in the middle of the map, like, I have absolutely no clue what you were doing there. You kept taking terrible fight after terrible fight, and somehow you're still up in units lost My friend, I think the issue is absolutely not with Zirk being able to reproduce so far. fast is just with you being terrible at taking fights like son too is looking at this and he's going to be real upset you're a poor military strategist and not only that my friend you also suck and that's the way it has to be sometimes all right that's going to be it for today's episode of is it imba or do I suck if you did like this episode don't forget to smash the like button on this video hit it subscribe as well as there will be more videos like this every single week on this channel and every single day there's another video of series that you guys like less and that's okay i'll see you all next time bye bye."

        "text": "Dear Harstam, in my opinion, Protos race is too forgiving There are overcharged for your battery if you aren't ready for attack Boost if you are behind in anything E dot T dot C dot In this replay I was miles ahead in every way possible, but Protos had disruptors and I couldn't do anything I tried splitting and focusing with a single S, but one or two shots kill my entire army P S , I played two games against this guy and actually won the first time, but in this game he had better disruptors the shots That's why I lost You have to admit that it is imba Name, softer, race, terran, leak, diamond, MMR 3 5 were on the EU server. The replay was saved in Cyrillic, so I'm assuming this guy is Russian Let's up straight into it We have, in the bottom right, spawning, the blue terra player We have Safter, the man, the mid, the legend, the person, in charge of sending me this replay Now I am extremely curious to see how my man Saffler is going to play this game He says he was miles ahead Miles, not just a little bit, not just even No, no, he was miles ahead And then his opponent, with the nasty Kronoboose, managed to make a comeback Now, these are some things that Terran say very often, right? You can make a comeback with Kronobo boost. But actually, the thing is, is that without Kronobo boost, Toss would always be behind because of how mules work, right? So it's not really so much to be ahead It is to be to stay even If you're behind, you're, it kind of stays the same That's at least what tends to happen The reason why TOS tends have slightly more eco is because their nexus goes down slightly faster than the Terrans most of the time So that's why they have like maybe one and a half extra worker initially People always think it's because of Corona Boost Yeah, obviously Chrono Boost helps but without Chrono Boost it really wouldn't be the case So, I'll just turn on the sound a bit of my own headset. We have my man softer scouting his opponent, sees everything and it's probably going to be too late for a block on the natural here which is interesting because his scout timing was pretty much after Depot which is some of the fastest scout timing I've seen in my life or like slightly after Depot like a 17 scout If you scout this early, you either eBay block or you steal the gas or something I don't actually know, but I've never seen it being played like this where you don't do anything with that scout Interesting start, that's for sure Now we have Reaper coming out already We see a single gas and the CC should be built relatively soon from now There comes the command center. Yep, there we go Pylon won't be able to quite block that Well, it's going to be able to block the initial location This should be a cancel on this pylon, by the way, at this point. That's uh yeah software should take out this probe I was gonna say he just runs past that that would be very sad and not very good at all All right stalker for the tost no warp gate yet what do we have here for our Terran player no second gas complete lack of workers so far Okay, it builds two at the same time a slight slight delay there on the workers okay I'm going to going to be paying a lot of attention to how quickly he will be building workers because he says he got miles ahead and then lost because of Kronobo boost very very often very often when Terrans tell me this look at their replay and they have like two command centers not building SUVs for three four minutes in the game it's like really Kronobo boost that's what they're gonna blame this on like that's definitely odd my dudes that's definitely not it but we'll see we'll see maybe the Kronobo boost you know is stronger than I imagine it to be. Or then I know it is At least I believe it is Let me see the Toss not getting any upgrades He had no warp gate Let me see Ooh, Twilight and Robo at the same time Okay, okay Techlapse trade away on this factory What happened with the Marine? Did he skip his first Marine? Did he lose it? Okay, he didn't lose anything So he skipped first Marine Oh, right, he played gas first So slightly less economical opener, but it's going to allow him to do that type of stuff Like Reaper into Reactor, fast factory It's not really using the factory right now Curious to see what he wants to use it for It's going to be a cyclone. As this pylon is being taken out, we have at least decent SDV production Two stalkers move across the map Reaper's still alive, got a single kill Is this a wall? I guess it is, right? I never actually have walled it To be fair, I veto submarine This map is awful for Protos Just terrible, terrible, terrible for Protos Prison? Okay, well, this is a builder that I'm absolutely not familiar with what the Produs is doing over here He's going to be trying to trade a little bit with those Marines, but sadly for him, the cyclone comes out Good start here for Shafter, honestly He is indeed going to be, as he said it, miles ahead. He will be able to take out at least one worker here if he decides to micro his Reaper He does decide the Micro's Reaper If he would focus fire, you'd probably be able to get like two, three here But it doesn't really seem to be the case Oh, there we go Yeah, attacks a full help one as well Now, one of my favorite things to do is when the Terrans are controlling their one Reaper, is to keep an eye on their minerals here, you know? You just want to see like, hey, what's happening with the mineral count while you're microing this Reaper? I don't think he's gone back to his base in a bit now Okay, now he's like, oh, crap. Oh, let me throw everything here He's super supply block Needs to build three depots at the same time Probably can just throw down a command center, yeah, and two extra barracks at the same time Just do it, buddy I know you want to Don't pretend like this was all planned Just another CC Just do it, man I know you can I know you can But, yeah, softter actually is in a very, very good spot right now Softr is actually going to be just way ahead equal worker count, third base is faster The only thing he's really lacking is a second and third wax. It's not like he doesn't have the money for it, but he's just saving right now for bad times, you know Oh, he's playing Mac Oh, okay, okay So he's going to be taking the gases before Barracks 2 and 3, which means he's going to be playing Mac And makes sense, of course I kind of should have seen that coming The barracks All right All right, Sifter You got me again This is awful Now, the reason this is terrible is because whenever you play bio, the most important thing is the timing on the stim and the combat shield. The longer you delay the extra barracks, the later those things will be, the longer toss has to kind of recover from whatever damage you did initially because they won't have to be afraid of anything Any army that consists of bio that doesn't have stim and combat shield, It's just pretty weak Sometimes there's some tank pushes with just Tim or tank push with just combat shield Like there is some of them, but they're very, very rare And this definitely isn't one of them Like, this is not a builder This also wasn't planned because he was continuously floating seven, 800 minerals Taking the extra gases before barracks two and three is just awful It's objectively wrong Like, there's no discussion about this. You're not going to find a Terran who will be able to defend this unless perhaps you paid them enough money So, Sifter, if you're very rich and you want to disagree with me, then perhaps you turmoil or clam if you write them a big check, we'll be able to help you out there to humiliate me in public But otherwise, you're wrong, buddy This is not the way Gets double eBay as well I do like that And we're going to be going into a, it seems to be a bit of a macro game Now, he's still up in workers. He's on 44, which is fine because he has triple, triple mulech as well and he with triple cc he can actually continue building workers very very fast those continues losing uh i think a bunch of workers or well actually not the cases he has the battery here it's going to lose one or two is there no observer at all i don't think this one's going to move i think we're going to be building an observer from here, yep So we have the unmicrode bench, he doing absolutely nothing It's impressive He knows there's nothing in the main. It's like, you know what? You know what would be better? I either have a base that is undefended completely, or I have a base where his stalkers are and where there's a battery to defend the probes And my man softer, with the genius decision making that he has shown so far, decides to not only not go to the main, but afterwards starts attacking the stalkers rather than the probes because I think a couple of the probes here are vulnerable This is just impressive to see He's really, uh, you know how sometimes people, you'll look at a replay of yourself and you think to yourself, this wasn't the most efficient use of my unit. My man softer here, he will look at this replay and he can honestly tell himself, this was the least efficient use of my units this is the worst. If you have a skill of efficient and not efficient, he'd be at the zero mark. This would be, you know, I'm not sure if you guys have ever had to, what do you call it, with a thermometer. So you get like a thermometer and you need to know like how to make the scale of it. What you do is you have like your zero mark, which is like water that is about to freeze and you have the boiling. And in between, there's a scale of like 100 degrees Celsius in between. Okay, that's, I had to do that in science class once Awful, but I hate trawling and stuff But a ruler, it's all difficult and fractions God knows it in Finnish elementary school So very difficult Don't worry about that Now, imagine instead of a thermometer, we have a skill of efficiency My man's scepter would be on the absolute. far left or on the bottom wherever your zero point would be because this Benchy where did you go I died already could have actually single-handedly clear this entire base or this base well no there's a battery here so just this base but that's actually what you should have done during this by the way I remember looking at the clock at 630 he hasn't built a single worker not a single one so this this this leaves the question for us what What was he doing? He wasn't macroing He was legit floating 1K He hasn't built a single worker. I hope to God he wasn't microing his Benchy because I actually feel like just hold positioning it there or just shift queuing it in would have been better than what he did just now What was he doing? I can't actually figure it out I just don't know I could go in first person vision and figure it out, but without doing that, I don't think it's possible to see what he did because I don't think he did anything Maybe someone rang the doorbell, he had to get it Forgot to press the pause button, and he just came back He's like, oh, let me float my third down A good call, though. At this point, he's not actually that far ahead economically, is he? Like, his mining isn't that great, especially because he also isn't throwing down mules He's Like, you can't complain about the energy that your opponent has if you never use your own energy, you know? You can't say, oh, my eco is worse because Kronoboos No, your eco is worse because you. you legit have nine mules that aren't being used right now eight three over here three over here and two over here it's legit eight mules like that's an insane amount of money and you're not using it also you forgot to build workers for a very very very long time this is absolutely nothing to do with macro what you're showcasing here I'm just surprised I'm so confused I Like I see, I have this cool overlay where you see the red arrows and the blue arrows and who's mining more And now finally softer is mining more because he dropped two mules Mind you, two mules This guy had eight freaking mules ready And just with two mules, he manages to already beat his opponent. Here, double arrow That means he's way above I don't know what these arrows mean I have the wrong overlay It's okay Happens to the best That's also why we have the ESL Pro Tour logo here Trust me, guys This is not an ESL Pro Tour game, all right? It might look very high level at times, but this is not an ESL Pro Tour game We have another barracks How many do we have so far? We had four The SimCity, once again We got to stop this, all right? Like, I'm done with this type of SimCity Like, eBay's go over here, barracks go over here You build them in a line, so you have some space Like, this looks ugly, man. Please never become a city liner, please don't Even though we've been ripping on our man Sifter for the past few minutes, he still is in a fine spot How did he create this army with what he has, by the way? Look at, let's just pay some close attention, okay? This is an army consisting of 48 Marines That is two times 24 Okay He has one, two tacklers He has one, two tacklers And he's, what's this? Another tech lab on the way He's been consistently producing Marines out of these Finally, he's building some marauders, but consistently been building Marines out of these up until this point. Why? Like, really, why? Why does he think that Marines, if Marines would be the call, which I don't think they are in this case, I think more marauders is almost always better, why would he get the double tech labs? I guess he needs to get stim and combat shield first But then you use them for marauders Stop with this just marine stuff It dies so hard against Colossi, against Archons, against Storm Like, Marines have very good DPS, but the moment any type of AOE hits the field, they start sucking so hard, like Colossi absolutely poop on Marines It's not something you want happening to your Marines, man That's not what you join the Navy for it. Many people say they join the Navy to help people, or they didn't know what to do after high school and the military was there for them, none of them, when asked in a 2012 survey, said, I would like to be pooped on by a colossus Zero Nul Niantos Nada Actually, none Absolutely none Now, that's painful because he does have a lot of Marines Getting some marauders The nice thing, though, is that he can, can kind of hide behind this tanks So what you do here is you hide with your marines behind your tanks for your tanks to the big work They're shooting at something The opponent has to charge into you Then you go This is brilliant. Now this is this is how you can see that someone is a strategic mastermind Okay This is this is actually beautiful to see He puts these, I kind of want to pause for this, but oh my god, this, yeah, this engagement is just high level stuff Okay He puts the tanks back far enough that they can barely hit the outside structures And then he moves his Marines so far forward that the colossi and even the stalkers, I even saw some zealots get shots off without being hit by these tanks That's just impressive It's completely unaware of his surroundings, these Marines They're like, you know what? We're going to fight these colossus and we don't care if we die. These tanks in the back are like, guys, we drive us forward just a little bit so you know we cover the area that actually matters as well This toss is doing a good job, by the way, here Let's not fail to mention that, of kiting in and out of that And you can move two of them forward You don't have to unseach all of them at the same time and then be afraid that he jumps on top of you You can move even one at a time if you want If you're really slow, like, so put one Just put it over here And then another one over here And then the rest of your army, you can just kind of split it around. And with the tanks, you have the best range force your opponent to move into you I love that he drives forward with another tank and he's like, you know what? We're going to go a little bit closer to this gateway because this really is the goal, right? Meanwhile, I'm diving on top of the disruptor Look at these tanks These tanks Two kills, one kill, one kill, zero kills These tanks have been here for two minutes and they have nothing They're not attacking anything It's Colossus on eight 16 on one of the disruptors I saw it Like, this is truly amazing Move him He also doesn't stim half the time Okay, here we go A stim Oh, two of the tanks are shooting. Now, because he's getting charged on, all the tanks are fighting This was actually the worst setup I've seen in my life He also has so many freaking metaphags This tank? there was a tank in the back was this here the entire time of course it was in case this area was too far forward I'm surprised we don't see like a tank over here to defend the rocks or something like that we wouldn't want these nice stones to go to waste with some nasty salad that's a good point defend those rocks body okay planetary now after all of this after literally doing everything wrong in the past eight and a half minutes, he's still ahead He's completely fine He hasn't taken a good engagement. His macro has been awful His unit comp sucks He's ahead He's winning this, okay? This is a okay He loves this A couple of zealots going for some harassed We'll get cleaned up, obviously They moved into the army rather than into the next row A little bit of a mistake from the Toss. Toss is getting an army with a lot of disruptors right now, the way and I'm kind of liking it I'm kind of liking it even though against tanks usually disruptors actually aren't that great because tanks okay so in theory disruptors actually outrange them but because the positioning is very very tight it doesn't tend to quite work that way because if you shoot in range it's pretty tricky and you need very good vision of where the tank is so if terran is good about denying vision then tanks I think are slightly better because of how scan works Um, we have 3-3 on the way The super upgrades is enhanced shockwave Yeah, enhanced shockwave That's an upgrade right there, guys. Now that's an upgrade right there Okay, we see Templar I like that as well I do like some Templar In a prism, that's good Softter has, what's this map vision right now? Very, very good map vision, you see? So this is kind of what you want to see If you're a Terrant player, then it's very important that you see absolutely nothing on the map Now, this might sound sarcastic, but it actually isn't because you know how sometimes if you have an animal with a very small brain, if there's too many things coming towards that animal, like too many ways that it can get excited, it might just overheat, you know, and it dies The same thing can happen with a terran. a Terran has a very small brain size This is overgeneralizing, but on average Research has been done by the Harstam Institute The average brain size of a Terran is about five times smaller that of a Protos player So if you give a Terran too much information, he overheats and he can faint or, in the worst case, accidentally uninstall Starcraft So it's very important for Terran to have absolutely zero info And you see he's doing a very good job at that He sees absolutely nothing He has no clue where his opponent's army is He accidentally saw that there's a fort, which is a little bit painful. This is probably going to cause quite some panic here for the Terran because that's a lot of information for him already But for the Terran right now, it's important that he doesn't see this army move into position or over here or just attack here or maybe a prism in here Like spreading out marines or sensor towers and things like those is very, very dangerous So if you're a Terran player and you know of yourself, hey, I have a small brain, I know I tend to overheat when I get too much info, be sure to copy softer here because that's really a play. Look, this is the type of movement you expect from a guy who has absolutely nothing around the map, but that is not a bug that's actually a feature Okay, don't, no tank siege, because who really wants that anyway? Usually when softer siege is tanks, they're so far out of range that for him it's probably actually better that he just leaves them unseached because then they can't be in crap positions It's like, you know what? These tanks are good over here Let me move forward with my tiny army into this massive army Sounds like a good plan Okay, this is good The unseeges has one K gas in the bank, like the good terrain that he is, builds another command center. I don't even know what this location is, but I love it His building placement has been absolutely fantastic He just, he sees an empty spot and he just wants to build something You know, it doesn't really matter if it makes any sense And I was like, oh, there's space here Maybe the next sensor tower, the next turret will be over here A couple of depots on the left side or an armory here You know, you never know As long as he, if he's there, he's focused and he thinks he needs that structure He'll build it right where he sees it Okay? He'll be the right where he sees it Now, we have softer moving in to attack the fort base. He gets some accidental vision of his opponent Now, let's have a look at this Is this going to be better? So last time what we did is we made sure to be very far back with our tanks No, no, he's cutting back This is, okay, this is good This is what you want to be doing You trick your opponent into attacking into your tanks Look at these tanks They're actually putting in some work And even though this fight probably shouldn't have been taken, the way he took this fight was a million times better than the other fight he took Actually a million times better The only problem is that he. invested a little bit too much in Metafax and not quite enough in things that actually do damage that is an issue if you have three Vikings and 12 medevacs remaining after a fight that could be considered bad but I don't want to be a party pooper here for Safter he's struggling hard enough already in his game I love this one as well by the way builds one CC over here another one over here Oh man the building positioning This is just, this is just beautiful You love to see it You love to see it What are we at for the TOS here? TOS is gaining an advantage in economy again His upgrades are looking solid. He has disruptors a fifth base on the way This observer has literally seen everything Sometimes people say, I've seen it all But this observer actually has seen it all He's seen everything move out from the natural Oh no, sorry He missed these, this barracks He didn't see But everything else, he pretty much had seen move out A little bit of a drop, some solid multitask Is he only looking at the drop right now? This sometimes happens, where Terence only look at the drop, but they forget to do the rest And then they pretend like they multitask That's one of my favorite things in the game Now, here's Don Shimabak There's a way better army. Army that can actually find what? Hello? Oh, throws down a couple of storms I think we should just aim move into this, honestly He shoots a nice disruptor shots on six of his own zealots, but yeah, it's way too far ahead at this point Yeah, this game is just pretty over The game is actually just pretty over Command Center finally landed, though I like that both players take this one rather than just the one over here That's probably a bit closer And now I kind of start thinking, you know? Like, huh Was this really true? Is this really true what softer said here? You know? Let me just open what he said in. He said, \"In this replay, I was miles ahead in every way possible. But Protoss had Disruptors and I couldn't do anything.\" Now, I'm afraid that that isn't completely the truth there, softer. Okay. You were miles ahead. Okay. You were in a really good spot. You were up in workers, you had a faster Command Center, then you decided to stop building workers for two minutes straight, legitimately two minutes straight. You made a pushout, which probably should have hit a bit faster already, because you completely forgot about your Barracks, consisted of only Marines, attacking out of Tank range, into Shield Batteries, Colossi, and Disruptor. And even after that, you were still ahead. Then you decide to get zero map vision, lose a base, because half of your tanks are unseached Your army composition consists of 12 medevacs, three Vikings, and no ground units that do any damage whatsoever I like to blame this on the disruptor I'd love to I love to say, Sauter, you know what? You're right You're correct But I'd be lying, Sauter And I don't like lying That's what you did in your email You lied And I don't like that And for that, you suck All right That's going to be it. for today's episode of Is It Inba? Or do I suck? If you also believe you have something imbalanced, don't forget to send in your own imbalance complaint from down in the description below If you believe I was wrong about my call here about softer, also leave a comment down below, so I know exactly which people do the ban in my YouTube And that's actually going to be it Please like this video and subscribe as well, as these things are fantastic See next time Bye-bye I'm."

        "text": "Dear Harstam, I am a Gold 2 Terran player that faced up against a Gold Zirk player My opponent played extremely passive, the whole game, and even though I knew of his early third base, through excellent scouting, I found it hard to put pressure on him Obvious reason for this are the many totally imba defensive mechanics that Zerk has It is supposed to be the most aggressive of the three races, isn't it? No, I thought Zerk was supposed to be the reactionary race, but we'll leave that for now First issue is the Zirks' vision Putting overlords in places that are not accessible to ground units might be fine, but creep vision is just broken. I mean, they can still see you after you killed all their structures unless you waste a scan Next up, queens are just too strong They are Inba, no doubt My two Madovaks-16-stimmed Marinen drop got crushed by three queens I mean, WTF, crushed by three queens Okay, we'll write this down, okay? I've noticed that whenever people make claims like this, actually specifying numbers, they're never correct Finally, I simply cannot comprehend why Zirk gets lurkers, an invisible seat unit Zirk is not even forced to attack into defensive structures anymore Lurkers, along swarm hosts, are utterly broken from a race mechanic point of view I have no clue what a race mechanic point of view is. Is that the guy that in the Formula One races like changes the tires really fast? Maybe this guy is a mechanic for Formula One drivers and from his point of view, lurkers and so on most are utterly broken That is the only thing that could explain this sentence to me After calling me a smurf, which proves my far superior skill in this matchup, the Zerk even had time to insult me while using its also Imba, Remax ability to push me back and invade my base Please share your ancient ire knowledge with humanity so that we can extinguish the Zirk plague once and for all, greets from the smurf Jerks Holy crap It was on a hell of an email. This email was so long I always put this on like one time speed behind this minute It took me two and a half minutes to read this That's insane We skipped the early game Life is good All right We're following the Tarran We missed this opening build order, but this seems Okay, never mind I thought we could just go ahead and skip, but no, that's not going to be the case Oh no, we need to actually go back now Press this button in a couple of times. What the heck are you doing, my friend? I thought I could cut my working time by a bit, you know? Just like back in the day in school when the teacher would say, if you finish your work early, you can go home early I thought I could do the same here I could, you know, skip the first two minutes of me talking about, the barracks being placed, because who at this point doesn't know when to build what structure, you know? But then I see this guy and I already know we're in for another treat here is still fine, okay? This is just your opener, your Torex opener, your 211 opener, which used to be very popular. I want to say that BN popularized it, but it can also have been someone, I'm pretty sure it was Bion, I'm just going to call, that was Bion You get your Reaper, you get your reactor, then get your Bres, second guess Wait, maybe he did do the build correct, and I just haven't seen it in so long that I wasn't used to know Okay, this is what pisses me off Why does he build it over here? maybe the spot for Nidas It's not very good because you can just build a depot and you want your production structures all close together so you can float the factories and the reactors and tech labs can interact with each other They're all easy around each other. So if you need a different structure, that's how we have some nice micro here with the Reaper Almost gets a link, not quite though Forgets his tech lab, but these are small things Okay So the complete lack of marine production is maybe not the smallest But overall this isn't even that bad, honestly I could have skipped it I should have skipped it I'm an idiot Once again, Circus not taking gas, a classic as well Slight oversaturation in the main But we're paying attention to the Taron here He's a bunker Okay I'm pretty sure not supposed to get a bunker I think it's really difficult to die if you play two and one because you have so many freaking Marines. So you can, hello? Can you get a star port going? Okay So What? He's going to get mines? Before Okay No So you're supposed to get your stim as well because that's going to be the factor that delays it usually If your stim isn't done, you just have 16 Marines in a matter of fact Then you might as well play double reactor You can probably get it faster in that case I'm very confused This Reaper is putting in some work as well I love the complete disrespect here with this Reaper, saying, you won't have gas Wait, actually, Solidi didn't have gas This is good This is a good move Man, here I am, just talking crap already. This is not the right mindset, okay? Let's freshen up a bit Let's freshen up a bit Okay, there we go I need to figure out if this is imbalanced And we always assume that the email is completely true I feel like in the last few weeks I've shifted too much into someone with too much cynicism You know, I'm too negative I already think the email is going to be a lie Instead of looking for things that are true, I'm looking for things that are false So instead, I'm going to be, I'm just looking at his claims You know, and then we'll see if they're true or not That's going to be the player What is this? This is fantastic Nick more workers. Okay, so this is supposed to hit a lot faster than Wait, he built a Tech Lab with a Starport? Did he start the Starport over here? I feel like this game is giving me hallucinations How Okay No, he What? Wait, so what happens here? He flies the fact Okay Well, that explains a lot He just rallied it to the natural And now he can get matter facts And now it's going to look like this is fine, but he's going to hit too late still This is not the proper timing that man I'm, oh wait, but, you know, just because he's hitting too late, doesn't mean that Zerk isn't in balance. Lurkers are still invisible seat units and Swarmost, from a race mechanics point of view, are extremely broken I just have Okay, he's going to hit about like, what is it? 30 seconds, too late maybe? You can hit the timing that he's currently doing with a triple command center opener So basically, he just gave What is this? Ah! Here, I once again fell into a negative spiral, but no, in case that his opponents puts a Nidus over here and then pops out a lurker, you want to have not one, but two turrets It's a backup turret for the Nidus Lurker And you obviously do that before your opponent even started their layer I think that makes a lot of sense. If you don't think that makes a lot of sense, leave it down a question In the comments we know, and my, he's really afraid of muras Someone played one-based muta against him, and now every single game, rather than finding a build order that hits a minute earlier, he decides to throw down four turrets You just love to see it Okay, here's the three queens There's a spine crawler as well, so it's not only three queens And also there is three more queens So it was six queens, a spine crawler, and two spores Now, it's a seventh queen even on the way. This wasn't really, what did he say in the email? He said, my two MEDAVX 16-stimmed marinen drop got crushed by three queens Technically, okay, hear me out Technically, he isn't wrong He just didn't mention the other queens there You know, if I go out with a group of friends and I'm with 10 people and I tell my dad, hey, I went out with John and James, and John and James were two of the 10 people, I'm not really lying, am I? That's kind of what happened here He just didn't mention all the other things that were there as well It did get crushed by three queens It also got crushed by seven queens, but also three queens, technically also one queen was there. I like the way This is, so far, we're only finding truth here, guys And see, that's the difference between looking for lies or looking for truth No matter what you're looking for, you'll find, you'll find it, you'll find it, just like in life You'll always find what you're looking for eventually, especially if you're Tom Cruise And this is Mission Impossible 7 Okay Third command center in an interesting location This is really cool because he checked in his base and it's like, okay, what is the spot where I need to fly furthest to my third base? And he found it I think it might even be further away than this one, which is impressive I didn't think that was possible. A solid early game, SimCity is really helping him out here as well with putting that command center as far away as possible He's preparing for I don't actually know what he's pretty Probably a push with tanks. it feels like he the only thing he got in the past two minutes it's just like oh he got like an i guess he lost the first of matter of fact so he really just got these extra marines a tank does he have an extra barracks now there's barracks three and four okay this is the one thing that's been pissing me off lately is people send me replace where they don't abide by proper barracks regulations okay you go from two into three into five or you go from three into five and then afterwards you go into Stop making four, stop making six I don't want to see that type of crap Okay? I want to see either. Three barracks, two barracks or five barracks The next time someone builds four barracks, you're out I quit the replay I'm done I'll go do something else Play Rocket League or something Start making jokes about that The car's in the balls No one will like it I don't know much about the game All right Do you have an armory yet? There's an armory He can start plus two theoretically, but this macro is simply too clean It's a good army though This Zirk player is actually getting blasted Like, this Zerk doesn't have any army, does he? Never mind, 17 roaches Still, against 17 roaches against four tanks and 30 Marines, as a Zerk player, you're going to go absolutely die Like, there's no way. There's a 15 freaking larvae, though Man, this game is very passive Next time, someone sends me a replay, make it an aggressive one Some fighting power, man We want to see stuff happen We're not here to watch grass grow Although that also is a fun activity I don't think this one actually grows It doesn't even move in the wind Look at these things They're moving in the wind These bad boys, terrible physics Awful Pathetic These also move in the wind But the wind on these is different than the direction on the wind on this thing Oh, but maybe these are moved by these little cock-crow wheels Imagine having the time to do this because nothing is happening Literally he's doing nothing. He's, what actually is he doing? You just, okay, this is his first person He throws on two depots and just looks at his army Fort base There's a couple of marines in the main Oh, here we go Start moving on the map, unseach everything Should I maybe scout forward, see if anything's there or have any units around the map for any type of vision? No, not really necessary not really necessary Is there anything here I need? I see a mine Let me start a depot wall in a random location, but not really finish a wall, just start a wall Take an overlord, make sure my army doesn't split Perfect, perfect, this is looking solid. Okay, I have about 40 seconds until two to two finishes Okay, nice Do I want to wait for three upgrades that are currently building? currently building? No, probably not My opponent decks in me Okay, we win the game Fantastic Game has ended Game is over Well, it should be at least, right? If we look at the armies here, there's two lurkers, but I don't think they have seismic spines So with the crab range, we're actually completely useless He has a crap ton of scans as well Not because he has been saving scans, but because he hasn't, he forgot the mule That's a, that's a big difference there I know that I can feel that He should have had way more money already Okay. You know what? Let me just not seize my tanks for a little bit That is fine I'm going to attack it Longest range unit in the game Bam, just like that Okay Another fight 2-2 has finished Okay, he just absolutely blood He's actually up 50 supply We were looking at the Terran, right? I'm asking this because there's been more than one time where I might have made an I-O-O-this from the wrong point of view where sometimes I had some real fire jokes in there Smurf? He is blue It is possible guys But which one would it be? You have the one with the red hat It's the king smurf Big smurf Well, I mean this game is actually just over. I'm not sure why we're still watching this He rallies another 35 Marines across the map He has 57 marines against 10 hydras, two roaches Is he just going to walk into two lurkers? never scan Please tell me this is not the case How many kills will this they're get? 14 kills All of a Marine? 15 16 17 This one has eight Together these guys killed legit 25 Marines Probably some tanks in there as well He has scans, no Yeah, scans, no yeah He has actual full energy He has 12 scans right now Maybe he does doesn't realize that the lurkers were attacking him and he was just wondering why all of his units were disappearing. You know, after this, he's still light years ahead He has like 3,500 resources in the bank Sure, a lot of that is gas Okay, this is also one of my favorite tarrant things Oh well Censor it Censor it Uh This is it, this is it This is so great great Fourth base, he has 1 6k gas in the bank and his priority, you know, before adding any more workers on minerals, let me take these double gases real fast guys, let me just take those real fast Throw us down three mules Is this guy just going to win the game with two lurkers? He does have the seismic spines now Okay, well, he gets eight lurkers. There's absolutely no way that he's just going to straight up borrow into his opponent The funny thing is that Zirk probably thought he already won, not realizing his opponent was still 20 worse head He's just not going to scan Okay, here we go, here's a scan It's two of them What? What is this? What was that decision making? Look at this tank, look at this guy, okay? He's in range, no? Why can I see the range? He's in range He's like, sir, I got them in range What should I do? Move back Sir, they're not moving You shirt Move back. It's like, what is this move going to do? If he was going to move into you, he will just move a little further now It's not like this matters They were under siege He gets a raven as well He's like, I don't think I have enough scans Meanwhile, on the main and the natural God, I wish I could see this guy's hotkeys because I'm pretty sure he has, he just doesn't have his command centers hotkey He also hasn't been building workers for a long time gets plus two on tanks It's working of a single factory probably still Probably should be adding a second one if you're playing as Lurker. A lot of the pros even get triple Factory and eventually you go into like Ghosts add a couple of Libs as well Ghost to EMP, the Vipers and snipe a couple of Lurkers perhaps Okay Don't forget, Terran is still actually light years ahead If he had any idea of how to get map control or how to get any vision on the map, What's he gonna do? Is he gonna build some turrets, you think? Okay, look, he walks in a line up to it Yes, Auto-Turrets None of the Siege Tanks are sieged The Planetary Fortress is doing a lot of work here Man, this is a great fire Accidentally spreads out the Marines properly as well. Do you think he doesn't realize that lurkers don't have infinite range? And that, that maybe he thinks at the moment the first spines connect, the lurker memory just knows where the opponent's unit is and we'll just keep attacking it until his opponent's unit is Look at He has 5K, 4K in the bank I have no clue what this game is, but I love it What? He's up 30 supply He's flog floating legit 8K resources All of his fights have either been without his tank or with his tanks in the lurkers This fight was with everything in the lurkers and then the tanks being slightly too far in the back. The fight before was with the tanks too far in the back, the fight over here was with the tanks in lurker range. Does he not realize that tanks outrange lurkers? Is that something maybe instead of making this entire video, I just should have told him about the scan hotkey and i was just like send him a message like hey tanks outrange lurkers i feel like these are the only two pieces of advice this guy really needs like and perhaps try adding some production facilities once you start floating more than uh six thousand resources before that you're still okay now he loses to the to the links sickest thing is that Zirk still lost more resources than him shows you how efficient Teren is at trading usually especially his first few of fights were crazy just keeps rallying forward as well probably thinking man this game is really over not realizing his opponent is on 46 workers and has no bank like if he can just stabilize he'd still be fine he keeps building ravens as well no matter facts pure raven and i know that he does it for detection but he has so many scans and he also just could have built 12 new orbitals with the money he'd been floating this entire game like metaphics are just better you need to add med effects i get a crap ton of tanks ghost then some liberators and you're absolutely fine well in this case just a single tank in a position that could shoot probably would have just been enough this game okay this is This was awful. This was actually awful I hate this Okay? Our player didn't play that bad He actually didn't play that bad I think he actually might have been outplaying his opponent Honestly, he was winning He did a tank push He practiced a tank push But the moment anything that isn't a basic unit comes on the map, I think he just doesn't know how units work I think he actually doesn't know how the lurker is countered He doesn't know that tanks outrange them He doesn't know that lurkers can shoot up How is your response, mess ravens versus this? When you're constantly having enough scans to see the entire map. He could literally scan the entire map and still have four extra scans to scan just on top of the lurkers I want to read your thing one more time The Zerk had time to insult me while using its remix ability to push me back and invade my base The Zerk didn't max out a single time He was constantly down like 50 supply or 40 supply But you just didn't kill the lurkers There were lurkers in there There were from the start of the game Probably like triple digit kills It's like American sniper is nothing compared to these guys You just stood there in range of the lurker You did nothing. Why did you even mention the overlords in places that are not accessible to ground and the creep? He had like half a creep tumor, this guy None of these things were the issue What do you mean overlords in place is not accessible? You just died to He could have built two lurkers and won the game with two lurkers You wouldn't have done anything about it You just would have lost You lost 60 army supply against legit two lurkers and a roach How am I supposed to help someone like you? How smooth does your brain have to be? I just don't understand it It's obvious to me that this is not imbalanced, but that you suck All right. That's going to be it for today's episode of is it imba or do I suck if you did enjoy this Don't forget to subscribe to my YouTube channel Don't forget to press the like button as well as these things help yeah I'll see you next time as well for more videos on this subject bye bye."

        "text": "Hello, Mr De Coney I humbly request a cross-examination to what I believe is mathematical proof that Terran is Inba I'm a diamond tozer and played a ZVT in an in-house tournament My opponent is a superior player than I am He's master's ranked Therefore, my game plan was to choose of three-base Bainbust, since one or two base would be obvious from early scout And he always scouts early He went fast 3-C with no units I punished that heart with my bailing bust I brought him down to two SUVs, with the supply reading 11 to 39 in my favor I thought, surely, the sub can't lie Yet I walked away with the L somehow. Is this not empirical proof that Mews are imba? If a terran can go down to two workers and still win, what is the point of this game? Or do I just suck? With regards, Chang'un So his question is, did the sub lie? Or is it just like the hips? And they don't lie Let's figure this out As in the bottom right, we have Mr Chang'un, spawning as the Red Zirk player And in the top left, we have the Terran who is Thiel, I think, or Cian, and it's U So we have a quick look to see what Now, this is a start This is Let's just look at this because there's a couple of things that happen here I want to explain. First of all, the reason this happens is because the stop hotkey is the same as the hotkey for select larva So when you select the larva, or when you click the hatchery and you press the S hotkey, it selects larva and you can build a drone or an overlord, whatever If you have all your drones selected, all of them will stop moving This is not what I was interested in because When he does this, okay, here we go Look at this Look how he fixes this problem, okay? Selects three in the middle, two on the right, two on the left He has an optimal solution for this problem. Now, this should be something that happens once every thousand games, but this guy, It probably happened so much to him that he's figured, you know what? I need some, you know, I need an optimal solution for this When this happens, I need to do something This is a bit like, imagine you're working in an office Okay And the guy next to you just starts peeing on his keyboard, which is weird already, right? That is an odd occurrence You're new to the office But then you're like, oh, crap, peeing on his keyboard it's all going to get dirty and his keyboard won't work anymore. As he's done, he just opens up his backpack, picks out a new keyboard, and has like some wet wipes, cleans it up, and he's good to go in like 20 seconds That's basically what Cheng Hung did here He peed on his keyboard, but he does this so often that is not even a surprise for him anymore He knows that it's going to happen, you know He can't contain himself If you got to go, you got to go That's what his daddy always told him, and he had to go, man The keyboard is dirty, but bam, same model, but newer edition That's Tsangoon in a nutshell So already up to a racing start here is our Zerk player Follows up with a hatcherfers. This is an early scout, by the way He said, and he always scouts early But this is freaking fast Holy crap, what is this? Oh, he's playing CC first Okay Yeah, yeah Well, then the early scout doesn't make sense I'm not sure I think, no, actually, still doesn't make sense. don't matter it don't matter pretty baby then I don't know the rest of the lyric but what are we looking at here there's nothing really happening is there Chang Chang's just scouting around you think he recognizes that this is this is a command center it's like a minute faster I'm always curious at what you know how we have the for a long time we had the mirror test for animals So when you wanted to figure out if an animal is self-conscious, we'd show him a mirror or her, a mirror And if the animal would realize that it's a mirror image, we'd be self-conscious. I feel like we need a test like this for Zirk players, where we can figure out if they have positive or negative IQ by showing them different command center timings Like here, this is definitely a command center first, but I'm not sure if this guy is aware of that He might just look at this and think, oh, this is a command center And then just go back home Just like if you show like a hamster himself in the mirror, the hamster over the hamster This is a hamster in the mirror Then piss off back, like running the wheel Why do hamsters do that? That, now that is a good way to generate some electricity. And I know people have suggested this before, but I think there is some future in that Okay, speed, extractor, queens It's all looking solid Like nothing weird going on here He gets four links because he's like, oh, there's a fast command center I bet there's also a Reaper coming quickly to my side It's not completely wrong, but this Reaper is about, I really wonder if he knows I don't actually care about the rest of the game I think I'm going to send this guy an email and ask him if he realized that I will CC first I'm so curious now The rest of the game can kind of suck it Oh, that was good blocking. Could have built the extractor a bit faster, but, you know, I don't even mind this It's all good It's playable, it's playable Just take this as her third I like that he said that he didn't want to do it from one or two base because that would be too obvious and now he's actually doing it from two days Like his third base is legit a minute, a minute late He's at least pretending hard Come on, take the extractor for the love of God Thank you Marine scouts this third Like the Terran definitely knows something is up He just started walling He's like, oh, no third base The Azirc thought he was so smart He's like, oh no, I fake a third base. He's a German Very sassy German as well I picked the third base And then I send the links across the map Doesn't know he will realize I mispronounced that on purpose to mimic a German That wasn't My own mistake A third cc is a star port It's getting some cars going as well Whoa! I also love it when they do that Pop in, pop out Like some secret method of transportation It always reminds me of Harry Potter when they. flush themselves down the toilet except it's a bunker it's less nasty and this looks really bad for the terran i have to admit so this goes in as well they say when it rains it pours and these buckets it's raining buckets right now guys three links killing every single worker this game is actually over this is actually over i love that he builds more links as well i think usually Usually that's not that great because you actually want to go into drones, but in this case, like, this game is actually over Like, you can't lose anymore It's literally impossible to lose at this point Right? Oh no. I love that he's like, you know what really has the priority here? This starport is like two cars, like shooting at him. It's like, you know, I bet that the Metavac or the Viking that's, that's, you know, I bet that the Medevac or the Viking, that's, pops out of here we'll have a bigger impact on this game rather than the two cars absolutely roasting my links this is this is some solid prioritizing from our jerk player here I don't know the matter of fact what the heck okay we have three three workers I think he said he went down to two workers right we said okay there's 10 more links I love it so right now he has a lead of 20 workers his opponent has three units left so the opponent all upon needs to do is micro these three units. So the entire focus of this Terran player will be on that It's five workers already 14 more workers or 12 more links, 14 more links And now this might sound done, but if he continues attacking, I can see how he will lose Because you're not supposed to keep attacking now What you should be doing is you just drone up You have what, two queens, getting a thing third queen You could legit just go up to like 45, 50 workers, get like five queens at home, and then you can start attacking again once your opponent tries to start your third base or something Like there's no extra barracks Their stim is going to finish at like, like legit 18 minutes into the game. He's still building bunkers Now I love to see where he's going to go This is, okay, this is some A-class decision making, okay? I don't even mind that he fails the bailing bus This is, that is, that is something that I can live with But then the follow-up here Okay, so he has eight, nine, eight bailings Counting remains difficult for me Eight banings You can just right-click this thing and it will blow up, okay? Instead, the links will block him for It feels like infinity And then, yeah, the repair goes off and nothing happens Then he sees this happen, okay? He sees, okay, massive wall There's like a starport, a command center, a barracks and a depot. Like, this is going to take legit like 14, 15 banlings to blow up His response, after seeing a solid wall with three helions parked behind it 18 more links How does this make any sense? He's working of a single gas Okay, imagine you have a massive concrete wall, okay? You have a massive, massive concrete wall And you just used three trucks In this analogy, the truck is the main Just use three trucks to try and break this concrete wall Your trucks, they get very close, but in the end, the trucks don't make it, they explode. Then your follow-up plan is, is to round up all the men of the nearby village and start running headfirst into the concrete wall to try and break it This might sound like a good idea, but let me tell you, my friend, it is not These villagers could be used better for example, to mine minerals from a nearby mineral mine, or to get some of that Vespine gas But no, 18 more links You love to see it I feel like we're getting closer and closer to the answer on the question whether my man here has negative or positive IQ Did I lower the game speed too much? Yes, I did Six more main links Now we're talking He's making trucks again, guys. Because last time it didn't work with eight and now six, now that all buildings are fully repaired, definitely is going to be the play. He just keeps building Lings. So he was 21 workers against 3, now he's 21 against 21, and he's playing against triple CC, so triple MULE. Does he not realize that Terran can repair? Like, does he actually think this will work? There's no way, right? This is in the wall. Oh no I didn't even realize? I thought it was. Even at this point though, it's completely okay. He can literally lose every single unit and be fine. These SCVs will just... Yeah. Nice. Little did the man know that once he breaks down the wall, there's guys with flame throwers. Oh no, what a painful episode this is What a painful episode I love that he could, I love the dedication to this push though, you know The complete lack of transition That's, it's great to see Very often, you see people not as dedicated to a case as this guy is My man Chang'un here, you know He gets things done Sure, it's not the right things, but at least things are getting done If he was a politician, he would have a very weird list of things to brag with, right? Like, usually politicians, what do they have? We helped create this road We build another school I mean, Changun will have like a swimming pool for rats or something like that. Or he'll make like a duck pond, but put it on the top of an apartment building where the ducks can't reach Like, it's like a bunch of very weird achievements and then confused that no one votes for him for a second term You'd make an awful mayor of a city channel But I love that he went for the starport first He's like, he has a potential there, guys I have a good feeling about that starboard there, dude You know, that starport, I think, might just be it Yeah He's just getting blasted My man here isn't even really driving the cars around two. well but that's a good that was a hot pickup is all we call that if I say it when I'm moving to the microphone you know it's real 5 14 workers at this point so our work account now is decreasing as well send a couple more links trying to get the third base no not quite another repairman coming out flame thrower boy is still doing well 10 more links because the past 1200 have done so well how many has you lost actually pause it here I'm gonna guess 126 write in the comments what you thought before you you checked it if you have it correct it doesn't count because then you cheated it was 152 holy crap 152 that's a lot of links I'm impressed that's very impressive and I think really the only 30 40 links did something which means after that he wasted 110 links which equals about 50 drones well a bit more even 55 drones the drones that could have been but weren't that is just great this is this is truly showing what money in the wrong places can do it's a very powerful army but weak home infrastructure no healthcare. See, barracks being constructed back at home I like that the Terran as all just realize, okay, my opponent actually isn't self-aware He would not pass the mirror test Let me just re-wall this I don't need extra barracks I just need cars and a wall Yes, this was great Now, let's read one more time I humbly request a cross-examination to what I believe is mathematical proof that Terran is imba I have to admit, my friend, I don't think this was very imbalanced Your first bailing bust did fantastic Then you just kept throwing links and links and more links and more links into a wall, which was defended by Hellion behind it. You bailing busted wrong buildings like 12 times in a row, sometimes splitting up the bailings between different buildings as well in the end, like awful link micro, prioritizing a star port over Helions while you were in his base, and then just no follow-up, like no follow-up, a follow-up that made absolutely zero sense You would be the worst politician in the world And I'd like to tell you, my friend, that you suck QED All right, my dudes, that's going to be it for this episode of, is it imba, or do I suck? If you did enjoy, don't forget to subscribe to my YouTube channel as it really does help me a lot Don't get to smash the like button as well. I can do that too many times or my table might break with this much power in my fist Yeah, I'll see you all next time for more stuff Bye-bye."

        "text": "I was miles ahead after my incredible early game, and after a solid midgame with good creeped spread, I lost to O P Widow Mines It's just sad how stupidly imbalanced widow mines are I don't even need to explain to you why, as you can see I did not play perfect, obviously But if my opponent wouldn't have built that many widow mines? I think he put the thing in the wrong place now In Wooden, he misspelled that word Enlarge it, Hamster for the people at home I'll have a good laugh already I'm sorry Wouldn't have built that many widow mines I would have smashed him You, as a Protos, obviously, don't know how to play against widow mines because you have imbalanced disruptors. As a Zirk, I don't have a joke unit like that Have fun watching the replay and, Beep, Terrence Name, Wingent, race, Zerk, League, Diamond on EU MMR 3 3 KMMR, I believe that's Diamond Three All right Let's straight up hop into the game As good luck, good luck, race It's a little bit yikesy Okay, random Random So this was a It's a random player And he asked, hey, can you tell me your race? The random player opens with a 13 Depot as well As Vingent is still crying like a little baby over the fact that his opponent didn't tell his race. I mean, that's literally the one advantage you have as random, right? You need to learn nine matchups, but at least your opponent doesn't know what race you have You can't complain about it So, Wingent is not making a hot start when it comes to the manners Also, forgets to send out his overlord as he's too busy chatting Chatty little person You'll love to see it My risk might gain Erejuman, he's laying down the facts here This is my new friend Change his name, hamster Or give him like a little crown on top of the E or something like that So that is now my new, definitely a top five friend already. It's very easy to become a good friend if you have as little friends as I have This was a 14 pool, which is not really a build order It's not This pool timing just doesn't make very much sense Now the reason I say it is because usually you open up with a Reaper as a Terran and whether it's 16 pool or 14 pool, your Reaper is going to be on the other side of the map when the links come in I actually think with 14 pool you probably need to wait a little longer until you can send the links in Errorium, however, it's not really doing much of I doubt if he's gonna get a Reaper? Okay, he's gonna get a. He's playing two gas, two depot before CC So this game is already very, very interesting from a build order perspective, okay? I don't quite know what this is But, you know, we'll look at this, we'll say, we'll say, okay, you know, this is We have to adapt to the situation, you know, we're watching a diamond level game, whole game So we need to adapt to these circumstances I need to get my brain in that mode Usually in order to get to that type of level, I hit my head a couple of times against the wall, but my head's still hurting to get down to the level of last week's IOTUS that my doctor advised me against it. Okay, so he just straight up attacks into a full wall, sees a Reaper, and it's like, well, I'm glad I built eight links out of a four, no, sorry, 10 links out of a 14 pool and managed to do absolutely nothing So great build order here by Wingand, and I'm sure that he's looking at this He actually said that he had a great early game It is possible that he thinks this is good, that he thinks, okay, whenever I just, there's no CC on the low ground and I build 10 lynx, maybe he believes that Zerk is just supposed to win, you know? Usually it's actually the Terrans that do things like that. Like most Terrants, the moment they manage to actually execute a build order properly, they believe that they just get the win if they then also use Stim and, stutter step forward twice It's like, well, the things that I just did in this game were just so much harder than what pros in Zirk need to do I think I deserve the game already It's just not equal in the amount of effort we need to put in I feel like, kind of that's what the Zirk did here, you know, he's very happy that I managed to finally throw down a pool without floating 350 minerals, got out some links He's like, you know what? This actually is a great early game. Well, in reality, he's actually not in that great of a spot He's down in income Sure, his opponent doesn't have a CC yet, but he invested a lot in useless things and right now he's also getting a banning nest, six more links All of these things are really, really weird in my opinion Like you scout your opponent is on one base and you're getting more aggressive options Maybe it's a defensive bailing nest, I guess It's also viable Man, this indeed is a fantastic early game for dessert How did he get it in his head that this was a good early game? He lost 250 minerals He delayed his hatchery by like 45 seconds and he cut like seven drones. And then his response is that he builds 18 more links I've seen last week Sometimes it can work I mean, there's no big wall on the natural yet So perhaps this case is just rushing mines with the red dot So you can't see them after they shoot This is fantastic At this point, I think the Terran could almost just lose all of his units and still just be in a fine position. because it's just even in workers and that's good if you're the Terran in that case it's not getting an orbit it's getting a third gas this game so far has me confused okay I am not quite sure what the focus on I'm not quite sure what's happening in general okay there's a single mine he's going to move in and now he goes right Actually doesn't make him sense He's going to burrow this maybe Burrow it? Burrow it? No? Okay Chases with the links Meanwhile, floating some money He is injecting, though Third base on the way as well 13 kills There's one hellbeth here It's going to get surrounded Guess that's something what this game is. But yeah, I just don't know what this game is actually I have no, I just have no clue Like this entire game just is funny to me So right now, if you're in the Zerk shoes, you might think you're in a good spot But in reality, your opponent has pretty good infrastructure The work account is getting a little bit low for the Taryn and his mining just isn't that hot He hasn't used the Mew in a while There's still no orbital command here So the Zerk is like, I just force you to not have any SEVs downstairs I'm going to follow us up with Ling Bain. Even though if he would just build pure drone at this point, he'd be in a super good spot, right? He'd just get ahead like maybe 30 workers or so 25, 30 workers, which would be big He knows it's Mac, so you probably want to either be going into something like Roach You can also play Ling Bain Yuda It is possible This also is possible, but actually is it in favor of the Terran still now He's going to get a four Blue Flame Helion Okay He scouted so far, Widow Mine Helion, so he knows its Mac, throws down a spire, and gets more links again. How many links has he lost already so far this game? Why can't I see that? Oh, I'm pressing Capslogs rather than shift Okay, 45 links down the drain That's a decent amount Going to get five more drones as well I thought he said he had good creep spread I'm not sure if I would count this at good creepsprud We're seven minutes in the game Okay? Let's count the tumors One, two, three, four, five, six tumors Okay, this is six tumors at the seven minute mark Hamster, what I would like you to do is to show what good creeps spread looks like Get a shot from the game between Dream and Rainer on Pillars of Gold from the latest Intel Extreme Masters. That was good creeps spread This creep spread, your average like diamond Zirk player should have this After like the four minute mark basically, like 4 30 There should be this many tumors already Maybe five minutes This just doesn't What? Okay, so he cancels the spire, builds a double Roachwarren, a Hydra Dan and five overlords Okay, first of all, he doesn't really have much of a plan There's no Evo chamber yet I'm seriously doubting the usefulness of the second Roach Warren That's going to be for Tunneling Clause and Glyle Reconstitution, which is the Roach speed Tunneling Clause is the Roach borough or the moving well burrowed He's not starting the upgrades Ananitis. Maybe this is one of these weird challenges, you know? Like we used to have like the planking challenge It's like the cinnamon challenge, the Tidepot challenge, this type of stuff, you know? I bet this is something that started on TikTok I'm not much I use a lot of social media, but TikTok isn't for me I'm too old for it And I think we might have, I bet Wingent is following a lot of StarCraft TikTokers and they said, hey, uh, wait, the, the TikToks, they keep repeating, right? And there's usually music I'll make the background music myself Pa, pa, pa Welcome Build all the buildings as a Zirk TikTok challenge Boom, boom, boom, boom Jesus, this is going to follow me for a while. Um, yeah, I'm very curious what he's doing Maybe every building except actual upgrade structures This is a classic, right? Gets two roach warrants, then start messing hydras in a Nidas Against someone playing Mac I feel like he could have just ran this across the map and he would have been faster than just standing around this Nidas, like some kind of ceremony Nias look really ugly Just a big mouth I would not want to go in there You don't know what's on the other side either Is this like the worm, the thing? Holy crap, this looks nasty It's going like a drum A lot of the Zirk buildings and high graphics look really yikers, if you ask me Okay, here comes the Oversair. Put the Nidus in here I don't know, like, I feel like just a single tank would beat this army, no? 48 versus 49 workers Yeah, it just gets in position. is a lot of mines but also a lot of hellbs like this is literally going to the slaughter why would he keep going? After the first 20 boys pop out into like 16 halvats does he think that the hellbatch just magically go to the other side so he just invested a crepton into this only got road speed no tunneling claws now rebuild the spire again and an infestation pit he's actually going for every single building except the evo chamber no and then afterwards we have everything except the ultra cavern and I guess he could still go lurker than greater spire as well I wonder if you will make the challenge and then upload it into a TikTok himself as well that would be quite something I actually should make a ticester TikTok. I feel like all of these sound bites are going to waste on the YouTube community. Creep red looking tight already. Look at that. Don't forget that nothing has happened on Wingent's side of the map. Like this entire game has been nothing. This Terran moved out with three Hellions and a Widow Mine. Wingent still didn't manage to clean up this Widow Mine, which somehow has gotten 11 kills. Doesn't he just see this? Oh my God, it's just out of range. Okay, look at this. I want to see this first person. He sees the Widow Mine shot. There we go. Cleans it up. Good job. I thought he might, you know. He might not clean it up. This Overseer over here or the Overlord. Three Missile Turrets. But this terran is on top of everything So we see So Wingent, basically what he did so far is he lost a crappton of links to four mines Then he lost a creptone of units trying anidas that hit like the nine minute mark And then he did nothing Started building drones then another round of units, then another round of drones I love that every single time he builds a new tech structure, he doesn't really care about using it Now he builds three Evo chambers Because he definitely can afford all of this He's a very healthy gas count that he currently has on his 67 drones. Like, what is this game? Is he just going to sit here for the next 10 minutes and make me kill time? There's absolutely no way, right? is this actually what's going to happen? Is this type of replay, I feel like should have a warning where or maybe this, I could use this as like a sleeping playlist, you know, just a bunch of these games in a row where actually nothing happened He's just literally doing nothing He's not spreading Crete, but he's also not building drones The last time he scalped was with his Nidas Like, he has absolutely no clue This guy could have been building like four stories Starports and 12 battle cruisers at this point He's actually. Is he still here? Is he actually still in the game? He still has a heartbeat This is APM is still going The Terran is almost falling asleep at this point I can't believe this is happening to me Is this how people play Starcraft? This is double planetary Oh, here we go Ling run by being set up Look at that This is the classic multitasking as well I bet you that if he would ask Wingent about this move, you would call it multitasking But in reality, there's only one thing happening, and that's this Zircling run by What is he doing? No, some creepsread 14 minutes in game Nothing, hasn't been attacked once Not a single tumor has gone down 67 workers 4. 5K in the bank This is great And he's going to lose to this And we know that already This is a lot of mines, by the way That's just really bad So, now you could say, well, Kevin, you keep saying mines are so bad But what is actually bad about the widow mine? I mean, it does splash damage It can attack ground It can attack air It is invisible There is one unit in the Zerk Arsenal that completely beats this The Brutelord just absolutely blast these units And the reason for that is that you have broodlings. like they will trigger all of these mines and then all of a sudden you legit have what is this 60 supply of useless units just 60 supply this only works though if you trigger the mines with the broodlings if okay I'm going to make a hot prediction here okay what I think is going to happen is he will trigger every mine with his roaches his hydras and corruptors then his broodlords will come in and he'll lose the fight against the three tors and the two Vikings Four tors and the two Vikings I think this is going to be great personally Burrow the mines body I want to see this Okay, there we go Roaches moving forward Yes, corruptors roaches, roach. Oh yeah, clumped them all up Always, it's very, actually is what happened You just love it He lost the overseer as well So he's not even going to be able to end him He still gets a good fight This is how bad, widow mines are by the way like they're not good in large numbers they're good in small smaller numbers like eight nine 10 and especially against ling bain but against units that outrange them they're not actually that good this was a fantastic fight there's no way He's going to fly over them Does he know he needs an overshare? Okay, two overseers. Smart? He's actually just going to fly over mines again and again, isn't he? Like, there's still nothing here for the Terran Terran is rebuilding Mind Tor Viking right now this army should be actually unbeatable at this point it thanks another hit two hydras go down to a single mine shot hydras outrange mines by the way I just want to put this flag here where everyone can see it that this entire army currently outranges mines like all of this these keep shooting He's never going to clean those up, is he? He's never going to clean them up You can feel it already You can actually feel it that he's never going to clean up. Oh, let me see, let me move my hydras in position Overseers move them a little forward Let me tank that turret shot Smart and loses all of his brute lords to mines and two Thor's Oh no Maybe only use the units in the back, no You've got to be kidding me This is actually so impressive Like, watching this is actually a masterclass in what not to do Like, he could write a book, things not to do in StarCraft 2 games And that honestly should be a New York Times bestseller What are the kills on these mines? It's not that many, but it's all pretty big units Like it's not that 50, 3, 7. A lot of these guys have like two or three Hydra kills, I think Oh, no, not the broodlord He's gonna fly in That's one? Maybe another one? You think he doesn't realize? He's gonna send in the link to deal with the mines There's a couple of birds 12 more drones He hasn't been under pressure once, by the way Look at the Terran's vision The last time Terran was on the other side of the map, he was on two bases He's down 8K He's literally had a ranged army against units that are immobile I don't even know how you can lose to this I actually do not understand how this is possible Like, if you think of the way. The widow mine is such a limited unit It isn't supposed to fight well against Brutelords Against links and Bains? Sure But against anything that outranges it, no He just owned this All of these just are now useless If he had any type of army here, he would just destroy it I feel like these mines, I don't really, he's kind of losing too much How many mines are 40 nights? I feel like he just isn't aware of detection I feel like at this point, this guy is just missing so many clues. Like, it's like he has a gun, but he doesn't know quite how the trigger works, you know? He has long-range brute lords to deal with these guys, but he's not aware that he also needs detection And he just keeps sending his poor soldiers forward on every single minefield that there is Like, this just makes absolutely no sense to me Like, he just At first, I didn't think he was actually losing to the mines, but in the past three minutes, he just keeps going back again and again Like, his entire opponent's army consists of mines, and all he's doing, like, there's literally 48 mines and 8 helvet And he's only thinking about 8 helvets, because that's what he can see Like, if he's. he was in the army and he would be playing against those stealth planes, you know, like the things you can't see, it would be over He'd just pretend they don't exist He's like, well, if you can't see them, they don't exist Which is kind of an ostrich-like move Except he's in charge of a massive army as well Like, he just keeps rallying them in And it's not like he's at first he at least He's tried with the Overseers but at this point he isn't even trying anymore It's like he just accepted the fact that he doesn't know how to control units It's like this just keeps growing And if we pretend the problem doesn't exist, they might just go away. I just have absolutely no clue How this guy wins any games I want to see him play against DTs or Benchies or benches, lurkers I want to see what he does If like Muda started harassing his mineral line and he doesn't have a spore, he's like, oh, I don't have a spore already, so might as well just give up my life Just sends the drones into like the corner of his base and then tells his opponent where they are Like, oh, I can't deal with the Muda Lisk anyway Now he counter-attacks, which is probably the best move he's made so far Because all the mines were on his side of the map Like the flaws of the mine are so. so patently obvious that I don't understand how you can miss it I mean, he says that What did he say about the disruptor? This guy had some big talk about the disruptor, didn't he? What did he say? Where are you? Where's my tab with the imbalance? What did you say, you little prick? You as a pro, those obviously don't know how to play against widow minds, because you obviously don't know how to play against widow Mines, but I do know how not to play against Widow Mines And that's what you just did Like, honestly, we could have given him 12 disruptors, but he's just not aware of where the mines go after they burrow Maybe he thinks that mines can burrow underground. So it's like, ah, there's no use getting detection because they just burrow underground away I feel like if we would give this guy disruptor, the likelihood of him killing his own units is a lot higher than if he would accidentally hit a mine This looks so dumb This looks so dumb This actually We've had a lot of games which were weird and perhaps bad But this just felt like there was a bug in the system Maybe Wingent is an AI Like one of the crappy AIs, you know? Don't deal well with invisible units Things they can't see So happy that he built a second road warrant as well He really got a lot of use out of that. In case this one ever fell, he still had the backup road war in the same spot You know, sometimes when I get these emails, these imbalance forms, I'm never sure if these people are serious or not You know, sometimes I feel like they're just kind of pulling my leg to get me to make some mediocre jokes But I feel like this guy might actually believe it If he actually believes it, then I have another bridge to sell him like Holy crap If he thinks mines are in balance, what does he think of Benchies? They're invisible and they fly And they can move while shooting Like, he must have a really weird view of the world. He counter attacks into a planetary with his roaches takes out a quick base Creep Trots fantastic by the way main reason is because mines can't actually attack Creep I think he would have won this game if he had built like 10 crawlers at some point Gigi's out Erojun wins I don't even think I need to do my hand segment honestly this one is so obvious he what is the I want to see the units lost actually I'm so curious 43,000 against 23,000 that's almost double against an army composition with a unit that has like, what is this? Four range, maybe? I think, I think minds have four range, right? Or five? I don't even know It's because it's never really an issue. Like, everything outranges it Hyra, Stalker, Brutlord It's impressive, though, that you managed to lose this I really think it's impressive You actually need to try hard to lose against something like this My man, Iridgium over here, my best friend, he was just making his own, like, beating Grandmaster with stupid stuff And he's done a great job I'm proud of all beating diamonds with stupid stuff This was absolutely awful wing, and your build order made no sense Let's not forget that this started with a cancelled, well, spire, cancelled, double Roach Warren, Hydra then, Nydas Nydus unloads straight into 15 hellbats. Quit the Nidus, get 15 more workers, more roaches than hydras, get Brutlords, which you somehow managed to lose to two Tours and 14 widow mines You never get detection When you get detection, you feed it straight into the turrets and to finish it all off, you actually just let a minefield stay in a location where, and then you just rallied your units into it Like this was, you get, you know how in America you have these achievements, like the purple heart or the Medal of Courage, the Medal of Honor, or whatever, that's a video game, maybe also one of these medals and achievements I feel like if you would be in the US Army, you would be getting the opposite. It's like rather than the purple star, you get like the yellow brick or something like that for the absolute worst soldier that we've ever seen like for a commander you get i don't know what other is like the opposite of the medal of honor you get like like a cup of old coffee like congratulations three years old and it's moldy here you go sir it's not a great achievement no well he said like freaking 40k resource into a minefield which we knew the location of and didn't move like It's just honestly impressive You, my friend, Wingent You suck And you suck real good All right.

        "text": "Hi Captain, your Chinese fan here This game, Dull started with an unsatisfying roach Actually can't be bothered with reading this anymore Let's switch it up a little Hit the tape, John! The early game didn't go so well My roach push got sent back to Albert, my mutiling harassment did some damage The goddess of victory smiled at me I thought this MMR was free But then he still one unit killed my brute lord Toes him by Toes him Oh, hoi, I played the wrong chord Wow, what a fantastic vocal performance. So yeah, he seems to think Protos is a little bit in balance because Tier 1 units managed to take out his Brutelords and a host of other, he did a lot of damage with Mura Ling And then what else was there? Right, his Roach Queen Pushfield Now this form already, okay, it things start, going in my head You know what I mean? So the thing's like, the cockwheels start turning They're a bit rusty My brain hasn't worked this hard since last week I owe this But basically what I'm thinking right now is an unsatisfying roach push probably means his roach push gets absolutely slaughtered Okay? His roach push got owned And then he still thinks that he should be able to win. Now, imagine if the rules here were reversed And we got a protos to send me this replay And the Protos would say something along the lines of, well, my one-based four gate failed, and then I still managed to come back in the game through brilliant DT harass Everyone would be up in arms, deservedly so But with Zerk, somehow this is kind of understood to be okay They do a very, very dedicated all-in or pressure It fails, and then they still want to be able to macro out of it Now, that is interesting to me. It's kind of the audacity that the Zerk player has, thinking, like, hey, I deserve to still be in the game, even though everything I did so far completely sucked So these are some of the things we're going to be paying attention to when we will make our decision Now, of course, we don't want to be too critical of our Zerk player He already has diminished, you know, a mental faculty, as we are aware, most Xerks do have that issue. so we're going a little bit light on him he gets his third base blocked by a probe I didn't know this was a thing but you just you'd love to see this type of stuff all right this by the way is a master's game I didn't mention all of that because this form was honestly so good I thought this can be read out loud there needs to be something more and I think the delivery here was better than just your standard reading um Queen? What was He got his hatchery before his second queen? Okay, okay, so it's like a 20 hatchery This is kind of like So usually there's two ways to play. Either you get your hatchery at 20 supply, which means it like 148 You have a faster creep at your third base You can build a spore more easily But then you have to delay your queens Now what this guy does is he gets his hatchery after his first queen, but before the second So he gets none of the advantages of the 20 hatch, but all the disadvantages That's pretty smart, I have to admit I do like that I do like it when people are just creative and make something that was good before, just a lot worse by injecting a little bit of their own thoughts in there That's just cool. This is a bit, imagine if, uh, After our man Vincent Van Gogh, or as he's called, Van Gogh, had painted the Starry-Stary Night And then someone else would walk over, you know, it's Starry-Stary Night, it looks nice, but what about I spit on it and just spits on it Then, you know, it's a little bit of a cup of coffee He gets out of his pocket, just throws it on the Starry-Starry-Nine and it says, now this looks a lot better No, that's not the case You just ruined Starry-Stary Night He's a beautiful painting, by the way Another fine piece of Dutch art Good job, Vincent I'm proud of you, buddy He can't hear it, though. Vincent, I think, died in the 1700s or 1800s. Very sad story An artist that was never recognized for that. A bit like me Art is never quite recognized for his art. While he was still alive We have two Lings going down in the main base Look, a Probe got a kill Oh, look at him We got him What do we call this Probe? Because he's a warrior as well He's both He's not only a work It immediately went back to work as well Didn't even take any real damage, you know? Like it, this is like the type of guy You sometimes read these stories like, man fights off lion in the jungle while delivering post You know? like the postman in the jungle. And then in the interview, it's like, yeah, you know, and then I still delivered my letters that day That is, where are you? I want to call him Ben, Ben the probe Sounds like a good name for a postal worker as well He just continues with his day job Legendary guy Legendary guy Some dead reflexes over there That's crazy All right Two adepts moving forward I'm a big fan of the pros already, by the way Three gate or, okay, I'm not a big fan of what the ProDos is doing, but we're not here to talk about what the ProDs is doing We're here to look at the Zerk So far, the Zerk has lost two workers and has killed absolutely nothing. There's a pylon at the third base, so that will make up for the two workers lost Never do it If you're a ProDos player and you see this and you think, hey, that looks cool I don't care if it looks cool It's terrible Okay, it's not worth it Here comes an Oracle Actually, gets a worker Nice Good job You know, that's actually good That's good It gets a workers Three workers down so far Early game, looking pretty tight for a prolos player, gets another Oracle, three gates, Nexus at a normal timing as well This Tos build is looking normal. This Zirk build is looking normal as well, skipping spores where he can, which is the way that Zirc is kind of supposed to play I feel like a bit too heavy on the queens too quickly, though, as he is floating a lot of larva and doesn't have the money to put it into drones, which is what you want So he thinks he's being saved by building this many queens this fast, but in reality is actually cutting workers for it it He's just kind of worker with a Ling? I don't worry We got Ben Come on, Ben I bet Ben is going to get a second kill Ben Come on, buddy The world needs you. But when the world needed him the most, he disappeared No, Ben? Oh, no way Oh, he's poking the bear He's Ben is going again Oh my god Look at that No real damage though He scared him away. scared the line away the second he saw he's like oh my god this guy is like a notch on his belt killed the previous line as well he goes to the natural where there's some losers working need to get some friends to help him he also took real damage of course didn't fight back just took it what a wanker all right um where was i i remember where i was in my story oh yeah so this gets a couple of kills so once you only have two queens at a base you probably are gonna need a spore once there's two oracles out or you're gonna or you're gonna need to be in super good position the map vision is pretty poor overlord spread is hello where's my camera so so far six workers gone down on the side of the zirk player but also an oracle went down so honestly not the worst traits he has seven queens three more on the way is going up to 10 kind of like it honestly i don't mind any of these moves his drones are going all over the place though. Usually you don't really want that But we'll keep it real We'll keep it real We'll say, you know what? That is fine It's a pile here My man is preparing hard for a potential all in, isn't he? The pylon over here, the lack of gases I guess he doesn't see a gas over here So it kind of makes sense Ooh, get some more kills? No way I sees no gas over here He thought he saw no gas Right now, if I'm the if I'm the toss player, he gets four gateways like I'd be getting cannons, not gateways, you know? I'd be super afraid He's getting storm, Templar Probably want to get some immortals or something like that. Maybe you even want to get like a robo way at this point, try to pop out some disruptors I feel like this is such an obvious push though He's skipping his fort base He's lacking Okay, if you're trying to hide that you don't have all your gases, perhaps this isn't the gas that you don't take Like this is, this is the clearest gas You know, this is the easiest to scout for toss Like every single time the Oracle flies into the main or anything goes to the main, it will see the lack of this gas Like, don't take this one or something like that Or even this one Like, these are way harder to scout for toss. Also, probably should fake a fourth base when you play something like this Otherwise, your opponent will realize, hey, what's going on over here? We see the toss goes up to, like, freaking infinite gateways Honestly, doing a fine job I like this prolos player He seems to be, he seems to kind of understand what needs to be done to win. games you know he's he's a winner get storm that upsook sends in two adepts again just shift clicks a couple of these workers now sees 35 roaches he's like hey that's off gets an immortal and a void ray immediately starts cannons three cannons a battery four cannons this does is a brain toss is what we call this yeah i see a very good brain holy crap he has no units though how is it possible that this push had no ravages well Is this a joke? I thought he built it in front of him To be fair, I think if you keep this one over here, imagine Oh, he doesn't see it I think now he's Oh, he probably just barely didn't catch it. Oh, that's unfortunate And then he walks on top of it You can kinda see it, but I can see why it's a bit difficult Pop pops open So this is not a great start Then he walks down and gets all of these caught as well Not the greatest storm because it wasn't quite necessary, but I mean, oh, keeps walking down It's like half of my army is still stasis down a ramp Hasn't cast a single bow yet, by the way, to break the single force field Forcefield almost runs out before the bile hits Finally breaks the fourth fields Stasis is gone Oh, here come the biolts, almost instantly this time But he's already lost like 15 roaches for free at this point. He hasn't even seen the cannons yet Did you just go back home at this point, or what does he do? floating a casual 800 as well This toss has a good defense, by the way Like honestly, very solid defense Good force fields Good like zone control Uh, gets hit by a balder This is one time Once again, good force field Really quite impressive This push was a complete failure An unsatisfying roach push Very unsatisfying So right now, if we just have a quick look at the situation, okay? We just, we just take a, perhaps we do some mid-game review Ding-da-d-ding-ting, ding, ding, ding This is the mid-game review Ping-ping, ping, ping. I just did that in case Hamster doesn't have the old tune still alive somewhere, and otherwise you can play both with the Hamster You got my permission Okay, so let's have a quick look, okay? So far, he's lost 25 roaches, four ravagers, 40 zirklings, and 10 drones He is down 11 workers Yeah, 11 workers His army comp is a lot worse than his opponents His fort base is probably starting at around the same time as his opponents Supply is equal He is completely that, ladies and gentlemen This game, by any means, should be completely over This is not a game that should be playable here for the Zurg anymore. As he decides, it might be a wise decision to keep pushing into this army with inferior forces actually gets a couple of decent traits I'm semi-surprised There's an immortal idling in the back Okay, this still wasn't great Overall units lost, also massively in favor of TOS, but the main thing, of course, is that the mining for the TOS has been very, very good compared to what it's supposed to be usually for TOS As he's actually mining more than a Zirk opponent, that's never supposed to be the cake A cake Never supposed to be the Ks There we go, and an S, not a K not even that close in the alphabet. Oracle goes across the map, tries to get a little scowl in, blink gets a research, chrono boosted plus two This thought I like the way he plays honestly It's like, you know what? I could counter-attack, but what if I go straight into roaches and then I might still lose that fight? No, I play it safe I get a fort base, get a cannon, get blink in case of mutilis, start sending out Zellad Rambis as well Oh, this is beautiful I mean, the Zellet Rambi shouldn't be able to do anything, but what the Zellad Rambi does is it checks the opponent's army. it gets to see hey what is coming out of the X and also what units are you using to defend stasis ward gets used oh my god those is queuing up things left right and center I think he missed the the Mura Lisk fly out though no I don't think he saw it I think there's something because there's seven Mura's already okay this is the Mitaling harassment now please do not be confused here as this Mura Ling harassment needs to do a crap ton of damage right now is 62 against 78 workers And the TOS has already been mining So if he kills 16 workers with this, that won't be enough He needs to kill like 30 workers with this to get. Oh, wrong button He needs to kill 30 workers to get back to a semi-even game So Oracle remains alive I like that I like that he doesn't show the Muras I think that's a good call by the Zerk here Probably the first good call he's had so far in this game Muralesk I don't quite see where the links are Oh, here come the links Link's heading Well, they're going to just fight into an arc No, they're going to run into the natural Look at that So this is a bunch of workers going down We're at 72 right now These links are going to kill a lot as well Oh, no Okay, this was a crap Holy crap, he gets a lot of workers. Remember when I said he needs to kill at least, what did I say, 30 or something? 35? He definitely got that He got like 34 workers here We get a counterattack from the Toss, who loses half of his army while walking across the map Loses his Templar, most important Definitely Does have a zealot run by those So even though the Zerk is dishing out a lot of damage, he's also receiving a fair amount of damage He already lost five whole workers His fort base still isn't mining If we take a look at the income right now, mineral-wise it's actually still in favor of Toss. Gas-wise isn't it? Oh my god, this just going to get cleaned up, isn't it? Yeah, plus two roaches a little bit too Okay, this game is just over We can stop pretending now It's actually over The main base gets absolutely ravaged He can, so Zirc can just literally move across the map and, and win the game most likely at this point Right, 54, yeah, probably Yeah, it's just what he's gonna do Now let's see what he does behind this He gets two more overlords because he wants to be never supply blocked, especially this Zerk is very smart okay. He is, most people just anticipate for what's about to happen in this game, but this jerk, in case, In case midgame, there will be a patch where you can be above 200 supply, he's already building extra overlords just in, just in case, just for that specific scenario Instead of saying, you know, maybe I want 10 extra drones? No, he says, let me get three extra overlords What if Blizzard patches this game, mid-map? This is just the brilliant type of thinking that you only get from these cognitively limited Zirk players Okay, so everything dies Now he's like, well, I could do a lot of things I could, for example, not attack the cannons He just, no, he goes here This is fine, actually. Maybe use a couple of roaches to clear the probes Also, not entirely necessary That's nine more roaches He does need to be careful here, because if you do this, so the reason why very often this type of counterattack can be a mistake. you still have a mirrozer right is because he's not he isn't on that high of a drone count himself so if you don't have any anti-air and let's let's let's let's find a hypothetical scenario where a void ray for example would get 20 freaking kills a majority of those roaches yeah that that could potentially be an issue if then your muras are attacking the the stalkers in the main rather than dealing with the void ray that has been doing three damage for the past minute and a half so now all of a sudden this game isn't actually that good He gets 16 drones at this point Probably should be getting into like an infestation pit and carapace upgrades at the same time. I still think Zirk is ahead Okay I still think Zerk is in a good spot Just simply because he's now up to 73 workers He can go up to 8 gas The Tos Army looks like crap Like it consists of nothing He's going to go Malay upgrades I feel like it would actually just be better to either get carapace or infestation pit, Hydra then, and then go into lurkers Like you're playing against a toss that is on one and a half mining base while you already have range upgrades It's not like his army is going to suddenly consist of anything else than he has had for a while. And there's no way he can get a big enough army or a type of unit that can deal with with lurkers at this point i think so what you do as the zirk yeah i don't i don't mind this just kind of flying around with this mutilis try to not lose them just keep your opponent at home and you're forcing out stalkers and then this can plus one upgrades like you're like this is the one unit that just doesn't do it all you're either getting banlings or you're getting lurkers like there's no there's nothing else that well there's many things you can do probably like He probably could tack into Ultra at this point with how far ahead he is. But like the wisest unit composition would be either Lurker or Bainling And if he isn't doing either, then, well, he might actually make it a little bit difficult for himself Okay, Dark Templar gets warped in somewhere Okay, so three Dark Templar We have no detection, obviously Very wise, very wiser player He's like, you know what, I'm so far ahead right now, rather than investing a minor amount of money into detection, I can just replace everything I lose because I am so rich That is very, very smart Yeah, this DT will die instantly He has a creptan of money flowing money He has 3K resources in the bank right now I'm not quite sure what he's waiting for He has 26 larva. He could just be building like either more drones or just any other unit and probably just move across the map and kill this base again At this point, he could probably max out on Corruptor and just pee on this base literally peeing on that base would be better than having it in the bank I'm not sure if actually the 60s I think he probably could though But also just like getting 26 or at this point 32 roaches probably would just be fine It actually would just be fine He went down to 61 workers and he doesn't Oh, he heard me He heard me He's getting eight corruptors Eight corruptors here Nice I'm proud of you, man Mura's still flying around. I think he's lost seven Mutas, killing three workers in the past five minutes. Look this. Look this. I love that how hard he's microing. This is just great. I think this is, this is the, the pinnacle of lower level games. You have a guy floating 3K resources, microing for Mutalisk against a stationary building and losing a Mutalisk. Let's just watch this in slow motion. This is just great. Look at this. What's this APM monitoring is? He's 390980 controlling four Mutalisks against a stationary building. This is just great. You know the machines you sometimes have, where you can see how strong you are, like you hit it, and you see the fire. This is basically like getting knocked out by one of those machines As the ball returns, you hit, you get knocked out He actually got taken out by a building that can't chase or can't do anything Well, all of his focus is on this, these three mutas are his These three mutas are his life right now This is just great This is actually pinnacle lower level play And this is in Masters guys This is high-level Masters, okay? This is no joke, all right? This is no joke 16, okay, loses one more Murat to the stalkers that were just idling here Probably loses all of his mutas at this point now I wouldn't be surprised, yeah, yeah Oh, drone gets popped out as well. I feel like my game speed was not correct That's okay T T gets a couple more He hasn't rebuilt any of his drones, by the way Probably realizing, he's like, okay, I have enough in the bank Why would I He can't see into the future, right? Like, how can he know that this army won't just straight up win the game for him? Well, he can't, because he can't look into the future So what he's thinking right now is every time I lose a drone, my army will grow bigger Because, you know, once you hit their supply cap, I like this a lot I also really love the plus one investment in the links They're never getting pain, just running around with links. Because the Zirk player here thought about his opponent's army composition He saw Arcons and Storm and was like, what I really need right now is units with low HP, very vulnerable to splash damage Let me upgrade those And then he built 40 links with plus one This is the type of high level thinking that you expect from Zirk players That was nice That was nice You're not gonna hear me hate on that move That was a nice move He pop-op and boom, out of the sky That was a good move You know what? I like that move Personally, now he gets the Lurker then This is just great Finally starts plus 3 as well After he built what? 12 corruptors. Maybe Lurker actually thinking about my opponent's army It's like a single immortal Nothing that can really damage my Lurkers at all because he gets in with the links I wonder if this is a good trade at this point I don't think it is You just keep losing workers as well, by the way, which is fantastic too I still on four bases as his fifth gets taken out for, I think, the 13th time I just said 13 because I know how to pronounce 12th 12th 12th The 12th time Moves forward with three corruptors, indicating that something's coming Very often you see this with terrans as well when the Madovaks fly way in front of the army You're like, aha, that's a terran push coming. It's the same with corruptors Like, ah, three corruptors The rest of the idiot can't be too far behind And that's a fact Well, actually not a fact because this is pretty far behind I like that he's already trading with his Roach army He sees like Storm Immortal Stock He's like, I wonder if I can weaken those already a bit with my caveman Roach Reveger army Takes out the rocks Just maybe fight into this before the Brutor's Reindeer Yeah, very smart Now this is good So he's straighting out a lot of the roaches, so there's more space on his screen for the Brutelord He doesn't He doesn't I'll keep them in the back It's like a backup for when the Brutelords die by themselves. I like those moves, honestly I think that's smart Roach Brutelard, of course, unit composition with great synergy as well See, the roach is really doing a lot of damage here So far, I've tanked two storms already The roaches here aren't so much for dealing damage, I feel like, but more for just a general distraction and making the opponent believe that you're a complete clown, which I think at this point that the toss is scratching his head It's like, oh my God I was down like 35 workers three minutes ago I have no clue how I'm still in this game Now here comes the same Brutelord push with Roach Reveger So Roach Reveager tanks another storm. Then the Brutlords fly through an entire storm duration Maybe if he does that two more times, you'll just lose them before the fight Four links take out this base Plus one really coming in handy here Good blink forward, actually, by this toss Some decent storms I mean, the toss is just microwing this very, very well And the Zerk, I think it might have been better if he would have just taken a shower once he started taking his forward It's just A-moved I feel like the units by themselves have better AI than what this guy has shown so far Loses all of his broodlords and all of his roaches. Who would have thought? If you absolutely show zero micro, you have plus one broodlords without any real support Well, you can't call roaches support, I guess, but they don't really are a support They aren't really a supporting unit usually Something like a bainling or like infestors here would have been sick, honestly But bainlings also would have been fine Like you can just bless these stalkers so well Still six corruptors there in case the air switch of the toss on three bases ever dust commands I still wonder what the unit lost looks like, 34K, which means that the Toss actually has mined almost as much as the Zerk, because the Zerk just completely forgot to rebuild stuff. I love that the Toss is going back home as well, he's like clearing some creep He understands that his opponent will eventually probably attack into him again Okay, two Brutelords, the Tier 1 units This is not a Tier 1 army, by the way This is like stalker, immortal, Arkom Templar Like, the Zerk army was way more primitive than what the ProDols have It felt like the Zerk always fights in like little segments where he first throws half of his army away or tanks so much damage that his army is half useless And then it's like, okay, now I can go again She still has two Brutlords, sends them forward Wouldn't want them to be supported by anything, obviously That would be dangerous. Good blinks His micro has actually been pretty good The TOS Micro, that is Now he just showers this in storms He just be a little bit careful, yeah, good blink back One more storm Clears every single Rappager Now micros forward This is a close game still Like this is honestly just been a crazy game I don't understand Oh Wait, does the Toss not win? He's gonna attack with five roach and a brood, isn't he? Ah, he rebuilt lynx That's brilliant I feel like the thing I could really use is links Without adrenal glands, without any upgrades against the potential of plus three zealids Like a single zealot would probably be able to take out This army, oh no, please this Templar storm. Storm yourself, storm yourself There's only one link Sad Dude, this game is way closer than I thought it would be He starts mining again TOS is still on mining because he has this base now 62 workers I love this move Resources are scarce He's like, you know what? What would be a good move? Sending my Zurglings into a dead trap He's lucky that the Tos didn't pay attention These Zirglings should have been dead I guess a lot of them are kind of dead That's like giving away a lot of money right there How actually is the Zer going to lose this? See, just sit back, do nothing and then lose eventually, I guess? I mean, he's up-im workers once this base finishes. He also still has a lurker then, doesn't he? I'm glad that that hasn't been used at all That probably would not have been used for it all against stalkers I guess there's a couple of immortals now as well Brutlord Lurker though is a composition Good luck killing that It's not a real composition, but against this army it probably would do okay A couple more ravagers, nice He's just gonna get blasted, but the TOS Micro is very good Individual Blink stalker Micro, like just the way he moves his units is actually impressive and this guy is just continuously standing in storm I'm not too sure about that, bling Eh, I can't live with it It is just blasted Completely over Actually forgets the Gigi. Actually forgot to Gigi My friend, my friend, my friend Your queen push failed And the goddess of victory didn't just smile at you She basically handed you to win Like, this game was so over Like, actually, so extremely over I have no clue how you managed to lose this It is simply impressive, to say the least you probably, you had so many options Like literally anything would have been fine, but you just sat there, floated like three, three and a half K resources I have no clue why you did that You had larva available You had buildings available. You started bleeding out worker after worker, after worker, after worker, never rebuilding them, never expanding towards a fifth, never changing your composition away from roaches Why would you not just go into lurkers? Why would you not just go into banlings? Why would you not just add two or three investors into your Brutlord army? Like, there's so many questions that I have And I don't even want to ask them to you because I feel like looking at this game, looking at your, the level of decisions that you make, your answers probably will just confuse me even more I don't want to ever hear from you again Got that? You suck And you suck really hard, buddy Nice. All right, that's going to be it for this episode of Is It Inbar? Do I talk if you did enjoy this episode, don't forget, subscribe to the YouTube channel Don't forget to smash the like button as well And leave a comment down below So it helps all of me and my man hamster a lot as well Thank you And bye-bye."

        "text": "Harst them! Exclamation mark Big fan I've been playing this game since 1998 Yes, I've been playing StarCraft 2 in my head since the original StarCraft came out I'm 35 now, and I'm here to complain that Hydra plus Lurker is imba I had a crap early game with my adepts, but I still killed 18 worked and a third base Yet I lost to Hydra Lurker This game is impossible at this level Thanks, juice this game is impossible at this level This sentence makes absolutely no sense He could say this matchup is impossible at this level, but this game is impossible at this level. That means that there's a certain level on the ladder where the game is impossible to play for whatever reason that he doesn't specify I am not quite sure He seems to be complaining about Hydra Lurker, but what else? He also mentions his age He's 35 Maybe he's complaining that he's old as well So we're going to go for three complaints here that we're going to be investigating First complaint is that he's old Well, that seems to be true, but we'll investigate that further Two is Hydra plus Lurker is Inba And three is that the game is impossible at that level Whatever that means, we'll try to investigate and get to a conclusion that will satisfy hopefully most of you. So let's up straight into this game, all right? We have our friend Ice Called Juice in the bottom right we have heasy ice called juice is the person who sent it in i believe he's a diamond player um can't remember the m m mr and it can't be bothered to tap out so um hamster will do some magic there okay let's let's just have a look he says he opened with adepts and he did a crapton of damage okay a crap ton of damage with adepts but it still wasn't enough against the imbalance hydra lurker which um it can be tricky to play against hydra lurker especially at lower levels People struggle against Lurker all the time. The reason for this is that they are invisible And invisible units just tend to be very good at lower levels because people suck at getting detection Listen to what I said They suck at getting detection They suck Suck And that's potential for a stamp right there, Hamster But we won't do it quite yet So put that stamping machine back into your pocket Hamster's always very trigger happy with the stamps You guys don't know that But whenever I get the, we always talk about like the IOTish, you know. know and he edits it and he always just puts as many stamps as possible so every single week after tandem hamster no stamps now I'm like with Kevin it's so much fun and the noise that it makes I love it's like no hamster not not today so put it back in your pocket hamster we don't need it yet so we have a bit of a scout pylon block on the next row as well forced hatchery to be taken at the third we have was hello here we go this is a corps for Nexus? Oh, another probe? What is he? Okay, this is an adventure He's a voyeur He just likes watching people build things. Like this guy is a fake, not actually a worker That's crazy Crazy Zellet? Core Zellet? No workers? No second gas? Okay, well, this is a build order that is interesting Um, well, I'm not quite sure if interesting is the right word I think bad is a better term here Like, it just sucks He's cutting a lot of workers in order to get a zealot out and to get a second gateway and a third pilot Wait, this is his second pilot? The second gateway he doesn't need He needed this pylon, that's for sure Gets an adept Still doesn't build any workers What is he cutting workers for? So he adds nothing and takes away a lot of economy That's brilliant. You do love to see it Also, this is actually very smart This is a move which not a lot of people know, but if you're really confident and you want to show dominance in a game, you just always show your opponent your tech structures in your wall Even though you're going to be building three buildings or five buildings anyway, and you can wall perfectly fine with two gateways and a cybercore here, just build the twilight in the wall as well, so your opponent knows exactly what tech you have. Then when you win, you can tell him, ha ha you knew everything i was doing and i still beat you that is very smart and gives you a mental edge next time you meet him on the ladder so he goes into my man called you here is playing the worst adept build in the world he's building two adepts from two gates that he has okay let me explain to you how the mathematics of this situation work okay i'm just gonna explain it real fast when your cybercore finishes, you have a hundred seconds of warp gate. I'll pause for this, okay? You have 100 seconds of warp gate, okay? In those 100 seconds, if you don't chronobo boost any of the units, you can build three gateway units, okay? Three gateway units, whichever one doesn't matter out of a single gateway So if you build a second gateway before your warpgate research hits 54 on the timer, Gateway takes 46 seconds That gateway needs to build a unit And it needs to be built so early that can build a unit before Warpgate finishes Otherwise, it is wasted effort You don't need that gateway This was a lot of math And I know that majority of the ProDos players struggle with elementary school math, as most of us haven't finished elementary school. I feel you guys, but perhaps Hamster can make some graphics to explain it better And if he didn't do that, it sucks to be you So basically what I'm trying to say is he's cutting early workers and a second gas for no reason whatsoever Also, I'd like to make everyone aware that he's cutting infinite works He just hasn't built any workers This is like a fake natural at this point Like, okay, he's going to do damage with this, but it's still going to suck I think he said he killed 18 workers or something like that Now listen to this, okay? Listen to this Imagine you have a situation where you get a free fight. Okay, you have a fight and both of you get to pick one weapon It's a fight till not a doubt death, but it's a fight who gets the most injuries Okay? Your opponent's weapon is like a knife or something like that And you pick a saw and you start sawing off your own arm Then with that arm, you start beating him up You viewed the arm in the other arm You start beating him up and you give him a major bruising Then at the end of this fight, the jury says, well, like you look lost, you lost your arm and you're like, no, no, no, but I did this to myself. I cut off my own arm and thus, I should be the winner That is kind of what Ice Cold Juice is doing here Like he's merely bruising his opponent while he cut off his own arm in order to even inflict that bruising Which makes no sense Like, he needs to kill 16 workers and then it's an even worker situation, but he will have lost more units and he won't have the MULE that his opponent has had in the past two minutes So in order to get ahead in this game, he needs to kill almost maybe 25, 26 workers, and then he might be ahead I'm not even sure at that point Let me stress that. I'm not even sure if he would be at it He kills 25 workers And he's just been losing adepts already, not doing anything Also, a daily reminder that the fastest time you can hit with like 12 adepts or good time is like 440 with a prism with like 39 workers So basically he invented a new build order, cut out everything that is good, things like economy, a prism, a possibility to reinforce, and then replaced it with a faster second and third gateway that he doesn't use This makes absolutely no sense This build is truly the crossfit of bodybuilding The crossfit of StarCraft This build is to Starcraft what CrossFit is to bodybuilding It looks fun but it's not actually that useful. I don't think there's a big CrossFit community watching my video so we can make fun of them a lot It's like three guys Most of them can't read otherwise they wouldn't be doing CrossFit Nothing better than making fun of people to do CrossFit Unless you enjoy it of course picture a hobby, that's fine So he's actually doing some damage And I'm sad to say that he might actually be getting ahead He killed a bunch of links as well, and his opponent hasn't been mining for the past 10 minutes His opponent also is mining from like with 30 workers, like four gases It's not quite what you want Slightly more minerals, but it's okay. I mean, the end of it, I actually think this game kind of resets itself and equalizes in some weird way What's the follow-up? Okay, some zealots that makes sense He's like, okay, right now my man, ice cold juice, was thinking, was thinking, I already build a lot of adepts now I want a unit that gets countered by the same units that the adept gets countered by So if you think, what beats the adept? You think, Bealing, Roach, right? Separate or together doesn't matter And then you think, so what beats the zealot? Well, Bealing and also the Roach beats the zealot. basically if his opponent would try to counter the unit he's already been building, he would also have the hard counter to the army he's currently building This is what we call a brilliant transition It just makes absolutely zero sense It's a worse transition, you know? Yeah, I just don't quite understand it Okay, imagine this Back in the day when people first wanted, The books, they were, we didn't have the print yet, you know, we couldn't properly print books So what you have is you have like monks, they write the books themselves They had like these beautiful letters that they draw as well It's kind of similar here where my man, ice cold juice, has bought a printer. Sure, the printer isn't great, but it does a decent job in this analogy The printer is the adept Then the printer, you know, it kind of ran its life lifespan and and and and my man ice school juice thinks okay i can do a couple of things i can either buy the same printer again or i can upgrade it but instead what ice ice cold juice does is he goes to the monastery and gets himself a monk to start writing books for him again that is the transition from glaive adapt into pure zealot sure um you do have some company but I'd still go for a printer But I mean, that's just me Of course, that's just me, guys. I mean, who am I? Just your average Starcraft player Overseer scouts My man easy is like, interesting There's probes here There's no third base It must be weird to scout the entire main base and see a single pilot My man's been building his entire SimCity and it's natural Look at this. if he ever gets bainling busted like there's only like 35 banlings to go through the first row and there's like three more rows behind it okay is salads let's take a look at the opponent opponent has six hydras and 20 lynx against 17 zellets I'm really curious how ice cold juice is going to lose this fight I'm really really curious how is he going to lose this fight? How is he going to lose this fight? Seven queens as well You still have Nah, there's no way 17 zealads You can't lose this Seven more drones on the way Makes sense Okay, queen goes down More queens go down More queens go down Okay, half the army starts attacking three drones and extract her. Just right clicks the base Smart I love it That was brilliant He was absolutely destroying the fight He looks at the fight and says, I don't think I actually want to straight up kill all of his units What might be better is if I right click this hatchery with 1500 HP, take that thing out while my units are dying, then I can go home and I still am at a worker disadvantage and my opponent is still outmining me Good call in my opinion It's the type of play we've come to expect here at IOTIS Third base for ice cold juice Fleet beacon, blink, plus one air He's a, he gets every single, every single Twilight upgrade. Did he do them in order? Is glaves the first one and then charge and blink? Maybe he thinks you need to get every single twilight upgrade everything in order Now then he would have gotten plus one air weapons before Warpgate There goes that theory again So he gets one void ray, gets a fleet beacon, and a carrier, a single carrier, while he's getting blink I see a lot of interesting things, but this is definitely interesting I'm also very curious how he's going to lose to Hydra Lurker when he's getting Airtals Like that can't be easy I mean, his opponent is pretty broke as well It doesn't have a lot of supply. There is one upgrade for his opponent, but there's no infestation pit, no seismic spines He's not getting a Templar archives If he gets the dark shrine, a robo facility in a robo way, he has every single tech structure on four gas, which is something I haven't seen in a while It really is something I haven't seen in a while This thing is burning Are both players just not going to do anything for the next five minutes? That would be something as well No fort base here Carrier, Tempest He's actually just building every single unit Two Voidre is a carrier, Tempest After this he'll build two phoenixes, get Anian pulse crystals, then get Flux veins. Maybe get Dark Templar Blink and half a DT as well hallucination scouts I wonder what he's looking at if he's lost his hallucination saw nothing with it this is okay this is no I want to press the B button here look at this this is the type of production tab you expect when someone is on five bases plus one air blink tempest the plus one attack doesn't make much sense but the rest and you also see an interceptor here like this is the most late game production tab I've seen in my life, but my man is still on five gas I don't quite understand how he's affording all of this It's probably because he hasn't been macroing at all, but. He's not getting a fort base His opponent is going up to 74 workers Some slight oversaturation issues here at the third, I have to admit Storm, two two upgrades, plus two attack, plus to carapace Investation pit I guess he gets hive now or what? No Okay, that's fine I mean, we have loads of time It's not like my man ice cold juice has been doing anything in the past five minutes He's just been sitting around, literally doing nothing Has he built any building jet in the main? What is his obsession with this natural base? Like he has so much face Maybe this is like a green zone, you know, you're not allowed to build there We have some of those in the Netherlands. We have a place called the green heart If you want to build stuff there, they'll tell you no It's like what nature protected Maybe that's the case There's some vegetation here I'm not sure if these protected plant species He's just a very environmental friendly person Interesting I didn't know that was also the case in Starcraft, but if you learn, there is some vegetation here as well, but I guess that might matters a little bit less maybe I'm not sure what we're looking at either, guys Like the past three minutes, actually nothing has happened He hasn't once confirmed what his opponent is doing It's getting a second forge But why? I thought it was going into Ayrtos. Does he actually have Templar with Storm? Okay This is the weirdest army I've seen in a very long time This opponent has four overseers I'm just going to speed this up a bit but you have no clue what's happening here They're just sitting and doing nothing He's like, okay, I'll build more buildings over here because it wouldn't want to get any in the main Start spreading pylon so he can add more gateways, maybe Maybe a second Stargate would be smart or going up to a probe count that's higher than 60 Also be considered a wise decision I mean, if you're not planning on doing anything, at least scout what your opponent is doing or expand a bit faster. Okay, we move across the map We're getting close to Max after all You've got to be kidding me, right? He's not actually going to walk through this choke What? Is this what I waited for for four minutes? What is this? What was he looking at during this? I was so curious Okay Imagine seeing this He's full vision of it And he knows there's two rocks Why does he keep going? Why would you do this? They don't even have Okay, they do have seismic spines I don't think they had it at the start, though It might be wrong Holy crap I mean, this guy could have had literally 35 disruptors, and he still would have lost the Hydra Lurker. I mean, if you're going to fight like this, the army doesn't matter I'm starting to get impressed how he even managed to do any damage with the adepts early on, if this is what his army control looks like Like, he must have realized that this isn't it, you know? I mean, this is unreal the level of play here Sirkman just rushes in I mean, at this point the game is just completely over They're actually completely over It's 200 supply against 110 Trolls down one storm, two storms, actually good storms, right away I feel like if he actually just would have gone into mass carrier, he probably would have won At least been in a better spot Its opponent has good upgrades though, 2-2. Holy crap Double force hasn't really paid off yet I mean, it's only 15 minutes in game, so I can't blame the guy too much, right? Only having two upgrades, 15 minutes in a game in which nothing happens Fort race I mean, the game is over We can How long do you think he stays in? You think at this point he's raging, probably He's pretty old Maybe as a kid, his kid was crying and had to comfort it or something like that It's also possible Sometimes I always go for the worst explanation, but maybe he was doing something noble Or perhaps because he's older, he's a little bit slower of understanding already. I think we're getting pretty close to proving that being all this bad for you What was the other thing he said? This game is unplayable at this level I don't know if this game is unplayable at this level, but if I was playing at this level, I think I'd make the game unplayable for me by uninstalling All right, ice cold juice. the question you post the question you asked is is hydro lurker imbalanced or do I suck my sincere answer to this is is that you suck no big spiel before it I'm just going to tell you this sucked okay you attacked into a choke that was extremely tiny just it was like this you had full vision of what your opponent's army was And you decided to move your terrible army, pure stalker, Templar, which is terrible already against Lurkers, through this tiny choke You lost all of it And then you lost the game Like, it really was as simple as that There was, this was no rocket science, my friend. And the fact that you thought that this replay was a good example of imbalance to show me that your brain has been deteriorating a bit So, gets me to the other point is that, yes, you are old And the final point is that, yes, this game might be unplayable for you at this level Perhaps it's time to move on to different things in life Like you have these puzzles, you know, you can do with the pieces or crosswords It can also be very challenging I have some difficult one-star shudoku's in my little Sudoku book that I have If you want, you can borrow it I mean, I can send you some over or can send you some riddles, easy difficulty. All of these things might be a better fit for you You suck All right, that's going to be it for today's episode Thank you very much to Ice Cool Juice for sending in this replay and his beautiful subscription description If you want your replay in the IOTIS, be sure to send it in the form in the description down below Please do note we get a lot of submissions and I do not reply to them unless you're the one that makes it in So, yeah, that's basically it Thanks all for watching If you like this video and we hit 2,000 likes, I will continue making videos If we do not hit 2,000 likes, I will also continue making videos.

        "text": "There harsed him In this game versus a Zerk, man, I was winning by a big amount in the early game, even killing his third No matter how ahead I was, though, the lurkers kept bringing him back into the game Period Every time, no capital letter on that first E, pay attention hamster, every time they burrowed that spot, became an unbreakable fortress, fortress with a capital They are so imba, captain, please, capital P, help All right Very, very interesting Now, he says that the lurkers are becoming an unbreakable fortress His name is innovation, so he is aware that there is professional players. This means that we can go a little bit harder, all right? You have a barracks first opener here into what seems to be some nice gas mining You'll love to see it Absolutely love to see it See it, C C going down a little bit later Is this off position? I'm not sure This seems to be off now This seems like it's nice in the middle Is this one too far up? I think it is This doesn't look correct It's supposed to be in the middle I think it's supposed to be one down Nice This is a good start already You love to see it Within the first five sets We can spot a major mistake. We'll hope, of course, that he floats it later That's always possible We have the Reaper coming out Drone is going to get the hatchery down This is all pretty standard, okay? None of this is really controlling the Reaper is going to get one Ling Maybe MicroZee is probably going to get two Lings Oh wow It's actually doing a good job here Look at that Reaper Micro guys What the heck? This is extremely Three? Okay, the only way this could get ruined if he now ends up losing the Reaper Oh! Four Lings Okay, my decision, leave the game as the Zerg. If you're a Zerk and you're watching it, you lose four links to the first Reaper, it's time to quit, you know? Time to go Boom, next game It's over But our man, Innovation, told us that even though he got very far ahead in the early game, he wasn't capable of finishing the game So I'm kind of curious to see what's going to happen there Because, I mean, lurkers are difficult to play against, but if you even manage to kill the third base in the early game, then something's got to be up Did he Yeah, he floated it down, right? Something happened here This is It wasn't like that before Okay So he fixed this mistake He's going into Looks to me like. I think this is Benchy probably, right? Hellion, Helian Oh, he's going straight into Stim Okay Fast Stim Viking maybe then? Or Liberator? Could be both still But he's Oh Concussive shell And Marauders Oh, okay, Mr 's playing some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, so, some, some, I don't think it is, though I guess you get the Viking to try to deny the scouting and then you, oh my, he's actually hiding in rods Man, this guy is actually playing a, it's playing a good game, you know? Like this strategy makes sense The fact that he's hiding it makes sense He should fake right now another upgrade. Because right now you see this upgrade finish as the Zirk and you go, hey, wait a second Is there any upgrade that finishes that fast? And you go, Stim, Combat Shield, neither of these Aha It has to be concussive shell So right now, our Zirk player should know that something's coming up He throws down a bailing nest immediately, so he's doing a good job here Our innovation has to throw down a supply depot I can't remember the last time I saw the real innovation do this, by the way, where one of his first four depots was a supply drop One of those rare moments where the fictional innovation is just slightly worse than real innovation A Reaper comes back home. We have a bunch of cars, not being used once yet, by the way he's saving them as a bit of a surprise it's not that great a surprise if the overlord can see everything but we'll still count it as a surprise Viking flies across the map as well didn't bother this Viking okay let's just think about it this Viking was supposed to deny all scouting but instead of denying scouting you stayed in the main base left this for overlord alive left this overlord alive so actually completely broadcasted to the world hey I'm moving out wee you I'm moving out We see our Zirk players getting bailings ready as a result as well It's getting a bunch more links. Sadly, it's a little bit supply block and the micro on these queens wasn't all that Misses it transfuse here as well And actually this is looking pretty bad right now for the Zerk player He's down 10 supply already If we see some decent splits, yeah, that was decent enough splits I mean, the baylings didn't connect with all of them at the same time Yeah Okay, this is just actually game right now We see the third command center goal man center going down, barracks two and three are a little bit delayed but still should be fine These halberts are still killing things up in workers, up in units It's going to be up a base as well. He could actually just finish it most likely by going in here after killing this but I mean yeah this game is completely over at this point okay No supply block has happened during all of this He's actually kind of spending his money I don't think the SV production was perfect There's an SEV idling here and there, but overall, I mean, this is pretty freaking decent, you know Unit lost, 3K lost for the Zerk, 800 lost for the Taryn, Taryn is upper base No wait, he's not upper base Wait, what? We're going to have to go back here for a second, guys, because now I'm confused Okay, so he's attacking this base Well, not with everything He's also trying to chase these banings. Okay, he tricked me here because he said he killed the third Maybe he believed he killed the third? Is he just clearing Wait, what's he doing? Why didn't he just kill the third base? Does he think that he took out the third base? And that's why he was so sure that he should have won Like, this base is still alive I'm not going wild, right, Hamster? Well, I am going wild, but I'm not going this crazy This is a this one is still here This is not a hallucination I know you guys at home right now are thinking, did I eat shrooms this morning accidentally, instead of drinking my green tea? No, you're not actually eating shrooms This hatchery is still alive. We have been lied to in the imba form This never happened Usually at least they complain about things and then they'll lie about that they think that something is imba, but they'll actually believe it So it's not lie This guy lied Get a light stamp out Do we have this stamp? Hamster? Do it You lied What the heck? This base is alive He tricked me as well I was like, ah, the third base is that I saw it get low I read the thing and I just assumed it died and he already rebuilt it because I saw something on the meaning map But we've been tricked here We've been bamboozled by this imposter innovation With a five-kill Viking, by the way. That's pretty big Oh, he's actually going to get it He's going to get it Remove the stamp hamster I'm sorry Wipe it out, alright Poor hamster Put in like half an hour making a new stamp, crafting it in Photoshop, just to get removed after 10 seconds This is the type of stuff that Hamster calls me about crying at night Kevin, I can't do this anymore, man I can't do it anymore It's okay, Hamster We'll make it together This guy's playing off of two gas, by the way That's not really a thing You can't afford anything off of two gas You see he's struggling to get more metaphics out at this point He shouldn't be capable of getting any. any upgrades for tanks he shouldn't even be able to really get any tanks anymore after this like he either needs to make a decision how either tanks or matter-of-x he can't get both his three marauders are still going him the killing squad let's give them credit where credit is due oh come on nice okay well one one guy died but I got a queen and they killed a hatchery so big big up to them you know big props I feel like this guy doesn't quite realize the power of gas I've been talking enough with Stetman recently who keeps stressing the importance of that terracine gas I'm not sure if this is Therazine gas Oh, it's Vespine gas. I don't think Stetman can sniff that up Can he? Probably can Look at some stuff coming out there I'm sure Stadman wouldn't mind getting that up his nose It's this fourth command center Three gas is being taken at the same time Right now our friend realizes, this man is a real politician as well, like zero anticipation whatsoever He's like, oh, I don't need the gas right now, so we're not getting more gas kizers That's absolutely brilliant, my friend I'm glad you do not look into the future Because it was obvious to everyone involved that he was going to need the gas at some point See, he can't produce any extra metaphics He's struggling He's getting a 4G really fast, actually This is cool. I think he got this at the same time as Barracks 4 and 5 He's also floating 1,500 minerals And he's still up, 30 supply Now, I always call this the marine or the zealot index I'm not sure I call it index, because my vocabulary is limited, and index sounds like a word that is difficult So what I mean with that is that you can translate money into supply by using the zealot or the marine index And the way you do that is by basically for every 50 minerals, you gain one supply because both a zealot and a, also a zircling One supply is 50 minerals So it's perfect for every race. Right now, my man, if he had invested this money into units, we'd have about 50 is 132 64 extra supply 132 plus 4, 6 196 supply If he could invest all his money into units, okay? I'm not sure if that would have been possible, but I think it might have been possible He at least should have 180 supply at this point So he's down about 50 supply from what I realistically expect at this point with the amount of money that he's already gotten during this game and with how production works as a Terran Our friend is also forgetting to start his 2-2 upgrades, which is quite legendary in my opinion. He builds six depots at the same time because he knows he's going to enter the big boom here It might be able to get above 200 supply He's one of these guys again I like eight depots, right I like that he builds these in the front so he could at least pretend that it was a wall and then he builds two more in the back So we now really are 100% sure he doesn't know how to do math I'm always happy to see that because otherwise you know what happens There's always these guys in the comments. And I know there's already people they don't finish this video and they'll go, actually these depots in the front where there's a wall and they function to make the circlings clump up more and then they flame me as well for like 3D pages about that I suck and I know these comments are out there I want everyone who initially thought this was for a wall to put that in the comments as well Okay, just play open card with me Be honest, say, okay, I thought this was going to be for a wall I'm sorry for doubting you, Harsden Write that I'm sorry for doubting you, Harsden So apology every now and then Nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with an apology every now and then Okay, these Marines get picked up As we see, our men, nine SUVs idling as well How many is it actually? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight One more on the main, come on Nine Oh my God, I can count Oh, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen SUVs idling Oh man Fourteen idling SUVs out of 69 Nice That is a lot It's like, what, one-fifth or something like that? I'm not sure why I keep trying to do math, but it's about one-fifth about 20% of his workforce currently isn't working That's not very great, I have to admit. Okay, he's mining gas with one worker in each geyser, which means he just built the geyser and that worker automatically goes in This is just great He looks at his bank account and he sees 1,200 minerals, 70 gas, that seems about right Doesn't get a 6th gas, doesn't consider that he might not be mining full gas He still hasn't started 2-2, by the way. When did his 1-1 finish? Like when actually did his 1-1 finish is my question here It must have been years ago Like I always feel like it's like four minutes ago or something like that That's so crazy oh it starts plus two Oh two two starts there we go good job buddy Moves out one ninety eight supply finally 2. 2k in the bank Wait What one more time this I feel like this this replay is going to take like 40 minutes by the amount of moves that this guy does that makes sense okay so let's let's see the actual change in the location of the tanks so right now the tanks are over here okay here these are two three tanks over here they're going over there This maneuver cost him five seconds Wouldn't it just have been faster to walk there? This is the guy that gets in the bus Okay, listen to this We all know these people There's a bus stop and the next bus comes in 15 minutes. This guy waits 15 minutes for the bus, then gets off at the next bus stop, which is a two-minute walk There's nothing wrong with his legs He can walk there He could have crawled there Hell, I know there's people that can moonwalk there in that time Actually, did you know that the record speed of moonwalking is something like five or six kilometers an hour, which is about as fast as the average human walks? I once saw this guy who, I think he moonwalked for an hour at like a high speed and he got like the world record for moonwalking I watched like a little report on that Very, very interesting Hamster will do the research there. But yeah, that's this guy, my man, Innovation, the purple Inno Okay, he's still in a good position, don't get me wrong, he's absolutely destroying his opponent He has tanks, he has a crap ton of units, there's no creep This fight is going to go extremely well He just killed 40 supply and he lost three Marines He could perhaps consider rallying all of his barracks to the front and actually producing units while this is happening Can't he just move forward here? and just kill his opponent So there's eight banlings, nine hydras and three roaches And two lurkers Where are they? Okay, they're over here Can you just walk here and kill this? He has 48 Marines and 12 marauders. I think he could A-move blindly into this base and get it No? Why is he moving so slow with these tanks? It's probably because he thinks you can only transport them by picking them up Actually! He thinks that tanks aren't allowed to move by themselves He's an idiot! Don't you love it when I say something and it prediction correct, like not even half a second later Here comes the drop Look at this Takes out the queen Can we appreciate, by the way, the path that this man took to walk on creep over here? Okay, he went, I'm just gonna pass again, I'm sorry, but I have to. He walked from here, okay, he flew his MataFack, this path, then dropped on creep to show his opponent, hey, I'm on the left side, and then he walked in, rather than just stimming 50% of his army, taking out this base and going back Brilliant moves, king efficiency over here when it comes to movement You love to see it loses everything to three banlings Earlier I said, I think he can just A-move and just win Now, I think for anyone with more than three brain cells, that might have been the case, but I'm starting to doubt if our Taryn actually would have been capable What is he joking? Oh, no Not into this position Oh, it gets two tanks, actually. It was not a bad engagement. Okay, we have a drop here. Our man, meanwhile, floating 6K minerals, still not realizing he only has 800 gas. Not the biggest of issues, because he still should be capable of, you know, spending it, spending his minerals. Actually, he's very long gas. Oh, he's another one gasser. This is great. Why isn't he macroing? Okay, he's getting more barracks now. I love that he doesn't realize I have six gas. What are these guys doing? You need a gas guy at first, buddy. Oh, missing a fight. I'm not sure if it's a fight. This, okay, what he's here? he just did is like the equivalent of like throwing a stick at a bear and then realizing that you can't actually fight a bear that's what he just did he's like hey hey hey killing the hatchery was throwing the stick at the bear here start running like a madman and realizes that actually bears are really freaking fast and they can climb trees like a madman as well insane like squirrels do the same but then the bear is massive and fast and kills you there's no matter of fact here Man, he really took out this extractor Holy crap he destroyed this extractor No! Extractor lives! Final shot, no, okay, well Wasted money, that's okay. I wonder what the traits of me like Still in favor of innovation here This is fantastic, okay? Here we go It's impressive because I feel like he hasn't microed his army once He's going for the greater spire I love the positivity that he has He gets a greater spire Next to this queen with the transfuse uses, okay That's, that's big That is, that is, that is, that is some neuroplasticity He, he managed to do that because he believed he could Holy crap 12 drones for the Zirk 3 3 starts, 15 minutes or well, halfway done I think he done a good job with that actually Is he finally mining? Oh, he managed to put in three in this gas. The other gas can still suck it I take a look at this guy Oh, four in this gas making up for earlier losses He went into Tor, goes Viking And it's still floating 7K by the way Wasn't producing anything again Half of his barracks are just not building units He has 7K in the bank You know what's better than not getting units when you're floating 7K? It's just getting units Even if it's not the units you want Like it's better to be maxed than to not be maxed, you know? Another one Does he not realize you can queue up SUVs into a gas before it finishes? Take the gases body Like does he not. How does this even work? Like how actually does this work? It's kind of lose this base It wasn't in position And there's no tanks in this army You need tank Tank ghost is really sick against this He's just standing in the lurkers here in the Lurkers here, trying to snipe half a Brutlord Not realizing that his Vikings would have been able to do that without having to walk your entire bio army onto the Lurkers He probably is an ends-justified a means kind of guy, you know? He's like, oh sure, I might have lost my entire army, but I did get those two Brutlors real good, not realizing that there was another way to Rome, as there's many paths that lead to Rome. I always like to say that And this time the path was probably just Vikings, just shooting from a distance, because there was no anti-air except for three corruptors That might have been helpful, but you know, who am I? I mean, who am I? We're on five bases here as a Zirk player Well, we're getting a fifth base, 68 workers Look at this, okay? These guys don't have the quick burrow yet They didn't even have seismic spines yet These were eight range lurkers Wait, how is it possible that he lost that fight? Once again, I think that was negative micro Just actually better not to have done anything there, just aim move That's so crazy It's actually crazy to me. He gets two tanks, he actually ced them in different positions Can we get a scan? Can we get a scan? He's really lacking scans and I guess he just doesn't have the minerals to create a couple of extra command centers I mean he could only build 20, 20 command centers I guess you can't build orbital commands then So maybe he could build 10 command centers and then 10 orbital commands Would that maybe be a fair deal here? Oh, once again gets caught out of position No tanks over here Oh, starts trying to snip them I mean, this is just sad Why are there Thor's in this army? This is to be the biggest overreaction for three broodlords that I've seen in my life. The man sees three broodlords and he starts building Vikings and Thor's like his life depends on it While he already had ghosts that would have dealt with them just fine Still floating 8K, by the way, just daily reminder reminder When's the last time he built a marine, you think? Why isn't he just building marines? He still has equal in army supply? Is he mining full gas? Wait, he flew away his command center? This is brilliant He was like, okay, I have two geysers here mining on this base And I have 8K in the bank minerals, 160 gas What I really need right now is more minerals. So let me float my command center mining the one resource that I do need and then get the resource that I already have enough of, then build refineries on that base Instead of floating this command center to this one, this is absolutely, this guy is clueless, clueless as to what's important in life There's a type of guy that gets a text from his wife that she's currently in labor, and he decides that it might be more important to get drinks with the coworkers that he doesn't even like on the Friday afternoon Like buddy, there's bigger things going on right now One in gas again Holy crap Oh! Four Well, better than one, I guess. I'm not even gonna complain right he gets gas here as well Maybe float this base to the natural ever consider that, my friend? No He's still long distance mining the gas Everything he does annoys me I hate everything about him Just everything Every single thing Six more lurkers He has adaptive talents now He's getting three three upgrades Lleaves plus three attack 21 minutes into the game He's building marines again Now Marines aren't the correct I'm getting Liberators You have two Metavax Just get I mean, liberators are good to get, but you just don't have the gas for that right now Like, you need to get healing for your units How can you miss everything? Okay, more Cc's, more scans Scans Depo over here. Are the tanks in position? No, they're moving in position I like that instead of like having two tanks naturally over here and two over here, he always just keeps moving everything back and forth That way he makes sure that he's never in position That's very, very, very bright He's the type of guy that if there's two donuts left and there's a party of four, rather than giving two people two donuts, or splitting the donuts. in half, so everyone gets half a donut he just throws all the donuts in the trash he's like, I don't get a donut, you don't get a donut that's fair guys is the ultimate clown this fight was not it for the Zerk as none of the Lurkers were shooting but if he just keeps this position it's completely fine and the Zirg actually is mining well like holy crap this Zerk big respect big up to you Zirk player thumbs up dude you were dead Like that was the one part that actually was you were completely out of it You were down 70 supply but you stayed in like a warrior You fought yourself, you clawed your way back in man. Your fights weren't always great but Big respect for you my friend Sure your opponent made it possible But this is really what something else Lurker's going hand Moving forward Another scan This game is just over The game actually just ended Okay? That is no way to speak to your opponent As 11 actually wins the game after what has to be one of the worst start in the history of Starcraft 2, one of the worst mid-game attacks I've seen in the world as well So let's just recall quickly what happened here, okay? For the entire duration of the game, you had too little gas You never mined gas properly Whenever you realized that you needed more gas, you still didn't mine it quickly. It never was even close to in your mind Your wife has already given birth, and you weren't there, my friend That's what happened in this game Second of all, your movement during your attack was so bad and so slow, you kept picking up units that could just walk to places This is like the Terran dropping syndrome where they think everything needs to be a drop because then they can count it as multitask The next time they're complaining on the Battlenet forums or on the Reddit, they can be like, well, I completely out multitasking Look at all these drops I picked up units and dropped them somewhere else and multiple control groups Like sometimes the simplest answer actually is the correct answer. And not a single time this game did you go for the most simple answer You always went for the most complex thing and always wrong as well It's like the kind of guy who gets two plus two and you start writing out like all types of formula and you end up with five It's like that's not how it works, my friend Like you completely messed this up Congratulations Your late game was awful You stopped building units whatsoever You had no map vision, never really split your tanks properly Your unit control wasn't good Use your entire bio army to take out three brute lords. do I really need to go on Hamster give him the enlarged suck stamp okay you suck All right thank you so much for watching this going to be it for this episode of Is it Inba or do I suck where we had another sucker sucks to be him if you like this don't forget to smash the like button it really does help me a lot and helps Hamster out as well he does like watching the numbers grow leave a comment down below if you think this guy sucked or if you think I made a mistake, be sure to let it know in the comments as well And we will definitely read that and look at it and respond Thanks for watching and bye-bye."

        "video_id": "aOD45PxCrI4",
        "text": "There Hars them, this replays sums up the gigantic difference in involvement required between Terran and Protos to win a macro game in lower leagues Being better in all quantifiable compartments, APM, income, army supply, resources spending, supply management, dot, dot, dot, dot Of the game seems to not be enough to be the Protos that plays the infernal quartet of charge lot, colossi, high templars and blink dTs You're also expected to have a cardiothoracic surgeon position with your EMPs, a co-kin addicts reaction time to split your units and to repair your bases from blink DT assaults and a tactic worthy of a famous Chinese general to compete with Protos Mappak, aka observers. How is that fair to expect all of that from a 3K3 Terran so that he has the slightest chance when the protis is just chilling and calmly spam storms? Hell, even when I want battles, I couldn't end the game because of the proto-stupid recall, an unbreakable static defense that gives him a second chance for free Please hars them, convince that I sucked more than my opponent in this game It is EML, Terran player, Diamond Level, 3 3K MMR on EU Now, I would immediately like to jump on something here, and that's the last sentence This last sentence is something that I get a lot, okay? Let's just look at that sentence one more time. The sentence was, please hars them, convinced that I sucked more than my opponent in this game I don't need to convince you that you suck more than your opponent in this game The way I see it is that very often when I get a replay, it's a bit like watching a game of chess between two cognitively limited turtles The turtles might stamp around on the chessboard They might accidentally move the chess pieces in the case correct direction and the way that chess pieces are supposed to move, but never will it actually resemble a game of chess And most of the time that's what happens. Now if one of the turtles at the end of the game claims that he has won and then the other turtle starts complaining, no one in their right mind would say something about the balance of chess, even though that statement might be correct For example, if the turtle playing the white piece at once said, wow, uh, a, a, a, a I had such a big advantage playing the white pieces, even though this might be correct, there is no way that we could have concluded that reasonably from watching the game between the two cognitively limited turtles And that is why I don't care about who sucks more I care about whether you suck at all And very often the answer to that is yes. But once again, I will be going into this game as objective as possible My goal always is to award the imbalance stamp you know it's a rare stamp we haven't really seen it very much yet um so yeah i i let's just hope that this is the day that we get it let's just hope that this is the day we get it so we have eml versus carpini it's an italian player definitely i'm sure what carpiini means but i i i like it EML, LME, no Sometimes the letters mean something backwards, but I don't know what this means So we're not gonna put any more effort into that. We see our Terran player opening up with a double depot wall into two Marines and no, and a command center Okay, not really a build order, but I mean, I can dig it I can, at least he's trying, you know, we have something here So usually what you do is you play Marine Command Center Factory or you play Marine Command Center Reactor Factory or you play Reaper Command Center Marine Reactor Factory I think that sounds correct but what he did here is not a thing Like I said, I'm not going to complain about this, okay? I'm fine with this This is okay It's okay It's at least resembling an opener Okay, second barracks going down. three second barracks he's still on one gas okay takes a second gas now and he starts scouting at the two minute mark like almost a three minute mark i'm not too familiar with this should start a bunker probably should have started a bunker a while ago so if you're just opening up with marines no reaper and like no marauder or anything like that and you skip a bunker if your opponent walks across the map with a stalker and actually start microing you lose all of your Marines and probably should even lose the game So we have a bunker here, two stalkers arrive Yeah, okay, this is this is actually pretty okay by the toss Snipes the SV is a good scut guiding. It's nice guiding I like this You could probably move back a little bit faster, but what is he doing okay gets a tech lab as a tech lab on the factory and isn't really using it? He's going to lose all of his Marines isn't he? No It's nice micro by the Tos, eh? Taryn has nothing to say here, nothing to say How many Marines do you lose already? Four Marines, four SCVs TOS Oh! Doesn't even even though he's looking good It's gonna get another Marine even though he has a tech lab here It's not getting anything from the factory Like something that might make a lot of sense here is to actually open with a cyclone. Like if you're being attacked like this, to just get a cyclone if you forgot your bunker I mean, this game is just actually over Like, my man Protos here has been Microw like a god He absolutely destroyed this No marauder being built, no conclusive show also could be a tool Why did he get such a fast factory in Starboard to not use it? It's hard to really judge it Okay, here we go This gets a tank I mean, it makes some sense at least Probably should float this away Like you're not going to be able to defend this before it needs to fly Yeah, okay, good I was afraid for a second he was going to lose it. Now, the toss behind this hasn't been producing workers too well, and in general I don't like his build order too much, but I still think the toss is probably ahead after this Like the unit lost is just too far in the favor of the toss And honestly, he's been controlling his units relatively well I'm kind of proud of this top play Carpini, the Italian toss player, actually Actually, he's doing an okay job I'm happy I'm happy Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wow Okay, now this party is over, and we finally get to see the plan here for the Tarran player Gets a reactor Did he start Stim yet? No, I forgot to start Stim He's getting a second tank More Marines. I'm just so curious why he gets all of these buildings and then doesn't use any of him Like it took years for him to finally build a tank, or a cyclone or a mine He almost lost the two stalkers Like even a mine or a helion would have probably been fine He just didn't get it Toss slightly behind an income because of Mules, but mentally he's ahead because, you know, unit lost and all that So What's he doing? What is this tank position good against? If someone really wants to attack this area? movement is all about Okay, so the reason I say this is when you're playing against a blink all in, you actually want your tank further back. So they can just blink forward and snipe the tank Like this tank position is not great unless you really care about this general area and having your Marines out there I'm really quite confused what is happening here Stim finally starts though We have no eBay on the way We have a bunch of mules So this just seems like a massive all in He's going to attack once with tank, marine, marries. in like a MetaVac and three more barracks but he has no upgrades going he won't have combat shield with the push and the toss is just getting into into charge loads into a robotics facility you're getting a couple of upgrades the first upgrade yeah it's the first upgrade but I mean having a upgrade is better than not having any upgrades I see a drop here okay it's interesting so now a single drop across the map seven minutes into the game now usually my blink finishes at about 440 into the game and this type of play becomes extremely risky now this is a different level but I think being off by three minutes is it's a bit yikesy at least so I would classify this as a relatively risky move which could go wrong now it's not gonna go wrong because we see no blink has finished yet and blink isn't on the way or close to finishing but so this should never die right there's no anti-air that can actually chase which means this should actually be able to do a lot of damage here. Stim is available he doesn't use it saving the energy of the medevac it's very smart this a this isn't going in really this is an advanced move saving the energy of the medevac because he knew What is he doing? Like, I was gonna make a joke about that he knew that I was gonna stay alive and then he just straight up sacrifices the medevac That's a terrible drop Like none of these units had any chase, could never catch him He could just fly away and be fine, repair it or something, but I guess it's also good He did get some scouting info. I'm not sure if it's worth it to lose eight Marines and a Medivac to see that your opponent has a Forge and Twilight Council, but, you know, we'll take it. Scouting info, no matter how it gets received, it's always good. It's actually, how's he up 20 supply? I guess he just has more workers and more income, hey? Poor Protoss player. Absolutely blasting his heart out here with his movement, getting Cannons, Shield Batteries, being afraid of his opponent. It's up and upgrade though. Now the Terran is getting double Engineering Bay. Still doesn't have Combat Shields. It's finally getting it. I feel like everything is going a little bit slow for this Terran player though. It's a single Medivac as well, three Siege Tanks. I mean, this army is really powerful This is the type of army where if you have combat shield and like 1-1, you probably move across the map and kind of win with it So now he scans He's like, okay, my opponent has zealots and an upgrade and also Templar, which are I'm pretty sure are all things that he already saw with his drop Maybe he just wanted to know if there's a third base But in that case he probably could have just maybe sent like four tanks in two Metafax to scout that because that seems to be his his way to scout things to just sacrifice a bunch of units that you might need in the next minute and a half. And now our player is not doing anything okay, just sitting around starts as 2-2 upgrades or at least it's 2-1 okay, yeah 2-1 upgrades neither player doing much of anything here I guess the TOS is trying to establish some scouting information He's trying to get some vision with observer, well, observers, observer, a observer on the map The Taron is walling in with deep-bos Okay, I like it I like it a lot Some big, what is this? Look at some modern architecture Close by my house, we have things looking like this, like cube-looking buildings Some weird formation as well It's a bit like this I bet this guy's an architect in his real life Just wants to play SimCity This is a peaceful player. He doesn't actually want to fight I mean, so far he hasn't done any damage, really He lost all of his Marines for free at the start Now, I thought that was because he didn't build a bunker But I think he rather, you know, kill his own units than deal damage to someone else And I mean, his drop also just was for information gathering He didn't really attack anything with it Perhaps this guy is just a pacifist Just doesn't like fighting Except inanimate objects The rocks are being taken out right now Bang, bang, bang, bang How does he have two medevacs with an army this size? These guys are I hope they're getting paid overtime because he's gonna have a good time Holy crap. There's 21 marauders, 42 marines, and there's three metaphax How's that even possible? It's just not built any matter Maybe he doesn't have this as a hotkey or something Forget so you can build them Like you can't lose metaphax here, buddy That's 33% of your healing power Okay Siege is up, stands in the storms Okay Three of the four storms are good Oh my god, actually a lot of these storms were good Where they going? Sometimes I complain about people using F2, but I feel like this guy would be twice as good if he would use F2 What are these Mativex doing? This is like, imagine you get like actual medics in your army Like, you're at war. You're at war, okay? And the war is in Canada And then you send your entire medical department to the Netherlands It's like, first of all, why do you want to go to war with Canada? There's nothing of use that you can get there I don't think Canada has much oil And why is your medical department in the Netherlands? These are interesting questions that we don't have an answer to These guys just went back home They didn't do anything This guy tasted danger and was like, that isn't for me I'm flying back home This is fantastic What is you going to have lost like? Six and the 7K against 3K That fight was actually so bad. I didn't want to pay too much attention to it because he just walked into the storms and I thought maybe we can ignore it, but then I opened the unit last time Like, okay, we can't completely ignore it We'll say that perhaps someone rang his doorbell, and as the fight started, he quickly ran to the door to realize that the kids from the neighbors just, what do you call it, they press the doorbell and they run away This happened to me two months ago It really pissed me off I need to go all the way downstairs to open the door, and then there's nothing there It's like an empty shopping basket in front of my door. I was like, well, I don't know what they want me to do with this, but I just returned it to the shop, obviously, as a good Samaritan that I am I can't remember where I was in this game, though I feel like I'm paying more attention to the proto I kind of like what the pros is doing He's getting cannons It's getting batteries, getting Templar and Colossi The Terran player is getting a good army, but so far he hasn't really shown to be cable of controlling it It's kind of like giving a soldier a rocket launcher and then the soldier just like shoots it in the air to see how high it goes. I feel like that's kind of what's happening we're here with EML It's like he's mightily intrigued by the things that his army possibly could be capable of but in his hand so far he's just checking how fast they can move around the map see how quickly they can die against Storm which also is interesting research but I'm not sure if the ranked ladder is the place to do that type of research Of course, EML, if we have a disagreement on that specific issue, you can always send me another email or fill in another form, as you know how to find me by now What is this? He scans forward, sieges up the tank, moves around with the ghost. Like, first I isolated the metaphysics, now let me isolate the ghost I'm so curious what his plan is here He's going to impede the entire army Okay I think he just lost five ghosts for these EMPs Now, that would have been good If then the follow-up is also that there will be a fight straight away However, if there is no fight, then it wasn't actually that useful Okay, tanks are shooting here At least one of the tanks is Is you move command? Moving forward at least I feel like the Toss can just turn around and kill this now I feel like it's a little bit too These are some of the weirdest stutter steps These are actually very, very. Okay, I feel like a lot of the time he wasn't actually stutter stepping there He was just running forward It's like if you're chasing someone horseback, you know, you're just riding next to him, and you're just pointing your gun at him, just continuously And the other guy who's looking, are you gonna shoot? And he's like, I'm stutter stepping I'm stutter stepping I don't know I mean, he also fought without the tanks Once again, I'm not completely surprised that the TOS won this fighter Well, won It wasn't a big win I think it was semi-efficient, actually, because the Toss moved away Avisal stutter-staping, guys I'm stutter-staping, guys I don't know why they do that It would have been a terrible cowboy movie. That's a movie without Clint Eastwood I can tell you that much It's that guy It's a good couple Ooh, there's DT's I feel like a goldfish sometimes You know, I'm in the middle of a center And then something new pops up on my screen And like, oh, that looks interesting as well Okay Nice Nice Lends the command center in front of his opponent Sees it burning down So again, what's these slashes coming from? What is this falling from the sky? What is this noise? Why is it burning? Is it? No Well, probably nothing It's just a flash wound So lose orbit command gets a command center, flies another one over. Now is aware that there's DT, so we should be starting to build some tourists Yeah, we see a turret here See a sensor tower over here It's this command center It flies so slow Unless you're watching it fly to a base that is un-mined yet as the opponent Then it feels way too fast So there's the T's here Tos, by the way, is playing pretty proper Like his game style is nice, you know He's playing D T Colossi I would have preferred disruptor over Templar at this point because there is a bunch of ghosts So disruptor tend to be better here But I still don't mind it These things, maybe he forgot Theory Did, da-da-da-da-de-de-de-de-de-ha Kevin's Theory Corner. I have a theory that EML does not know the Hotkey for Un-Seat So once he sieges a position, he just stays there forever He probably thinks it's a bit like building a turret, you know? You can put it anywhere except it instantly deployed, or at least deploys very fast And then this is just defense for there, for the rest of the map This is a theory by Kevin We'll see if it's true or not I'm curious now We have, you know, little side games going on as EML decides, it's now time to turtle up Oh, he put a tank over here as well This guy I bet also isn't going to move. It's nicely defending this refinery and the bottom half of the mineral patches Like what is this guy defending? The top part of this ramp Oh! Terrets kill the Observer, that's nice DTs go for a rotation I like that actually I do like that Short DT's here, six to the left Now you need about 9 DTs to kill a planetary Okay, if you use 6DTs and they repair, you're never going to kill If you use 9 DTs, they need to be really fast with the repair to kill it And if they have any units nearby, you'll probably still lose your DTs You need to blink on top and then boom, you go A well protected sensor tower there Oh! Theory proven false. That is scientific progress right there Unseached three of his tanks This DT snipe is planetary? No! Oh, it actually gets it in time That's big That's big Oh, here comes the flag There comes the flank, here comes the flank, here comes the flank, here comes the flank, tanks get taken out There's actually no real anti-air There's three colossal Oh! What? Once again, it doesn't stim Imagine being a Imagine being a soldier in this army and having that drug available, and your Commander just tells you, no, not today But sir, it makes a shoot faster and run quicker Actually do some damage Look at this fight. I just want to show you guys this fight again, okay? So initially, we start off with a flank in which the tanks are left by themselves Okay? These two colossal, that's bad Don't get me wrong That's awful That's terrible Look at this First of all, the tanks, they are solo, as the Marines and marauders are attacking the pilots and doing a lot of damage on this assimilator and the cannon Then there's a move command here Look at this We'll zoom in for that A nice move command into Zellets. A stutter step forward without stim, moves into the storm, doesn't attack for a solid five seconds, goes back to attacking the assimilator and a probe, loses half of his army into another storm, right clicks the planet or the nexus without being stimmed, while flying the Vikings away from the Colossus, sign There's something else here It's an impressive fight You know how sometimes you have these like educational videos or instructional videos on YouTube where it tells you like how to fix your sink or something like that or how to do like a certain exercise and it also has like these three crosses, you know? Like the instructional do not bend your back like this. And there's like a massive red cross and it's like blacked out basically the video like black hand wide Is he like a guy complain about pain in his back afterwards? I feel like EML would be great making these type of instructional videos, except he wouldn't do the instructional part, just the part where the guy's complaining about back pain because he used the equipment incorrectly or something like that You know, or he cut off his finger with the pineapple slicer This is a type of guy that EML, I think, is And doesn't surprise me It's the average IQ of the Terran player of course Tank still over here The theory partly proven true, I think Tank and turret are best friends. Tank and turret are best friends That's potential for a song if you ask me 40 Ts moving into this planetary Well it was an Okay You see what happened here? This was a command center and then when he started attacking He was like, oh crap, I need to upgrade this to a planetary Maybe Harstam won't notice, but I noticed, okay, I noticed I definitely did notice Don't even try to trick me there Good storms The army control of this toss has been pretty okay Understanding flanks, knowing what the storm, knowing what to move Even has a separate control group for for stalkers Look at that targeting down units and stuff Nice Love to see it. Does he always just move command in without stim? Oh this was the get out of Jill Free card With the Oh yeah, this recall definitely helped him a lot Man, this recall completely changed the game Now he stims He's like, let me run to the other side of the map with my completely dead army This Colossack can probably hold this by itself was Dude, he's completely dead Okay, listen to what's happened here He has everything in the same control group, which means that the Vikings never fight, and that he can't use stim because Ghosts have priority in control groups You can see it So that's why he isn't stimming This makes so much sense. It's because he literally just uses one control group for every unit Tank and turret are best for friends It is a banger And then he loses his army to DTs Have his army attacking in a simulator again? Oh no The tanks and they left They left Now they come back Should have stayed here, buddy This was the position after all I was wrong I take everything I said about this position back So lift it, lift it You can lift it You can lift it You can fly It can fly If EML was a bird, he'd really struggle with cats He's really struggle with them The cat is faster He can jump What do I have? Well, you can fly. No, but really, what do I have? Well, you can go to the tree and fly, or you can just be in the air and cat now, but what do I have? The DTs and zealots are so good So one time against, the one time, I just want to, he complained about blink DTs that you need to have What did he say? He had some word for it Cardiotoracic surgeon position with your EMPs No, that was with EMPs Cocene addicts reaction time to repair bases from blink DT assaults Now, let me remind you that so far he once got attacked by six blink DTs here and the planetary one, even though his repair time was pretty slow. Then there was one time over here where there was a Command Center and he tried to trick me by starting a Planetary Fortress as the DT started attacking. Then he ended up, I believe, not lifting it. And then he didn't lift this one twice, I think at this point now. Or just once. No, twice. He didn't lift this one twice now. So this is nothing to do with repair reaction times. The one time you had a Planetary Fortress, you just held and the other times you could have floated your building. You didn't need to repair it. DTs don't shoot air. They're a bit like cats, but it's a dumb bird you wouldn't. understand that another I actually was going to say another no stim and then I caught myself and I was like you know what he doesn't need to stim here because these units are going to die already and now he oh he's stimming again because his ghost died there's no ghost left then he can stim again so usually I always say that ghosts are good to use against protos but for EML I actually would suggest not using ghost anymore because it completely stops him from using one of the best spells in the game and that is stim just decreases his this is this is the damage output of his RV by probably like three or four attack upgrades just because he can't use stim. This is hilarious Yeah this is this is good I'm not sure if he uses control groups or just F2s but I think it's control group or just a single control group And I got us a lot of probes Let me just take out these all of these buildings and let the probes run free. And now he just over stimms by away it's not like this is great you can fight this army buddy like this is this is good to go there we go another stim matter of facts completely empty yep yep yep yep yep now we need to probably start going back oh it's like the fourth move command he had liberators uh f2ed in darn it i lost the game drop the vikings smart move a sacrificial sacrificial lamp I like that Pleasing the Protos god This is off position, isn't it? Probably can still fix it though Looks too far to the right to me And it's flying again Pa-pa-pa-pap-da-ta-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-pa-pa I don't know I do have the things I do either, so Some nice blink d D. T Action Just jumping in forward I think the Protos probably is winning because he has a slightly bigger bank and right now he is out mining his opponent on the other hand there's is his off position that's great that does make me happy oh we have another tank where's the turret though tank and depot are best friends new best friend for the tank it's the depot and the sensor tower but the depot is closer what did he did he build that tank, oh, it's the second factor This base look like two armories It's a single vehicle weapon upgrade You love to see it You just love to see Oh, this is a great drop again Look at that. This is the effective APM that we see in action here, Tarrant player Just way faster than what any protols can do Oh, another drop goes in as well drop goes in as well Both Metafax extremely low Oh, uses Stim No ghost, I bet, on the map Did he stim his entire army? Sometimes they do that when they use F2, you know? Sometimes they do that when they use F2 Oh, here comes this army He just gives up the base Okay, I don't like that the Toss is going for the base right here That's a bad call That's actually an incorrect call, especially because this base is pretty useless. Oh, there's a ghost! There's a ghost! There's a ghost! Oh, I should have done another theory He actually doesn't stim if he has a ghost in If he stims now, that will be it Stim He just 90% of the fights that mattered, he just didn't stim It's an actual fact I did have to do this back Look at it He doesn't stim and he doesn't micro No stim, no micro Single EMP This is fantastic All right Where are you at? What did you complain about? What did you? How is it fair to expect all of that from a 3 3k Terran so that he has the slightest chance when the pro is just chilling and calmly spam storms? Okay. First of all, every single fight so far, you actually had the complete ability to EMP all of your opponent's army The toss, although he did okay, very often was kind of late with his storms Every single time, you had the chance to EMP before he stormed It's basically the same ability, okay? Except after you cast your ability, he can't cast his anymore So really, that was all on you You could have stopped him by calmly spamming EMPs, rather than waiting for him to calmly spam his storms It's not like you were doing anything else Well, I guess move commanding into your opponent army does count as something, but not a single time that you stimmed during any of the big fights. Your stutter stepping was like a cowboy on a horse, not shooting the villain in the movie That's a great analogy there, Kevin I'm really milking that one Honestly, I think your scouting consistent of sending in a medevac Let me not forget about that You left your tanks at home You fought without tanks in some of the fights And then your macro actually wasn't bad Like, okay, you macroed fine You did okay there with every single fight you too You didn't storm You moved commanded And or you didn't, yeah, you didn't stim You moved commanded You walked into storms Your EMPs were almost always too late, except for the one time where you sacrificed nine ghosts. There your EMPs were on time, but you did lose nine ghosts I'm not sure if that's worth it completely Yeah Honestly, I think not only did you suck more than your opponent here, but you also just suck in general You are a mentally deficient turtle, and that's just the way it is That's a new stamp right there, Hamster Pop, like a turtle stamp, right next to the suck logo That be tight All right, that's going to be it for today's episode of am I a turtle or is it in balance?

        "text": "Terran, where to begin? This race is so imbalanced, it's actually sad They can just do whatever they want, and I'm stuck responding to what they're doing In this replay, he had some early game bullcrap, which I think I held reasonably Yes, I probably lost a lot of drones, but I felt like I remade them pretty fast After that, I should have been miles ahead But thanks to Terran's incredibly easy early game defense, bunkers, easy wall-offs, with depots, etc He can hold whatever early game push I might throw at him At that point, I made lots of workers and was going into Hive But he just decided to mindlessly mass battle cruisers It takes no skill, no micro, and he just gets insane value. I know I'm not the best player, but my complaint is that I shouldn't have to be the best player to be the Terran I should only have to be slightly better than my opponent Please excuse the toxicity at the end I was tilted but sincerely shadow mantle Context at the beginning, we just played another match on the latter, and he won with an early tank hellbat push So what is really in this email? Let's just, you know, deconstruct this a little bit So he's complaining about the easy walloffs rather than just regular wallops He has no problem with difficult wallops It's the easy wallops that mess with him. He lost a lot of drones, but he remade them pretty fast, and he felt like he held the early game bull crap reasonably I got some points Some points to look at Let's just hop straight into this game and see what actually happens Okay, look at that Within the first seconds, he typed, I don't know why I play this game This man, this means that he typed that during the countdown So he instantly recued after he lost the last game And then in the countdown, he's still so tilted from last game that he types it in This shows that he has a very powerful mindset, you know, even though he's completely tilted off the self-punishment Dude, my man crawl over here. I bet this guy is a psychologist Like, he instantly, he pinned this guy exactly where he is Like, this is a form of messachism It has to be, absolutely Holy crap Go straight back into the game All right What did he say? the game was, it went well for him, right? Lost a lot of drones, but he rebuilt, re-built them fast So that's going to be pretty interesting to see You see Carl Hungus, I like this name, by the way I don't know why, but it looks like a name for a philosopher, you know Let's see if his, if his place, how he's filled with wisdom Taryn is unbeatable now anyways I like that there's a period. Give some more power to that sentence, you know? You're also, you really do know you're in a good mental state when you start complaining about the matchup before you have even lost That's very, yeah Dude, Carl, who is this guy? I want to meet him This guy has the mindset of a warrior You know, he realizes his opponent is slightly tilted And Carl's like, okay, you know, like I'll cheer him up a bit Even though there's MMR on the line, he's like, you know, I'll try to work on his mindset a little bit And then this guy just keeps saying things, you don't need to be good to beat a jerk as Terran. And I bet Carl will say something filled with wisdom again If your name is Carl Hungus and you're a Terran on the American ladder, I'm going to finish that scent Yeah, Carl Filled with wisdom, this guy My man, Carl Move over Plato Oh my God Confucius You're an idiot compared to Carl Hungus Oh, I love it This is, Carl is a This is I'm following the school of thought that Carl introduces I don't care what this guy does for the rest of his life Like, I'm following the things he says, you know He knows what's truly important in life. He's proxying a factory and my man, Shadow Menthol has no clue about it, which, what was that? Was that Winter? He also plays with the Winter voice, voice, uh, voice pack And also, also explains why he isn't too good I love you, Winter Okay, what's he going to do? I guess there's Helions, right? Three, four Helions You save them up, then you go in It's getting a bunker at home Easy walling This is not a difficult wall You just build it right next to it This is easy, guys I bet right now Shadow Mentos are already fuming, seeing that bunker So easily walled right next to the other one The other hand, we see, look at this, difficult walling. Actually, there's probably space between this Because this is difficult walling This is not easy walling That's the difference between Zurg and Tavis Aaron This is, oh my God, this is so easy Another easy walling Look at this He scouts this with the Ling He's like, oh man, this is what easy walling looks like Now, the thing that Shadow Mantle should have picked up on is that there, so an SCV went in and nothing went out Luckily, Shadow Mantle isn't as, as good on the numbers as the guy in the movie Saul is, you know, who counts the people going to heaven. because otherwise he would have known that there's an SCV here in the main base walking line to the ramp is this a joke? I've never seen this before Oh, there's already one here I didn't even see that Oh, my God, he already has seven kills Sorry, we need to go back How did he do that? Oh, he saved up two Okay, okay So let's take a look what's Shadow Mantles doing So he's scouting right now Pompidom, so something's happening on the mini map Still something happening on the mini map? I'm not sure if I'm actually on his vision Oh, yeah, I am He's just moving really slowly Oh, how did my drones die? Doesn't quite understand it Okay, spore, spore, spine. I don't quite understand the spine, but I like the spore Isn't he curious where these mines came from? Oh, he just heard something? Oh, the link side She's a mine walk, oh, okay, there it is She's a mine walk into his natural Decides the best play is to go keep Oh, that's good micro It was good micro I like that This is still in range, buddy Nice try Carl Execute attempt, Carl This one is killed 10 drones so far already That one's also gonna die Spine crawlers out of range He still moves it within sport range This is a great game Doesn't want to kill this Doesn't want to kill this It's gonna shoot again, isn't it? Hello, we have vision 15 15. Oh my God I just really I really hope that my man's shadow mantle Why is he building another spore? Spores can move I really hope my man's shadow mantle isn't It doesn't build buildings I hope he isn't in construction because he says this is a good beginning Look at this He's down 22 workers 22 they'll come to him and how's the foundation? Strong foundation It looks like there's nothing No, no, no Like it's strong foundation And they put in like the first post and it just sings into like the mud It's like I thought he said it was a strong foundation Was a strong foundation Very strong foundation Like dude, you're dead You're one third of your opponent's workers. The other guy has mules as well You still haven't even cleaned up two of the drones and you're getting another sport to check the one at the ramp rather than moving your sport is a massive advantage that you have as a Zerk Getting two spores for a single mine is like, imagine you're a goalie on a football pitch and you're a bad goalie, okay? And you're like, you know what I should do? I should probably get some glass You get some glasses You can now at least see the ball coming and it improved the situation slightly Then you decide if one pair of glasses is going to make me this much better Imagine what happens when I wear two pair of glasses. So my man Shadow Antel puts on the second pair of glasses Still can't hold the ball out of the goal of course, because he's also a crap goalie That's the problem The problem here isn't detection It is the fact that you don't know what to do when the balls are coming towards you Moves across the map with 20 links Smart Counterattack? Oh my God, what an easy wall this is by Carl That's ridiculous Shadow Menthol actually fuming If you had like a heat meter, you know, like you're seen in his house, he's completely orange and red where he is just lights of his entire room Like, oh my God, there's a fire in that house, but no, just shadow mental. And he sees an easy wall like this That's ridiculous That's absolutely ridiculous What is he doing? He sees this So he lost his links now Now he can focus once again on building drones and walking them through his mine Maybe he can walk a couple of drones into these They're not doing enough damage yet He sends the queen there I really, okay, this was a really, really smart move Not many people understand this move, but I'll explain this to you, okay? So here for a very long time, this queen is just staring it down And he's playing a game of chicken with this mind I'm not gonna go in, you know, I'm gonna go close as possible. Then he goes to inject to truly show superiority and it's like, ah, you know what, let me just tank this mine shot with my queen rather than with a zircling or a drone, which are all, well, a zircling is like one sixth the cost and a drone is one third the cost of a queen Instead, I sacrifice my queen into this mine, and then I can send the other queen from downstairs I finally manage you to clean it up So a very solid way of dealing with burrowed mines on your ramp, I have to admit It's something we don't see very often He also could have used the spine, of course, and not sacrifice anything Oh, he realizes now he can move it. I thought he was going to put on the third pair of glasses He realizes two is enough Is this queen going to go all along the edge and also kill himself into this one? It is possible Stay tuned to find out Spine Why did he build spines, by the way, rather than just getting like two links and sacrificing one link and then using the other link to kill it with vision of the spore A single raven moving across Carl's a legend Carl's floating 1,700 minerals He doesn't care about that because he is very easy for him to all Look at that It's with depots, etc Very easy to wall Carl has no troubles Two command centers because Carl has a lot of money. He doesn't, he doesn't mind Carl is, yeah, it's lots of money Carl, Carl is fine Carl Hungus He's writing a book during this as well Like his philosophy on life How to teach children, how to properly behave Carl has loads of books written He usually writes them in his letter games against Shadow Mental But Shadow Mental keeps recuing every single time after he loses because this guy has the winners never quit and quitter's never win mindset So just keeps going One day I'll beat him Meanwhile, Carl's playing with like his toes, writing a book with his left hand, editing his other book with his right hand Carl has multiple brains as well He's just a lot smarter than the average. Well, definitely smarter than the average Zirk player But that's mainly because Shadow Mantle is bringing the average down so far The actual average of Zirk player probably was pretty high The Shadow Mental switched from Protos to Zerk All downhill I love this The double sport, the double glasses right next to each other Instead of putting one to zone any potential threats, he decided to put both them next to each other absolutely nothing This is the kind of brilliant thinking, the out-of-the-box brilliant thinking that you only get from Shadow Mental You love to see it Meanwhile, let's not forget about the fact that he hasn't scouted anything The last time he saw was a starport going down He isn't aware of anything else happening. He's been down in workers the entire game Like, if Carl invested all of his money into SCVs and aimed across the map with SCVs, I'd give him a 70% chance to win I think that's pretty reasonable It's getting Ling Bane, preparing for to explode on top of these battles There's also 27 Marines down But there's a wall And it's not even just a depot, it's an easy wall Oh my God This is so triggering to see I hope someone, when Channel Mantle rewatches this, I hope someone is close by to give, you know, you don't know what's going to happen with him He might start raging Orbitals! Carl is just chilling Doesn't really need to use the energy on his orbital. Gets a planetary on the fourth Orbital in the main Saving up battle cruisers to make sure he can literally one shot every building on the other side of the map Shadow Menthol, after nine minutes of seeing nothing, decides maybe it's time to send in another overlord Instead of sending it in, just leaves it, hovering over the fourth base Brilliant My man Shadow Mantle still had 39 workers as well He's been building units exclusively, 93 links, nine bane links, rather than perhaps getting a couple of queens, seeing what his opponent is doing, taking a fort base He decides the right course of action is to be down 20 workers, the entire game. The only reason the supplies are even is because Carl is saving for bad times, you know? He remembers the 2008 crisis He's like never again He always keeps the little bank Hidden Well, I'm not really his right there, but you know what I mean Another command center goes down Scarle can afford it He's rich Oh Disgusting It's not really a wall This is just the defenses But, well, this, I guess this counts as a wall It's easy wall as all Nasty See if Shadow Mental is trying to wall anything I'm not sure if this counts as a wall, but I bet that's really difficult to do, putting these two right next to each other. Hey, what the mental capacity that Shadow Mental has is I don't know It's hard to say sometimes You have plus two ship weapons on the way Right now we have six queens against four battle cruisers So generally I think Shadow Mantle is well ready for these BCs as well You love to see it Creed threat continues on Walls, everything Rageborne that he's watching This is his way of raising his heart rate naturally, you know Just looks at this His blood pressure goes up It's crazy He doesn't need medicine for that type of stuff. If he knows how to, like these certain breeding methods to get your blood pressure down, and then he has like just a picture of this, if he needs it to get up, he can perfectly regulate everything inside of his body Shadow Mental is a level above the rest of it when it comes to bodily control He's controlled over all of his functions I like the Blue Flame Helium, by the way I think that's big No, that's really big, actually Because his opponent is literally only on Ling So it's going to be Helian, Helbet, Battlecruiser versus Ling Bain So literally everything that Carl is making hard counters his opponent Like every single unit is perfect Except the 31 Marines. And everything, every single unit that Shadow Mantle made so far is incorrect You don't want this at all Like none of it Niantos, nada Zero Zero Zero No Spire goes down He finally spots the battle crews Wait a second Truly fuming at this point Like, how would I even have been able to find this out? As he has absolutely no clue That he can just perhaps make an overseer, fly into his opponent's main base See that there's like five This was all of two starports Holy crap Imagine how long this took This took like five minutes this transition Hasn't spotted it once Also didn't really realized nothing was coming for him. I think in the past five minutes he legit went up 10 drones 10 drones, while nothing happened Doesn't even have bailing speed Goes into the wall, only bust one depot down rather than all of it, waits until then realize the wall was open already, even though it is an easy wall This actually is doing some damage Which makes me sad and happy at the same time I bet he felt like an idiot, busting open this depot and realizing he could just walk in in I probably could have used these bailings for this Meanwhile the battle cruisers, uncontested, because there's actually nothing that Sheterminty has Shetermintel is not even in that better spot, funnily enough Like, he has a lot of money. If he had a spire and just had like 20 corruptors on the way, you What? Hello? He actually would not be in a terrible spot Yeah, he's getting 15 corruptors now You can just drone back up and he should be fine Well, he won't be fine, but he's down like 8K resources, but it's not It's probably playable with the way that Carl has been playing so far Single battle cruiser I'm not sure if this teleported or flew over, but it just went in and killed the remaining hive Neal steel frame, of course The hardcore I think he complained about turtling as well, no? I'm pretty sure he did complain about turtling, yeah So it makes a lot of sense. That's two bunkers in a planetary That's very scary I like that he didn't really complain about the battle cruiser or like The fact that the terran units counter all of his The terran is extremely cost efficient These are things that at least I could reasonably say, like this is nice to come like, but too easy to wall How do you even get that in your head? It's not even hard to wall as a Zirk either You just build buildings It's the same with every race Like the way the hexas work just always works the same I guess depots are a nice structure because it's two by two He's mainly been using bunkers and his wall wasn't even complete Why is he. What's he doing with his corruptors? I just wants to pee this base down, I guess You'd feel like there's a little bit more urgency if you're on two base and thirty-one workers, fighting against a guy that's on four base But there's no What? This is the scout, the scout pier This is what we used to do as well When I was a kid, I used to be on the scouts, okay? It's a good story, actually Used to be in the scout I think you call it like the Boy Scouts You know, the Boy Scouts And whenever you get to a train track when you're in the Dutch Boy Scouts, it is tradition that you all pee on the train track. Because you know it's supposed to be safe, right? Even if there's electricity on it, you shouldn't be able to feel it because the stream of your pee isn't consistent enough But always what you do, you first send in the youngest guy that's new to test if it's safe So he pees and if he's good, they all pee on the train track That's what this guy was as well The Boy Scout It's a standard procedure really in the Dutch Boy Scouts At least the chapter I was part of Okay, better cruisers make their way across the map take out the planetary fortress You love to see it It doesn't even like. What? You do whatever you want and still win? I'm really curious what Carl's response is going to be No chance at all for me to win This is just bad words he's using So bad at this game too sad get out i got to get out he won like this makes absolutely no sense you know let's go to the no before we go to the complaint form okay listen to this imagine this scenario a hypothetical okay completely hypothetical scenario imagine two people living next to each other shadow mantle and carl humus the famed philosopher now my man shadow mantle he wants to drink tea with some sugar in it okay just a little bit tea with some sugar in it. Except he's out of sugar So what does he do? He goes He goes to Carl He says, Carl, you dumb philosopher with lots of money, who is just lucky in life and got born to parents with high IQ I want some of your delicious sugar because your sugar is better, but only because you're lucky and an idiot Carl, calm as always says, sure, you can have some of my sugar Gives him a little sugar and as shadow mantle walks away He keeps on insulting, calling him a a mama's boy and a rich kid, even though Carl worked hard for his money And he tried his best He's a humble dude, tries to help anyone that comes to him for help. Shadow Mantle is just complaining, complaining Put some sugar in his tea, goes back through the rest of the sugar in Carl's face And Carl, he just takes it He breathes in through the nose and out through the mouth, because Carl knows that there's something wrong with Shadow Mantle Now, that is basically a complete analogy for what this game was We saw Carl being a complete gentleman, a scholar, someone that everyone would want as a friend While Shadow Mental did nothing but insult and play poorly and make mediocre decisions Now, from here on out, let's go into the balance complaint one more time Let's just go over some of the things he said. So first of all, he said, I probably lost a lot of drones, but I felt like I remade them pretty fast This is a claim that we can investigate We investigated This claim was simply not true You did lose a lot of drones, but you did not remake them pretty fast Like, that is absolutely not true That's a big X for you, my friend Like, it took you up until the 12 minimum wage, like 57 drones He didn't do any type of aggression that stopped you from building drones for the entire game All he did was send four widow mines into your mineral line that killed 45 workers somehow, and then completely ended you there You didn't rebuild them quickly. You didn't rebuild, but you did rebuild the drones that you initially lost, but you never built any more drones And also even the ones you rebuild were really slow So that is a false claim Second, thanks to Terran's incredibly easy early game defense, he can hold whatever early game push I might throw at him This is a claim that we tried to investigate but was impossible to investigate because you didn't throw anything at him There was no early game push You accidentally rallied 20 links into his natural and lost all of them, killing half an SUV If you consider that a push, we also this one out But honestly, this one is undecided We couldn't investigate this because no such thing happened. Impossible to investigate is what we say then At that point, I made lots of workers and was going into Hive, but he just decided to mindlessly mass battle cruisers I made lots of That is an objectively false claim You did not make lots of workers You did go into Hive and he did decide to make battle cruisers, whether that was mindless or not We can't really say So you know what? We'll give you partial true for this It takes no skill, no micro and he just gets insane value Nothing that you did Takes any scale, micro To be fair, you also had no value But you did nothing correct Nothing you did was with skill, nothing you did was with micro. And thus you also got no value He at least did some things correct He had correct unit counters He put on some aggression He built walls, even though they were kind of easy, I have to admit it, but depots, etc I mean, that's disgusting But he got way better value Yeah, he got way better value That's normal because you know what? Cirque is supposed to have a way better eco, but you didn't build any drone and he went down to 11 workers like the 5 minute mark So, in conclusion, were you correct in this balanced complaint form? No, no, none of the claims really hold through And on top of that, you sucked And you sucked extremely hard That's a fact. All right, that's going to be it for this episode Is it inbar, do we're stuck if you enjoyed this episode Don't forget subscribe to the YouTube channel Don't forget to say that you like me more than hamster and don't forget to smash the like button as well All of these things in that order Thanks so much for watching Bye-bye."

        "text": "Dear Harstam, I played against a turtle-terran who made a wall with planetary and built 348-204-823 turrets around his bases They just made defensive planetaries and turrets How am I ever supposed to attack into this? Widow minds being burrowed and unburrowed to chase and kill my tempest? Can we talk about BC's teleporting constantly? I am convinced TVP is unplayable I hope you come to conclusion that Terran is Inba Sincerely, a victim of Terran Name Moistchip XX, Race Protos, Leak Platinum, MMR 3 3 I know this player It is not your average prox player because this player happens to be my lovely girlfriend as well, going by the nickname of Moistchip XX, or chicken. She's complaining about, what was it again? turrets, planetaries, widow mines, BCs teleporting constantly, and TVP being unplayable in general So let's have a cheeky look, shall we? So this is going to be the first episode of, is it Inba or do I sleep on the couch? As we have here in the bottom right, the beautiful chicken, top left, Sid Luxor, Terran. player nasty of course builds planetary turrets makes battle cruisers it's not the type of guy you want to invite to your party in general don't invite terence to your parties constantly complaining that there's not enough salt in the food that you made this beer doesn't taste like there's any salt in it you know I need to keep my sodium high so I would not recommend inviting Terrence to your parties guys just scrolling through this game a little bit right just don't want to focus too much on the start because it seems like the juicy stuff is about to happen later on in the game just going to keep a close look on the build order here which seems to be fine 20 cybercore 20 nexus 21 pylon well 21 nexus i guess still it's a little late and it's a probe late and the pylon isn't being built at all but there's no probes being built before the gas either like this build order it isn't tight you know it isn't tight I'd recommend watching maybe one of my guides on how to open. Now it gets interesting You see a bunker being placed here Behind the mineral line Okay, Reaper comes in So this bunker is going to be quite annoying What are you doing, chicken? Okay, robo on the low ground I don't mind it I don't mind it Probeman tries to run away, dies Okay, now chicken is aware of the the bunker behind the mineral line What is the response here? So the correct response is single battery over here So you can shoot with the stalker while still being healed Or over here is also fine You can shoot from here And then just chronobust out of stalker Continue building probes, rally them into the main base. What are we seeing second gate? Second stalker should or the stalker should probably already be out at this point So it's a little bit late We see no probe production whatsoever So without this bunker doing anything, right now the worker count is basically even is really good for Terran because they have two mules Also, Terran is already mining from his natural You can also decide to send the Adeptor cross straight away once you see this and once your Stalker is out because Adept is kind of useless against this building anyway Like hardly there's any damage Stalker is taking its time still I feel like we haven't seen a worker being built in a past minute or so. Chrono Boost is an immortal and two batteries This is not a good response, okay? This is There used to be this guy who I think he started trading with like a red paper clip or something like that And then eventually he got like a, he kept trading it in for a thing every single time I feel like this is the start of one of those I think he ended up with like a four year record deal, right? Like a two million dollar villa or something like that after like a bunch of trades Like this is the first trade This dude invested a bunker which he salvaged and a Reaper and he got out of it. two batteries, a chrono-boasted immortal, and his opponent, forgetting to build probes for four minutes Like, that's one hell of a trade deal This, my man Sid Luxor, he didn't only read art of the deal Like, he wrote part of it People always wondered who the ghost rider was Now, we got him Mr Sid Luxor over here Congratulations New York Times bestseller And also an accomplished Starcraft player, apparently Now, walking into a cheeky supply block here as well as chicken gets the third gas. One of the good rules you can always follow is that you should never get your gases before you have at least 12 or 13 probes on the minerals in the natural or you're just going to be way under saturated on the minerals, especially I guess if you're going to be supply blocked for the duration that your gas is building We see Twilight, Robo Bay, no Chrono Boost usage We have a single pylon being used in a rather optimal way This pylon is powering absolutely every single building that is important Might want to add a second one Add the tasteless pylon to the artosis pylon there Observer, what's this observer going to show? This gas, of course, a very important gas. Important Assimilator to keep an eye on here. We also have one Observer on the other side. Siege Tank being built. Look at her. Look at her. Look at it. Well, I don't think this will be in vision range. Won't it be? This is definitely in vision range. Okay, you might want to move. You might want to move that unless Sid Luxur decides he's building a planetary on the natural. He's defending his lead that he got in the early game with the Bunker. He's still banking on that lead in the early game. Still banking on that early game lead. We now have a Colossus out. Do you have any scouting info? So we see a Starport with a Tech Lab. This indicates Benchie slash battle cruiser slash Raven At this point, you're probably expecting Mac as well if there's no like tech lab researching Stim yet like at least some Mackey composition There's two Benchies here already Let's see what the response is The response is putting the observer in observer mode completely against the side, so you only use half of the observer mode That's very, very smart It's a minimizing efficiency on this observer Rather than putting it here, where it still sees this side as well and also catches part of this, now you need probably double or triple the amount of observers if you place them like this That's absolutely brilliant You love to see it. this type of reverse efficiency i've heard of reverse engineering before but reverse efficiency is a new term that definitely can be used for this observer placement is luckily going to see the banshees take a look at this quick proto's response here responses to get another colossi and take a look at oh would you look at that pulls away the workers solid moves actually actually a good move you know what i can i can appreciate that then decides to it's not time yet to kill these These banshees, it might be better to protect the cybercore Ooh, the pylon! This is the most important pilot Oh no This is like the one ring in Lord of the Rings It's the one pylon. Once this one gets destroyed, it's all over No blink Managed to let the banshees out of here as well Do you want to send these pros back to work and get the pylon? The one pylon back in action? We meant Smeagle accidentally ate the ring here He needs to cuff it up Build that pylon Hello? Literally three production structures not doing anything What is our production? We have three gateways We have three gateways and one robo So 50% of our production and all of our upgrade structures right now aren't working This pylon, is that going to cover everything? I don't think it covers this gateway Could be wrong though I don't think it does Observer did it change position? Look at that. That's beautiful Okay So right now we see two more cc's being built We still have absolutely no clue what is happening, except that there's a tank here So far we've seen three units Well, four or five units One, two, three, four now And then the two Benchies that actually went back home again as well What's on the way? Is it battle cruisers? Okay, yeah, obviously it's going to be battle cruisers If you're not pre-ignited, we see more command centers Now, this looks very tricky, but we should not forget that whenever you see a planetary, you can't really, you can't easily attack into it So what you do instead is you just get a bunch of extra bases. You can delay the gases on your third base You just get a fourth base here You get a fifth base here You just get a crapped on of workers The thing is that chicken hasn't been doing that Chicken wants to win in a game of technology But she's behind in technology Right now, she's in the Bronze Age The other guys are thinking about nukes So in that case it's probably finally this one gets taken out It's been there for four minutes Like at this point you should be working at getting better economy, you know If you have one guy that has a button that can launch a nuke, you have 12 cavemen with bats, you're still going to be completely fine. Getting something like a zealette charge on immortal, maybe some stalkers in case of benchy, it's going to be completely fine And you can deny a fort base with that forever Now, it's only useful to deny a fort base if you yourself already have a fort base because otherwise you're just keeping the other person on the same amount of basis So you want to get up in economy and then deny outside bases It's going to be hard to attack into that I'll admit that even though you probably can cancel these At this point, you probably should be close to being maxed as a Protos player Okay? Not quite the case Colossi has double fleet beacon. Where are you? Once we're getting the Annie Impulse crystals and Flux Zanes at the same. same time very smart move something we don't see every day another gateway being added as well going up to a total number of four gateways maybe we can add another fleet beacon so we can also get the tectonic destabilizers the tempest upgrade going at the same time feel like that would really add something here 68 workers 138 army supply double fleet beacon amazing three cannons at the fourth base because we really saw a lot of aggression coming from our opponent who had three tanks and a banshee one cannon would have been enough could have already been on five six bases 90 workers i would have been maxed seven times at this point and then your main goal is denying the fort base before it turns into a planetary even though even if a fort turns into a planetary it's very difficult for the terran to basically get a solid defense there as well because he just doesn't have enough units. He's getting four more command centers in the main base and more turrets All of these turrets is basically money that he isn't spending on units or economy or bases So every time you see three turrets, that's a free nexus for you Okay Three, four turrets And every time you see a planetary at a random location, that's another free nexus for you So at the start, we already saw planetary here That was a free nexus. We saw like 17 freaking turrets everywhere so that's another like five nexus like you could have actually been eight base against three base and just constantly focus on denying that outside base right now this is the timing to attack okay you don't need to do anything else just attack at this point kill this fourth base make sure it doesn't go up you have enough to burst down your 170 supply still only on plus one by the way 12 minutes into the game absolutely no vision like the vision of a freaking mole I like the run by attempt here I'm not sure where over here, thinks the fort base is being taken here. Probably should just have an observer here, have an observer here, have an observer here at this point as well And from there on out, you can probably do whatever you want 36 workers on this base is pushing it a little bit I mean, there's actually no defense Like, planetaries are good, but they're not that good, you know? They're actually not that good at all Still on 4 base here for Chicken, who really hasn't been doing anything for the past five minutes, except building workers and sitting back Now she hits max Let's see what the plans are when maxed This is always a big moment in lower level games. It's when the supply hits 200 because now something needs to be done that isn't building more units Okay, run by So that's a big planetary Five turrets Looks at her army Maybe fifth base now Two more tempest on the way Chrono boost everything a little bit Because now there's nothing to be done anymore Like it's over You know, you're complete. So what is it you start doing? usually you start attacking or at least start thinking about what you could be doing maybe get some more vision on the map doesn't quite seem to be the case intense focus on this pylon finishing making sure the nexus is still building this is the the micromanaging manager you know what i mean this is the guy that stands behind you on your pc as you're as you're trying to craft together your your newest thumbnail for your new youtube video That's what I do with Hamster as well every single time He always has to share screen when he's working so I can complain about things Now Hamster, I think it would be better to go like this. That's what she's doing is it's looking Pilons built Look at Pylumsville There we go See seven battle cruisers move through And again, it's a good time to move out with a small part of my army Goes to defend against the battle cruisers with four zealots, five four zealots, five stalkers and a carrier, and then leaves five carriers and two tempest into the natural No Now grabs another, it leaves these two carriers here in case a helion run by hits the natural or something Okay, these immortals die Well, they just get F-2ed back home They were going to die to the bansies, though Barrow Cruiser's teleport Teleport to the other side. Now we could use a recall here, but we could also go for the slow, of walking there all the way or in this case flying I guess we already know what's going to be happening oh recall as the Nexus dies it's another solid call wait always wait till the last second with your recall makes the game more exciting gives the charon a chance to escape as well very brilliant move you love to see it by the way I think we should have a little bit of a battle cruiser teleport counter so so far we've seen a single teleport 15 minutes into the game okay often when people say they're going crazy because of battle cruiser teleports, what really happens is they teleport once or twice, they get caught completely out of position, they forget they have the recall ability, they have no map vision whatsoever, and they die. Now, one good thing you can do against battle cruisers is to have vision everywhere, because battle cruisers can only teleport once So imagine you have vision on this side over here with like a pylon or whatever You see the battle cruiser there you can just go to those battle cruisers and then if they teleport anywhere else into your base, you will kill them They can't escape anymore And that's kind of the beauty You can also use oracles to tag your opponent's battle cruisers to see where they are going You can use observers for vision You can use a mothership for getting a second recall First of all, for having offensive recalls Oh, that's a couple of mines. We have an observer with our army Now, you see right now that there's like six mines, it might be wise to get something like a disruptor to deal with these mines Okay One or two disruptors help so much Otherwise, the mines will just be able to walk underneath your units Now, this is, I want to go back here This should never happen The moment the battle cruisers are near, you should be aware of that and you should start shooting them with your tempest Okay That is the main goal of the tempest, is that they have long range That's why an Oracle is so important with it. can use revelation on your opponent's army and you can just shoot from a distance and that's you know from a distance so you use a separate control group now this is a foreign concept for a lot of people separate control groups but you do use separate control groups and you use just the tempest to go from a distance and then your opponent either needs to fly away or attack into you but you already will kill two three battle cruisers before he even arrives at your army now once again disruptor here would be fantastic um Another thing that would be fantastic is if you'd have the tectonic destabilizer that helps your tempest do like five times the damage to buildings. Would actually be relatively helpful Oh my god, the only detection you have dice This is fantastic Oh, see how good tempest are here? Look at the power of the tempest It's absolutely destroying these battle cruisers Now it would be even better once again if you could actually see them from a distance So you could continue shooting If you could see these mines, you could continue shooting those rather than waiting them to get their recharge and then shooting again at all of your interceptors Five more battle cruisers are on the way I love that chicken decides to attack every single planetary except the one that makes sure that mining is possible It's like, oh, I feel like this orbital command that can fly away. It's probably more important to attack than this planetary Okay, now that we killed all of the useless planetaries and all of the useless orbitals, Let me just fly to a different base to see if we can kill any planetaries there Yep, there we go, absolutely beautiful That is a job well done Truly a job well done Oh, taking out the turrets Maybe take out this tank as well and you can go to this base There's still a few turrets and an orbital over there that you could potentially take out Oh, now it gets distracted This is like seeing a cat on a mission and like turrets and useless planetaries are like the lasers, you know. Like this cat is on a mission with oh actually we might get one there's no way right click it right click it Nice that's one only took us five planetaries 15 turrets and our own dead base to to truly get it going Here comes a little bit of a Thor rally another classic We still have no observer with this army by the way I was gonna say when do the mines show up for the firework ship? There we go So beautiful This is why I get a disruptor One disruptor or two disruptors absolutely deal with this problem Tectonic destabilizers really would have made this process a lot quicker. Don't forget that even though Chicken right now is killing a bunch of bases and is doing quite well, chicken also is losing every single probe on our own side of the map against three battle cruisers that teleported Now you could have said you could have warped in 15 stalkers and dealt with this You could have recalled back home five tempest and dealt with this But another option, which is an option, I do kind of want to state this, this is an option that very often doesn't get shown in higher level games, and people don't really tend to talk about it too much either. And there is the third option where instead of actually dealing with the problem, you just kind of pretend that the problem doesn't exist People tend to do this with their in-laws, people they don't like at work. you know you just kind of pretend the person or a problem doesn't exist and hopefully it will go away I've been doing that with my taxes for the past five years so far they've taken my car all of my computer gear I hit this one in the closet so I can still record some videos but one day as long as I keep imagining hard enough I do hope that the taxman will indefinitely go away and when that day hits I will tell you you guys that this strategy for the first time ever actually was successful. Because I really do think in this case it probably would have been better to just warp in 10 stalkers rather than losing two bases and losing 40 probes You also probably could have pulled away some of the workers to another base like this one, but I guess that will be required two actions Selecting the probes and then clicking on the mini map and then right clicking here That does sound like a lot of trouble I think just letting those bases die probably was better This kind of scares me for my future, you know, like getting a pet or something like that The pet is sick, you know, just let it be, it will fix itself. Like, it's going to be a major yikes there, guys That's a scary prospect Even worse if I am sick and she'll just like, oh, well, you'll probably get better by himself Oh, this is a good warpin as well The zealad warpin valied into the battle cruisers Very smart Zellet, probably the only unit that you still want to build at this point that can't shoot up Instead, will be rallied into two planetaries and 15 turrets Some solid harass now realizes that there still is two planetaries No, actually, that doesn't deter her, decides to still send them in Plenty of money anyway Let's see how good this trade was So far, we've killed nothing, and we've lost seven zealots. This guy, he saw his maids going He's like, ah, not that they may This is the biologist of the bunch He is studying the plants Oh, that looks real nice That looks real nice over here, guys She's the mules crawl from the sky to planetary It's like, oh, this beautiful Pretend that there's some interesting bugs in there, endangered species Nice try, buddy So now the mining is looking pretty equal in terms of income The army composition actually is very, very good for chicken It's so many tempas The only thing we're really missing is anything to deal with the mines which have been a major issue Unit Lostab is pretty close as well Probably want to be getting a couple of probes. Actually, we have plenty of probes We just need another base Or probably need to send a probe to the correct base Overworking Once again, efficiency is key here The reverse efficiency, as I had coined that term Oh, Zella decides now is the time That probably wasn't F2A move I'm going to guess that wasn't F2A move Is there any units anywhere else? Let me have some tempest here. so maybe it wasn't like actually the Tectonic Destabilizers would have been really nice this game the amount of buildings that have gone down on the Terran side and the amount of buildings that could have gone down probably i don't even sure how much extra damage it does but it feels like you can basically like two shot Planetary Fortresses with this amount of Tempests once you get Tectonic Destabilizers i mean Chicken's army is still looking super solid just super super solid the income is also actually better than the opponents we're just missing missing Disruptors maybe like some ground arm even just a couple of Stalkers and then one two Disruptors even two three Colossi would be sick against these Widow Mines like this this air army is never going to kill those Tempests right there's three Thors and what ten Battlecruisers yeah that's just game continuing to attack every single turret now taking out Refineries as well rather than going from mining basis. I guess if you have absolutely no clue that there's a mining base, then this probably is the correct call to make It's very, very smart Just by getting very little information, you can't be blamed for making incorrect calls, because you can always just say, well, I had, I didn't know that, you know It's kind of the trick that our government has been using for a while as well It's a nice on Maybe chicken has a good future in politics Oh, here come the mines now aware of the mines once again No observer with this because you wouldn't want to accidentally see the mines Once again, if you can't see the problem, the problem isn't really there Very, very nice. Are we going to see a recall or are we going to go for the same strategy as earlier? It seems like, once again, a similar approach as earlier Now, this time, oh, we actually have some tempest in the main base that probably were semi-forgotten This is going to do very well against these battle cruisers Maybe we want to use these three. well but then again you probably oh right at these guys teleport I mean not a bad fight once again for chicken still having some issues with these mines yeah maybe one just get an observer maybe you don't even need a disruptor but just being able to see them would be nice now teleport to the other side I feel like this is the second teleport we've seen so far yeah this must be making you crazy all of these teleports that's insane 23 workers right now so you would feel that there might be some urgency behind the gameplay of chicken chicken is down 40 workers is on half a mining base there's now as many probes long distance mining this base as there is mining this one there's as many probes oversaturating this gas as there's probes mining this base You love to see it. Any extra probes? I might just want to build a couple extra probes You still have 3,600 minerals and you have like 5 necksize, so you can actually still build probes at a very rapid speed Probably could have been back at like 50 at this point if you would have continued doing that Now, solid map vision once again out of chicken, making sure that none of the threats are being perceived before they actually arrive at the base Very, very good What is this? 17 Tempest Against seven Vikings and five battle cruisers Now if you could see this army move in, it probably wouldn't be too much of an issue I mean, these halberts don't do too much. Once again, a single disruptor would take care of the massive issue that those mines are Instead, oh, don't recall into this Okay, thank God there's no recall I wouldn't have put it past chicken, honestly Thor's taking out of the simulator Zellas going in ahead of the army, smart Oh I like that there's like eight, no, come on Oh, there's a second one He's the backup observer That's a legendary move, honestly Yeah, I wonder how this fight will go Oh, teleports out Mines, mines, I mean, not a bad fight The problem that I have here, though, for chicken, is that there seems to be no sense of Okay, it's a good recall, actually I like that recall And there's nothing wrong with that. See, this is what Okay, this is the third teleport, by the way This is why these teleports aren't that good if you do them aggressively Let me see three more battle crews are being ready into this Might want to focus fire a little bit on one of them I like that all the damage is split to make sure that all of the Yamato's go off Oh, there we go I want to right click this? Yep, there we're okay So that was a six tempest trade against three battle cruisers and only get two of them Then the tempest go here I feel like chicken would realize now that the sensor tower has been built or that there might be a base. The chicken actually think that this was it after these two top bases, like, oh, cleaned up part of the problem We'll be fine from now 10 workers left now is the time to start rebuilding workers again smart the type of intelligent play you you kind of expect after seeing the rest of the game play three tempest six it's gonna make a total of 10 I feel like these eight mines will be good enough because there's no observer anymore I think pure mine okay come come chicken move forward oh dang flabit more turrets let me just stand in turret range as well Longest range unit in the game still managed to fly into turret range It has to be an ability as well. Chicken make one hell of a superhero Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da I'm always in range of whatever's trying to shoot me Actually lose to a shotgun while having a sniper rifle Right clicks the refinery I mean, Army is still nice and maybe if there was some kiting or, you know, just any micro whatsoever, that would be Was that stutter-stapping with Tempest? Let's do that in the replay Look at this Realizing the Vikings are going to retreat, chicken flies in to stutter-stap already, pre-empting the fly-away That's a high-level move That is high level, honestly I don't care The rest of the game, I don't even care anymore This is brilliant Oh, here come the mines The mines probably have done the most so far this game. You might want to turn around, shoot them Hello? Yes, shoot the one that already fired The only one that, yeah, go back to SDVs You love to see it Poof Poof Very unfortunate Again, no vision maybe want to get another backup boy let me see our terran kind of realizes he's so far ahead doesn't even care about producing anymore he does he love this he's 6k 2k in the bank his priority is getting a refinery rather than producing some units that's when you know you're confident you know if chicken had done this we would have called it bad because it's the terran we know it's confidence utter confidence yes two minds blocking his CC as well Double planetary turrets over here. I love this play style by the way This is great to see This is why I like watching lower level games as well because you know, you just see these things and you're like, yeah, that's freaking cool That's actually a robotics facility I lost the robotics facility Can't build observers anymore Maybe we could consider getting an Oracle finally So what have we lost so far this game? 35 Tempest, eight carriers What has the term on so far this game? 30 battle-cliac cruisers, eight tours, 25 mines Still 17 mines here The Terran army actually is looking pretty weak right now. But after Chickens realized that there was a base here and probably a base here, and at this point probably bases everywhere again, chicken decided that the longer the game goes, it might be better because there's more minerals available on chicken side of the map Look here Still have lots of minerals here The other guys are mining out faster So even though you're being outmined about 10-fold, this is really quite smart And they always say slow and steady wins the race But I have a feeling that chicken is going so slow and steady that we might never see the end of this game If chicken were to win this race Moves in, I'm afraid of these eight mines. Once again, there's a planetary that's not mining Of course, it gets priority over everything else that's happening on the map Wait, we actually have two to revelators Is this the first time we get these? That's beautiful That's just beautiful That's absolutely amazing Why is our Terran just not building anything? Maybe he went to get like a beer or something like that Now he's just watching the game unfold Look at this The chick is going to fly into my minds one more time We make a planetary out of this as well What's the APM of the Terran currently? I think he's actually just playing with one hand or just scrolling around the map He's just looking at things. Like he doesn't give a crap whether this is being taken out or not This chick is probably going to take out the turrets in this planetarian and move on towards this one because it's not mining anymore Take out these two refineries Wouldn't want to actually try to deny any real mining This is fantastic Oh, we have some units being produced That's an issue That's a real issue I can't believe this game is still going on though on though What's the mine count currently? 15 Absolutely beautiful Okay, base actually does get taken out You love to see it See how the rest of these tempers are oh These two refineries of course wouldn't want any long distance mining going down. Well here there's still a bunch of refineries mining regular distance mining Tempus go on to the next planetary that isn't mining Maybe take out these refineries Yep there of course there's a turret behind there that could potentially be annoying. Imagine for example if you want to send a prism down here into these turrets so you're like I don't want to lose my prison to these but these might kill it and I think it's a good call to take out these turrets and also kill the refinery so they don't get spotted chicken disagrees for whatever reason but in another dimension I could have seen it happen now attacks with full confidence into this army doesn't use the revelation so not really utilizing the complete range of the Tempest for the 32nd minutes straight in this game so far stasis words also could have helped against the mines by the way yeah so the mines explode and i guess that's actually just going the terran jiegeet hi this guy's this guy is a prick but that guy's a prick i don't like that i did that was a nice it luxury okay you should have you wore already. All right You destroy chicken You should have left it with that buddy You should have left it with that But, but yeah, let's think about the game Let's think about that initial What did it say again? The imbalance complained for him Play against a turtle tariff made a wall with a planetary I mean, it wasn't really a wall I'm wondering if this is considered an easy wall I think this would be considered an easy wall Yeah, that was an easy wall with a planetary and a bunch of turrets To be precise, 3482-904-8 Is that trillion? Three trillion turrets They just made defensive planetaries and turrets Chicken maybe thinks it's multiple people They just made defensive planetaries and turrets Nice. How am I ever supposed to attack into this? Widow minds being burrowed and unburrowed to chase and kill my thames I don't think there was a lot of chasing going on This was more of a static movement You know, like, just where I'm not sure if you call it chasing if the person you're chasing is standing still It's like, I got chased by someone with a knife And then if you don't run away, is it really a chase or is it just coming up to you? I felt like the minds were more coming up to you because I don't think there was a single time where you actually ran away, which once again, it scares me for your life in real life. What happens if you actually will get chased by someone? would you go help i'm being chased please stop chasing me is like well you're not really moving it's just coming up to you um it's maybe something to work on there um riddle minds being burrowed the numbers okay can we talk about bccease teleporting i think we counted three teleports maybe four maybe i missed one i don't know counting like i said after i got kicked out of elementary school never quite recovered from there but i think somewhere around three and four So yeah, I don't think it is And that leads me to this one thing I am sorry to say, but you leave me absolutely no choice. You, my friend, you just really freaking Dear YouTube, I am doing fine I'm being loved, treated with respect, and I'm being fed daily as well I'm currently at an undisclosed location Do not look for me I went here voluntarily and I do not wish to be found right now The reason I went here is because I was about to make a big mistake and called a game that chicken played a suck on her part Well now I realized that this is actually extremely imbalanced I cannot say anything else except yes this is in balance I have my own reasons for this And there are very good reasons for me to say this right now Please once again do not look for me. I am doing fine Thank you for watching."

I can believe Amazon deliver stuff into cage these days, but I mean, it's not the greatest things, but I've got myself a little setup here Let me see if I still know how this stuff works It's so bright In balance complaint form I have a vague memory of doing this in the past Headset, microphone In balance complaint form? Let's go He had 59 queens 59 Queens are OP They make units They attack air They attack air They attack ground They heal stuff They make everything else faster Investors are invisible when burrowed and steal your units Triple exclamation mark The most imba zirk composition for the most in by race. Zirk is the most in by race combined with mass queens and investor This is the most broken composition Name, simply yellow, race, Protoz Leak, diamond on the NA server And guess what, guys? I have this replay It was attached with the email Let's all straight into it Oh, that's too many times speed So we have in the bottom left, our main man, yellow pink He says queens are too strong His opponent built 59 queens 59 So a 59 queen army with investors That doesn't sound all too bad Queens attack air They hue everything The investors, they take over your opponent's army Investors are only two supply each, but they can take over a six supply army You add all of these facts together. This sounds pretty freaking broken Hamster End it End the show Back to sleep Put the big imba stamp on it Queens are completely broken Boom Congratulations No, just kidding, guys We're going to watch this replay I'll watch this replay. And we're going to figure out exactly what went wrong here for Yellow Pink, whether this game is actually imbalanced or if perhaps there was something that he could have done better i know it sounds unlikely as unlikely as getting an espresso machine ordered to your cave but some some good cave coffee right there my friends that's some good cave coffee we have uh yellow pink move we have the first probe it's going to go for a cheeky scout see what the opponent is up to this opponent is not up too much you know we have the barcodes right i always love seeing barcodes at diamond level It's like no one even knows your real name and here you are playing under a barcode. Like what is the point? Actually what is the point of barcoding when your diamond? It's like trying to hide the fact that you're floating 500 minerals at the three-minute mark Like let's be really where my friend No one cares Okay The other guy probably doesn't even know how to upload a replay hat or to open a replay hat So it's not like they're gonna be capable of you know actually seeing what you did wrong All right So he He pops in his hat He's like, I've seen everything I need to see I've seen the hatchery I've seen that there's a pool and a gas And now it's time to get back home. Now, ideally, you also check the timing of the links popping out You want to see if there's a third base with your probe But honestly, these are all other details He just wants to figure out, hey, am I being 12-pulled or 16-pooled? And my cave keyboard has the keys falling off Nice And then he just wants to go home with his probe Okay, that's it And that's fair It's completely right This is a fine way to do it Sure, you don't get as much information, but you get the most important information And part of that information is, hey, am I going to die in the next three seconds? And the answer here was no So, you know, I don't mind. It's going to go for a robo here, Yellow Pink Very rare to see robotics facilities being played in this matchup Usually it's all Stargate at the high level, but not today So we're seeing a robotics facility come out We have Yellow Pink going to be taking a third base here as well So it's all looking pretty tight It's all looking pretty solid here I do like that I do really like that This overlord's going to get taken out or at least going to be attacked a little bit It's going to hide I don't think you can see it on top of this dome, right? I want to read a book by Stephen King called Under the Dome Fantastic first 700 pages. Then like page 700, he introduces some aliens or something like that It's like, well, I wasn't into that, Stephen Send him an email, but he never replied It's a bit like Stan. didn't drive of a bridge so slightly different immortal sentry stalker I mean this is a build order I guess he's up three workers as well somehow not quite sure how that happened he also said something in the in the imbalance ticket by the way I want to come back he said queens produce units that's not quite true queens produce larva and the larva produce units okay it's a it's an added macro mechanic I think that's the one thing you shouldn't complain about because if they wouldn't have that, there would just be extra larvae spawning automatically So we wouldn't want to make the game easier for Zerk. So whenever people complain about the Queen, I never tell them to complain about the inject ability because they still need those larvae. So either they will need to manually inject it or the Hatchery automatically does it. And then in that case, I'd rather have them have to manually do it, you know? So this guy's actually using his Queens pretty well, spreading some creep already. For the level that we're on, I like these first two three Creep Tumors, I guess, the two active Creep Tumors but this is looking pretty solid. It's a good Roach Warren timing as well. Maybe a little bit late for the fact that there is no Stargate unit. He sees double Sentry. I think he pretty much knows what's up now, right? It's going to be a two-based immortal push Like, yeah, everything, this just smells immortal push This is 100% going to be an immortal push So it's getting a spine crawler He's going to get more queens, which actually is a good answer I do like that He already has six, but he's going to get at least one more I wouldn't mind if he gets a second one as well So this Zirk player is, you know, he's scouting things, he's responding to his opponent, he sacrificed a couple of links, saw what his opponent's doing, tried to even sacrifice the overlord He's building spines now He's like, okay, all I need to do is just survive. I'm up a base, I'm going to be up a couple of workers Like, what is the worst thing that can happen? Does he have speed? He has speed I wouldn't mind if he keeps a ling over here on the third base, though, and just another link to see, hey, is my opponent moving out yet The Evo chamber, I'm not a massive fan of either, but, you know, you can't have it all Sporkrother also confuses me Okay, so our ProDos player is actually completely setting up here for an immortal push Should be building a prism as well already, which he is not doing it Oh, there we go Prism This is what, 8 gate, 7 gate, 7 gate, 7 gate, immortal push. I used to do this build a lot back in 2018, except I would have already been attacking at this point I probably had collected the big fat dub, but yellow pink takes it a little bit slower And that's okay, of course I mean, at this level, that's normal We do see two more queens on the way I'm starting to see where the issue is We're now at nine queens total Okay, okay. Creep shreds not looking too healthy yet It's getting a battery so when he moves out he can't get counter-attack His opponent is building roaches Okay, he's getting stalkers Now I wouldn't mind see there we go finally we get the move out so my man yellow pink starts moving out across the map and hopefully we'll be able to Do a little bit of damage We'll see if it actually ends up working like that And this jerk is really not playing poorly look at this Yes like the the run-by stuff ready Look at that's going to go for the stalker here, but there's a battery, so actually while taking care of both of these guys having some nice moves anticipating what their opponent is doing. I actually think that this is a decent chance of working There's three immortals against nine roaches Could you get a force field, perhaps? No force field, okay, no force field, two, three, five Some force fields, I guess I'm not quite sure what happened in this fight, but he lost all of his sentries and got absolutely nothing done I want to see this fighting What was he attacking? I feel like he just killed the rocks or something This was a very confusing fight for me Okay So first of all, I would suggest taking out these rocks So you have a little bit more space for your army to maneuver towards. Then if you look, whenever you have this type of scenario, you want to look at the areas where you can force This looks like an area with potential This is what one, two, three, four, four fields or so, okay? fields or so, okay? So position your army here and you force-shoot it up, you can take out the spine crawler His stab what we're seeing here is, so he's just, he eats a bile completely, then he force fields, but doesn't actually use his force fields at all He loses all of his sentries, or almost all of his sentries, and kills a single roach I think he killed a roach and aiding, and lost like five sentries. His immortals aren't attacking half the time, and when they're attacking them are always attacking links So this opponent just has a perfect tool Don't forget Our opponent scouted everything, stopped droning at the exact correct amount, and actually microdisc unit He threw down Biles, he transfused, he used the links for a flank This guy lost a prism as well Okay, this game is just over He completely butchered a two-base all-in He did it on a map where it's not even good, and then he also butchered the micro, completely. He's down 10 workers, his opponent has good crew spread, upper base has 12 more workers or 10 more workers or something like that this game just ended okay this is actually game over the game is this is it this is just it it's gonna get a nexus this is like the type of expand i do as well but i usually do it when i'm winning so if you're two base this is a quick tip this is a quick tip for you guys at home there are you tired of every other race calling you a two base all-inner or a dirty pros of cheezer i am very tired of that personally so what I do is whenever I'm all-inning my opponent I always make sure that when I think he's about to leave the game I build two necksi at the same time so when they look they open like they press the rewind button and they see like four dots on the menu up like oh it was a four-base all-in that's weird that I lost to that I only had three bases I bet his macro must have been amazing a quick tip for you guys okay very smart back back into the game third base he's doing it the other way around as he's losing he's pretending that he was playing a macro game I like doing that as well I can't believe I lost another macro game against Zirk that you added into your massive file you have lost macro games against Zirk then whenever there's a balance argument going on you pull out the big document with timestamps it always works very well I have a lot of Zirk friends friends still left over about two next on the third base it's going there now I'm loving the scouting that's going on right now from Yellow Pink. Yellow Pink attacked about a minute and a half ago and ever since then decided to completely give up on scouting and just blindly start fighting the units that he saw last Okay? Now this is actually brilliant because what other information do we have except what we saw less? Well we could maybe scout or for buildings or we could check what's popping out of the larvae or we could look for the army Very often you can scout through aggression So you send in like two adepts from this side You try to kill four workers or so And at the same time, whatever unit shows their face to you, you'll know that these are being built. Right now, it's actually funny because the Protos is countering the correct units But that's just purely by luck He could have been countering the completely wrong units Like right now he's thinking, oh, I saw roaches last He's probably just going to keep building roaches, which he could have thrown down a spire like a minute ago and been on eight, And there would be 12 muras flying into your base in about three seconds And at that point, you would have had eight stalkers without blink, two immortals, storm, thermal lands, and a colossi on the way, which is fantastic. This is kind of like, if you're a government, and there's been some natural disasters, okay? So you're an island and you're surrounded by water, which is inherent to most islands You're surrounded by water, okay? And you've been struggling with floods, okay? But you're also on one of these things where a lot of earthquake happens, except you've never experienced an earthquake yet Now, if you're a government and you've only dealt with floods yet, it makes sense to invest in something that can deal with the floods So dykes, or you rent Dutch people to hold back the water with their tall heads or something. I don't know what you do against water, but I know that people like to hire Dutch people to deal with it They're tall However, there's still a possibility that there's going to be an earthquake So as a government, you need to anticipate that And it's the same thing in StarCraft 2 here We need to anticipate the earthquake that Muras could cause in our proto society Our friend is not doing that Hell, he's not even researching if there's a possibility of earthquakes He's la la la, la, he's going to flood the water's gonna flood He's like, I'm an island What's the worst that's gonna happen? Well, it can be pretty bad, my friend. So always make sure that you know what are the incoming natural disasters, like what could be happening soon And that is not just looking at the past, but also trying to research what's about to happen into the future Just because something hasn't happened yet doesn't mean that it won't happen So for example, if you have a national pandemic emergency response team and you decide to defund that in 2017, and then a massive pandemic breaks out in 2020 Yeah, that would be extremely unfortunate That's bad governmental decision making But here, luckily, it works out well This is like taking out some type of pandemic team and then realising. that there's never going to be a pandemic in the term that you're sitting as a president You'd be pretty freaking lucky if that happens And this cave coffee is ridiculously good Amazon really delivers everywhere these days Two more immortals, because with all the information that we have, that seems like a great call For all this guy knows, our opponent is still on a single gas Really, you can only build links So colossi immortal sounds like a brilliant plan This guy's really spreading some creep I feel like after that first attack, not much has happened. Sometimes I look at these games and I think, you know, you know how StarCraft is always kind of lauded as one of these difficult games, you know, like a true test of skill and a high level and difficult and things like that And I'm like, yeah, that's true And maybe sometimes that isn't just for everyone, you know? Perhaps Yellow Pink would be more suited to play something like Sim City, you know, or the Sims Just a game where it's more relaxing you're playing against a computer opponent rather than against an actual opponent, someone that might fight back You know, just play a game that is just more relaxing where you can just build up bases, you know, you can do things. There are some natural disasters happening, but if it doesn't go well, you just go back to an older load, like an older safe file Because honestly, this just doesn't seem to be your speed, if you know what I'm saying Like you're just, if you're just like building things, it's okay to play roller coaster tycoon It's fine It's fine to try to build a zoo in zoo tycoon, okay? To create an alternative life in Sims 4 or Sims 5, whatever is the most recent Sims with the Dream Night expansion This is the one thing that always fist me off with Sims You had a stupid game, and then Sims 2 has like 17 different expansions. Of course, you weren't one of the cool kids if you didn't have all 17 of them So as a kid, I really blessed that line wire with SIM expansion packs downloads I mean, I bought all of my SIM expansion packs in the local game store Using Linewire to download LineWire Pro really was a flex I remember that Those were the legendary days I miss that I really do miss that I wish Linewire was still around I really killed it off So, I mean, the Scouting, like I said, still has been ruined Really, he doesn't even know if this gas finished or not Theoretically, the barcode Zerk could still be on zero gas, and it was a fake gas He has no clue. The only reason he knows is because he saw a couple of roaches, okay? This is brilliant There's a spire Imagine if five Brutelords would show up right now What would our hero do? He has eight stalkers with blink He hasn't actually seen his opponent's army His opponent's army, look at the amount of stuff he has and the amount of revergerage built I think he might probably somewhere around 3,200 gas since the last time that Yellow Pink saw this army That could have been like legit 33 mudas or like 10, 12 brute lords Or just bailings in your mineral line and because you don't have nothing in the wall, you lose all your workers This is a great army split I love this. Just making sure that you cover both paths Smart Okay This is a brilliant engagement A couple of piles hitting everything that they could have hit I mean the army is just massive though and I actually think the Zerg is pretty good. that here so what you do is you throw a couple of storms you try to not eat every bile possible do you ever play these games like where you had to dodge things it's like it's like these games you had on on the on the Wii or something like that there initially was a thing where it was like a webcam you could like dodge things like I can't remember if it was weird slash things whatever it's similar here except yellow pink instead of dodging everything, in this case the bells, he just catches everything, just with his head, you know He'd be a great game to play Dodge the Ninja Star with. I think you'd have a great quick trip to the hospital if you'd play it with him, because he's just catching everything that hurts him I think he actually ate every single bile that's possible Look at this He really is maximizing the damage output Oh, that was two missed ones Three missed bios we've seen out of 136 bios thrown so far. he managed to eat almost all of them he was going for the triple whammy bonus score a couple more yep walk the immortals in maybe also lose your templars to these next piles maybe so you can't storm anymore how is this possible he actually is hitting everything okay you just store I love that he moved command had a little more to maximize the potential of his opponents I can't believe he lost that army against this army I had terrible upgrades Oh, actually Holy crap So what has he been doing? It's just been building? Twelve gateways? I mean, he hasn't even really spending his money He also wasn't controlling his army I hate doing this, but I'm just so curious. He does this really strong slow just sitting looking at things what is he looking at it wait what did you they just chrono boost his Nexus oh no wait wait oh cromboos the forge a couple of stargates more probes okay oh man this speed this is that makes you fall asleep at night and waiting for the next action you know, you might just fall asleep in between It's like watching the Super Bowl, but instead of not doing any actions, it's commercials rather than actual action Classic Super Bowl This is a great run by as well He's going to get every single probe, isn't he? Oh yeah, he's going to get every single probe. By the way, wasn't a complaint about investors and queens? He's eight queens so far He lost three That's 11 What did he say? 59? 59 queens 59 divided by 11 That's 5 3 He was over a ratio of 5 3 I bet if this guy says that he has a 12 inch, you can't be real disappointed Yeah, don't Trust me, babe It's massive Poor guy Poor yellow pig Where this guy He doesn't know how to do basic math No, no, no, no, no, no, basic calculations here, my friends It's getting plus two though I mean, he's allowed to He only has a 4K, 2K bank So he didn't even lose to Queens. Does the other guy even research neural parasite? Did he even build an Infestor? Maybe he sent the wrong replay and he was pretty proud of his own is it possible that he sent the wrong replay it is possible that he sent the incorrect replay 19 Lurkers I mean this looks more like a Lurker complainer but to me you know what truly is the point here doesn't even burrow the Lurkers That's got to be triggering See that doesn't have a hotkey for a Lurker burrow I mean, doesn't he just walk in and kill everything? His map vision has been fantastic as well, by the way Look at that He's really seeing everything that he can He has Creep Tumors pushing into his fifth base. He's no clue that there's an army waiting for him What's the response here? I actually wonder what you do I think you just attack the other guy. like this position you're not going to win it anymore you know you just kind of give up at like you send your templar over here you attack with your army to the other side of the map he's building carriers now it's getting plus one upgrades for them i mean you're gonna need what is this three three yeah three you're gonna need like better upgrades on carriers at least plus two in order to do any type of damage this jerk didn't play poorly though he's taking nice position look at his crease red guys that's so crazy yeah i'm no expert at this game No, actually, I have an expert at this game, and this fight is not going to be a for the boss. Yeah, it's a big surprise there Attacking into, like, a ramped position with 19 lurkers, and they're still stalkers in your army, that's usually not going to meet You're either going to need disruptors or carriers or like Tempest or something Like either air units, so the lurkers can shoot you, or you're going to need disruptors, or you're not going to break this type of army It's just simply not possible, guys It's simply not possible Now he's down 80 supply He sees it He sees everything He's absolutely no clue what's happening in his game He's opponents on six bases Maybe he thinks lurkers are queens It's like a transformation of the queen I hadn't even considered it Maybe he doesn't know how lurkers are made. Like he also still believes that the stork brings the babies and it does by the way it does bring the bit of the stork eight lurkers maybe maybe he thinks every range unit in the Zerk army comes from the queen and it's like a morph like the bainling you want the hydra you just more of a queen like you feed it 50 gas or something you inject the gas into the queen it turns into a hydra and then you give it 50 more gas it turns it to a lurker So every unit is really a queen Is that what happened there? Okay, let's do some counting The roach doesn't come from the queen Four hydras, 11 lurkers, and three queens have died. That's 4 plus 11 is 15, 18 Then there's eight more queens 26 29 plus 26 is 55 and then eight lurkers that is 58 he said 59 I think we figured it out he actually thinks every ranged unit he thinks every range unit is a queen if the game ends now this would be it he just miscounted by one or I miscounted by one Every ground range unit is a queen This is brilliant This was A swing and a hit This happens rarely where I actually figured out He just doesn't know how Zirk works Does he think that Overlords morph into Vipers? I'm gonna get an email next week complaining about Overlords He had 700 Overlords. How does he? think links are made? I'm so curious now I am so extremely curious This game is going to end and I'm going to be right with my 58 My theory worked out Maybe it's drones Links turn into melee units That's it Ten, eleven, three, twenty-four. He still had 23 alive and then 8 plus 8 I think I think we actually figured it out I feel a bit bad now for making fun of his size but I think this might be it he just doesn't know how the game works should I just make like a I'll make a basic guide on how Zirk units work for you okay upcoming Monday or so I'll just explain to you the evolutions and the transformations we just go over all the units in the game and then what's his name Yellow pink? You know, you do the same with Terran, you know? It's like, maybe he thinks that SEVs constructors up from the ground, you know? They build like three depots, and then the barracks, they land on top of the depot. He thinks barracks are really broken because they form the main core of the Thor Such a powerful core, such a powerful core I think we got it I don't even want to say that he sucks He just doesn't understand anything Like, you're just really dumb And that's okay, because you can learn more This is the beauty about being dumb is that you can just gain more knowledge and you won't be dumb anymore You can't ever unsuck But yeah, I don't want to give this guy the sucks I'm sure he made a lot of mistakes He never scouted His micro was god awful I mean, let's think back of that immortal fight. He just blind counters his opponent's army, then still manages to lose to his opponent's army, even though he has the heart counter towards it He's never in position His harass never worked I think he sent out two rumbies None of them didn't any damage So micro macro vision unit comp was good but accidentally so still overall okay you suck poof but also you're very dumb. Poofoof triple stamps I'm gonna go back I've been using this pen to dig a hole out of this cave so I think by next week I might be able to escape out of this place and we'll be back into my my own little home studio ideally so hopefully till then guys see you all next week and bye-bye don't forget subscribe hit the like button what the hell."

Nah, it's not it either Oh, I remember Is imba Oh yeah, here we go Okay Let's get this baby out. Dear Harstam, I am your big fans from China In this game, I'm your big fans from China In this game, I truly believe that Toss is too imba at the early time in this game I found out that the Toss wants to have a three-base all in, with a lot of zealots I hold his attack and have a huge advantage I even had double supply than he had at the nine minutes in this game However, I lose this game just because the base trade I can't understand why Toss can use the warp gateways to send its armies in any place in the map You can't predict where they will come from This is too strong. If this is not Imba, please tell me how can do to defeat the Toss? Name, gold mine, race, Taryn, Leek, Diamond, server, China Oh yes, we got another Chinese replay, my dude It's absolutely beautiful. The moment you read the description you already know, like the Chinese have a way with words that for some reason the Westerners just do not they just they really hit the nail on the head when it comes to their balance descriptions absolutely beautiful on top left here we have a root wg but we're going to call him gold mine for now for blue terran player from china the man that sent in the replay and he was complaining mainly about not being able to realize what direction the opponent army comes from. Now that's very interesting of course because there are ways to get vision on the map you can use units to get vision you can build depots on the sides just like Tos builds pilots very often you can build like a depot over here for example for some vision against prisms you can have a unit out here like a marine and then a marine out here and I'm surprised that he complains about not knowing where his opponent come from because this map is Romantic side You have this ramp and you have this ramp There's two ways Okay, there's two main roads You just need to keep your eyes on both the roads. Maybe Goldmine prefers it if there's like just one massive tunnel, you know, the entire map is just one straight line and there's expansions on the side and the rest just airspace Maybe that would be better for him, but for now, I mean, you do have to deal with two entrances for your first three basis I'm sorry for that gold mine I guess we can't win them all in life So we're just going to pay attention semi closely to the build order I just want to see like, hey, is everything going properly here? It gets the orbital is a little bit late, gets his reaper. Because one of the things I often see in games in Diamond League and in Platinum League is these guys, they, okay, they're good enough, right? They now know that they can get away with some micro at some points in the game and very often they pick the wrong timings to micro and the wrong timings to macro so for example what's very common is you'll see these guys micro their reaper like their life depends on it while floating 600 minerals and very often later on in the game they won't be microing their army at all and they'll be doing things like setting up a new base or building some extra structures while the fight of a lifetime is happening you know these priorities are switched. It's like when the Titanic was going down and he had one of the repairmen going, maybe I should try and fix some of the light bulbs rather than, you know, maybe try to either get out alive or fix the freaking ship I don't think one repairman would have been able to fix the Titanic, but that's a story for a different time Perhaps with two, they would have been able to do it So here we have Reaper Man going in And as I mentioned, he obviously is forgetting his gas for about half a minute now. He has three SUV skewed up, which at least he's building workers, which is nice but yeah this gas is a little bit too late it's not brilliant he's gonna send the Reaper back home did he get the info no it goes in with the Reaper gets a complete free sprout but doesn't manage to see the tech it's like I wonder where the tech could be maybe here or here you see both pilots it really isn't rocket science guys come on just get it right okay just freaking get it right dude it's not that hard okay um yeah Reaper's just gonna Nice little mine Q4D8 charge, I believe they're called the Reaper grenades Beautiful. I love the names they gave to the attacks of the units and the so well thought I like the lore of StarCraft too I don't tend to like people that know too much about the lore, but the lore itself is pretty pretty tight Nice Good job, StarCraft You did a nice job there It's not doing a nice job It's not doing a nice job It's gold mine right now as he's floating 400 Minerals hasn't built any marines in a while I'm obsessive he can't seem a little bit low I think he might have missed one or two cycles already He's just floating 300 minerals His third depot is way too late. What's this guy doing? Why can't I zoom in on him? Alright mate Oh, you're just chilling in the corner? He's going to build a VC Hmm Interesting What? What was he gonna do there? Was he gonna swap the start with maybe it was a mistake? Probably was a mistake I have no clue why he would do that Okay, gets a tackle up here, gets a tackle up here Why is everything going so slow? Like what his first two minutes looked kinda tight and then afterwards this this meta-back is already supposed to hit That's 435 Now he sees a hallucination It's like, okay, this is scary Let me just return back home That's not how it works You just have to commit. Just keep going Ereloon, hallucination will go away Okay, CC is going to finish up at least It's not going to get a raven, so you should move this away Has he not been building workers properly? I haven't been paying attention to it, but I don't know too much about this matchup, but you're not supposed to be up 10 workers for free That's actually not how it's supposed to be Especially if you're playing blink because you're chrono boosting a lot in the blink, you're also chrono boosting in the Robo So there's like three, four chronobo total on Twilight and Robo most likely So you're not actually going to be up 10 workers at this point yet. That usually comes a little bit later into the game Hello? Can we get the Can you get the orbital going? Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey! I was gonna say okay there we go how many more haste can I do with I was afraid for a second he was never gonna morph it into an orbital use in the main base as well interesting let's just ignore that for now though okay so about a minute and 30 seconds after it's supposed to hit he finally hits and well that's life sometimes he's gonna kill ten works actually There's a nice micro He floats a little bit of money, but I don't mind that This was kind of worth it He's about equal in workers. He should be up by about seven workers at this point, I think, but he hasn't been building workers as consistently So, yeah, it's not great Now, we look at the vision situation here Look at this This is so beautiful This is just great One, two, two pylons Nice pylon on the edge here as well Observer in the middle You have this adapt was in the middle for any potential move-outs This guy really understands how vision works, you know? Like he's just, that's so nice It's actually beautifully done I do really like that Okay I think he tried to go in again, so I was afraid that I missed more action, but that seemed to be the case A little bit of stalker harassment. It's actually going to do a little bit of damage, which is nice I like that This is cool Tos is playing quite well, and his vision is very good, which is nice. The other guy doesn't really have any vision at all. He's not really looking at the same picture here. You know what I'm saying? These are two different ends of the spectrum. They really... Oh, he does manage to spot this though. So I guess this is the three base all-in he was talking about. Yeah, this is kind of like if you know if he ever went to the doctor, they have like this piece of paper on the wall. Okay, when you were a kid and the doctor, there's like letters on there and there's like letters on there different sizes. And if the Protoss would have to do one of those tests, like he'd go in and he'd like, he'd read the letters. You know, maybe he'd need to squint his eyes a little bit to see all of the rows and the doctor says you have nice eyesight my man. Goldmine would go into the same office and the doctor says alright can you read that first letter. Goldmine is just looking at the completely wrong wall like looking to the ceiling or something like that. Like this guy has absolutely no clue what vision is or what it's all about. I'm not saying he needs glasses but he needs to start paying attention to the freaking paper on the wall, okay? That's what needs to be happening It's gonna get in, that's nice It's actually, he's doing a good job with the control on these units I'll actually give him that He's a scathing a lot of worker kills He's a nice army as well He has absolutely no clue where he's gonna get hit from. He's just By pure luck Does he decide to actually move towards the middle But he was just standing here idling His opponent could have walked into his natural Like five times already He has no clue Now accidentally spots it With a matter fact as well It's actually ridiculous Actually ridiculous You can't fight this problem Hello protist man So I say you can't fight this It is because there's 1-1 and there's three minds and then armory has finished This is not the type of fight you usually want to take if you're a provost, okay? It's just not the type of fight you want to take Try to blink forward It's going to be a major yikes here. These mines are going to recharge and then, yeah, okay Now, this is probably the fight he was talking about The three-based other than completely fails He's up 12 workers Really all he needs to do at this point is not die It's getting three more barracks I much rather would have had him get a 4CC Yeah, that would have been better Should get into gas again He's lacking some gas for the 2-2 upgrades Yeah, if he just gets a 4th CC, he's actually in a pretty sick spot He lost all of his metaphics, which sucks So he's going to need at least 4 metaphics before moving out, or he won't be able to support an army that has this type of size. He sees the army moving here I think he saw it, right? Mine's have pretty decent vision range, even for a burrowed unit The opponent goes in, does the blink trick? Well, doesn't quite do the blink Attempt the blink trick In life, it's not always about the things you succeed in, but it's about the things that you attempt And that was an attempt You know, I'm not going to complain about that My guys, he's moving out with two Mettax I don't like that, especially because he sees the army here Didn't he say he accidentally ended up in a base trade? But you just see his army on the road. on the right side getting ready to attack with your minds like is this what he was complaining about he saw this what other options did the prolos have here honestly I don't quite understand okay so yeah oh yeah we're gonna go back this is ridiculous okay look at this my man what he sees first he sees the the trick okay here he sees the Okay He's not even halfway across the map He can just walk back His third is as far away for him as it is for the prolos right now He sees the pros in an aggressive position This has to be a conscious decision Otherwise, he would make a terrible boxer. Like a street fighter, you know? He's like, this is the first jab, the first jab that he gets It like, he stands there It's like, poof First jab Then my man, goldmine, turns around anticipating the next jab Instead, he just gets knocked out in the back of the head, completely not expecting it to come from there, because who could have known that if the person is right in front of you, that that's exactly where the hit is gonna come from? Brilliant That's absolutely brilliant This guy doesn't only need glasses, he also needs a brain I should call the guy, that made Frankenstein Help him out a little bit. Okay, so if you know, okay, if you know your opponent's army is here and you're committing to a base trade, perhaps this army should be here Up the ramp Mine's burrowed up there So worst case scenario, you hold your ramp and you kill all your opponent's units and probes while you're up in absolutely everything in life SEVs, army, upgrades Tech But instead, he stims in with three marauders and two marines and doesn't burrow the two mines Into an army of 20 stalkers, seven zealots in immortal and two sentries This guy did not finish elementary school either We and him are the same Like, he can't freaking count That's actually ridiculous. Okay, now he's like, hey, wait, maybe I should try to hold the ramp And maybe not use the army on the other side of the map He isn't stimming his army either What is this mine burrow in case he decides to blink up this ramp? What? Why would he do that? Like, why would he do that? that Okay, it's going to lose a lot here Five mines still Hey, his position still isn't too bad He can lift his building He's probably going to, uh, it's two orbitals He's going to keep one orbital alive, I guess, right? Seems pretty reasonable It loses these mines Army supply is equal I don't think plus two will finish. If plus two finishes though, that would be really, really sick If plus two doesn't finish, it's still good I mean, he's up in upgrades I don't want to get free demonstrate, yeah, good Up in upgrades, he has more production, he has two orbitals He's actually flying away with both These SEVs should die That's a mistake by the pretty big mistake by Tos Why is he not just killing both bases at once? Hello? Can we What? Hello, go back Is he splitting off part of his army? Why would you do that in a base trade? That's super risky Okay, Starport Factory. Like he probably could just save these, no? What's the armies like? 11 marauders, 5 mines, 12 marines and 2 medevacs, against 14 stalkers Yeah, you can just fight this army as well That's completely fine Not with half your army Okay, so they just lost 2 marauders and 5 mines for free Why would he do that? He's gonna lose this, it's gonna burn down I think he's still ahead I'm not sure if he still 100% wins a fight I think he might If it's in an okay position, he has plus two His opponent has no production except for a gateway and a robot that are unpowered You can drop mules, yeah I remember him having like 200 energy on here. They just go home and defend, no? Like mate, you're outmining your opponent three times You have better upgrades, so every unit you make is better than your opponent's unit Your opponent has no tech He's going to be stuck on gateway units and you're stuck on bio This is a win Like the other guy realizes and starts trying to attack No But he doesn't even, the TOS doesn't even think he can't attack, which I think the Toss might be right I think Dairn can still just, ah, the MataVX are too low, though That's an issue If the METAX weren't so low, I think TOS could have actually, or the Taryn could have just A-move Now I'm not sure if he can. I mean, it doesn't matter because he can just produce from here is outmining his opponent massively Literally all he needs to do at this point is relax Do nothing It's built a factory, maybe a second CC over here or something like that And then after like two more production rounds Have you actually been dropped one too many times on your head or something? Like what is this dude? You're outmining your opponent three times You have better units You have more production You're getting a factory What are you even drop? Like, what are you going to drop? The other guy isn't defending anything Like, it's just one base You're not going to multitask your opponent here. there's one spot either his army will be there or it won't be if his army is there that means you can kill his bay you can you will just lose your drops if his army isn't there it probably means he's in front of your base and he's going to kill your remaining army here no matter where his army is unless it's in the bottom right this is the worst call you could have made like there is no world in which this was the correct call unless he was a if like unless there's 15 stalkers attacking this depot then you can do the drop and then you hope that this is all there's left at home but even then there's a recall so I'm still not a fan of it like there's actually no scenario here in which this is the correct play you just build four freaking depots at the same time then you do two more production rounds and you just straight up win the game this is awful terrible and I hate you for this. Gigi It's unbelievable Okay, let me open this stupid, the complaint form You truly believe that toss is to him I don't really care what you believe I've seen you play You held this attack You had a huge advantage I don't even think huge quite covers the advantage that you had Your advantage was just humongous It was so big Like, you lose this game just because of the base rate, which you initiated You initiated the base trade That wasn't him You made that decision Or, well, maybe for you it wasn't a decision, but that should have been a conscious decision You can't understand why Toskin used to warpgate, waste, and its army in any place in the map. What do you mean? He came from the direction you saw he came from Like, if you can't predict where this will come from, you're going to have such a rough time, in life Like, how do you cross the road? It's like you just, you have these things that horses have, you know? You just look straight It's like, I can't predict if there will be any cars coming from the left or the right How do I cross this road? It's like, dude, just take of these things I don't know what they're calling English The horses have them as to not scare them Perhaps we should give you some as all You want the map to be a tunnel already All right back to business. Yeah, you suck Yeah, it is honestly, yeah, nothing else to say Your micro was actually not bad Your micro is pretty good Your first two minutes were not bad Your macro, not great Your map vision, hard suck It's a double suck on the vision And your decision making was also a hard suck. which altogether your average is big sucking congratulations pang pang pang give him three stamps hamster I love when you do things like that all right I think that's it now yeah it's gonna be today's episode of is it imba or do I suck if you did enjoy this episode of is it inba or do I suck we have many more episodes in the recommendation bar and also underneath and other places thanks for watching don't forget the like button subscribe to the channel I'll see you all next time for a new video Bye-bye."

        "text": "What's up guys? This is day one of my escape and I spoke to an Amazon driver who delivered me the phone in the cave and he said that there's an old YouTuber called Husky Starcraft around that I'm looking for so I'll keep you guys up to date of what's happening and I'll hopefully be able to walk back home soon See you guys Boy is day two I managed to find the husky. He was living out in the woods close by my cave and we had a relatively nice relationship for the time we're together he said I reminded him of an old love and he was talking about wings or freedom or something like that and then about like seven hours in as I thought things were going really well he just completely build on me for whatever reason so I'm gonna continue my journey on alone this was day three I hope to tell you guys more once I hit some intelligent life see you soon I'm not sure if you can see it but Loco just passed by and look what I found here It's a little bit of zircling poop. I tasted it and I'm 90% sure this is zircling poop So yeah, with the zircling poop and spotting loco, I feel like intelligent life is further away than I thought it initially was All right, guys, I set up this trap yesterday Let's see if we caught anything Oh! Let's see what's inside Let's look like some fries, maybe some curry No ketchup but I think we're gonna have to do with it We're getting very close to home You made it home guys You made it home You made it home It's good to be back, boys Let's get into it An email An email In balance complaint form harsdom I believe that Protos is OP. I open with a 12-pool, which kills my opponent's gateway, but is otherwise defended I begin messing roaches after scouting his twilight counsel and easily defend the zealid attack Eventually I max out and attack with a Roach Hydra army and watch it evaporate as it gets stormed over and over again I tried to build Brood Lords to counter his powerful ground army, but it was too little Too late And I lose two bases to his attack I tried to continue on from that point, hoping the Brutelords could save me, but it was futile So I ask you, is Storm Inba? Are Brutelords ever a good idea? Do I just suck? Thank you for your inside. name meme lord race zirk league diamond m m m m rick 300 and last but not least the server from america so this is uh honestly kind of promising to be a banger already so let's up straight into it put on the headphones as well who nice everything kind of feels like old what do we have here mr meme lord so we have a zirk player who says he is a diamond player that does a 12 pool and then manages to take out the gateway Look at this Proulos player is actually trying to block the hatchery of his opponent I like that This is a really cool move That's cool to see that This happens in diamond as well. It's even taking the minerals and then builds the gateway This is the optimal probe movement This is very nice to see Wow I like Bonzo This guy is really cool What the heck? Look at that opener This looks so tight I'm so proud of you, Bonzo I actually do think that's pretty cool I didn't know people in Diamond were doing openers like this, you know, where they send out the probe in time Like, honestly, this looks like my own game so far This is beautiful Bonzo Oh, wait, sorry We're looking at the 12 pool The only thing that sucks for Bonzo is that he's so busy blocking No, he's actually going to scout This is actually so well done This is beautiful. Okay? This is actually beautiful What is he doing? He's going to, I was pretending to take a hatchery Poor Bonzo is getting completely completely tricked by his opponent Built to Pylon and then he's gonna try to block this base Does Bonzo know right now that there's a 12 woman? Bonzo has the instincts of a freaking hyena if those have good instincts Otherwise he has the instinct of I don't know what animals have good instincts Like a lion maybe? I feel like humans have pretty good He has the instinct of a superior human Holy crap, this is brilliant Bonzo is a genius What the heck? He's blocking this with a gateway as well He's saying no way you're getting this base, buddy. There's no shot I kind of like this Okay, he's forcing his opponent to take this base But finishing the pilot and getting a gateway there I don't like that in that case you're playing two gateways Not necessarily Also, a cyber course way too late Should be finished at this point, but, you know, it is what it is That's beautiful, Bonzo I love that. good thumbs up for bonzo um what are we seeing from meme lord mean or supply block why is he supply block why is he arriving so late if he also isn't taking his natural i feel like meme lord here took the worst of both worlds you know you ever have like like your friends have these dilemmas whereas like um like either like you you lose your legs and get a a million dollars or um you'll need to work 80 hours a week for the rest of your life But you'll be able to sprint at superhuman speed, you know My man, Mimlord, in this situation, would go like, I'd like to work the 80 hours a week, and I'd like to lose my legs. These friends go like, what the heck's wrong with you, Mimlord? It's this type of guy, you know? He takes the worst of both worlds Not only does he hit too late with the links because he was busy trying to take down the pile and the gateway, but then he also doesn't even take the natural Now, the reason why, let me just pass this, okay? A little bit of analysis here on this beautiful IOTUS episode The reason why that's not good is because when you're playing against adept and you open with 12 pool, your gas is very late. You see that? This is normal, the gas to be late, which means that two Adepts can just really stand in between this thing and then shade into the main, shade into the natural And they can force out a crap ton of Lings because Lings of creep cannot fight properly against Adepts So that is the reason why when you're 12 pooling, you never not want to take your natural base. as your natural base quick tip there for you mean Lord also if I were you I'd go for the I'd go for the hundred thousand dollars and the nolex I think it's the best out of all the options I'm are seeing here this queen hasn't injected or crept yet he lost all of his links I love that his zealous just chilling I just held on hold position it Why are you doing this Bonzo? No! It's an honorable salad, wants the fight to be fair, waited until the links and the queens came out See, that's how Protos' role, you know Protos players have a good sense of honor They're feeling good about themselves This guy, no honor. He had to wait for his mates to show up Now, he said he scouted at Twilight and then went for a roach warren and then defended perfectly Nice supply block, by the way. this is uh what was that yes for people who miss this okay um this is what we call first of all this is the goody supply block okay and the goody supply block gets fixed by building by finishing a main structure so right now we see this building still has 14 more seconds to go and he's like you know what there's no use building overlords because he knows the timing that overlords take longer than 14 seconds to build let me just wait for this hatchery to finish okay so you're going to wait for the to finish for supply to become available, but then as the hatchery finish, he does something that no one has thought of before, and that is to then produce the overlords. Because who would want to build units straight away, right? I love that I just, I think that's such a brilliant move here by Mimlord That's just great Once again, taking the worst of both worlds He's actually just the king of this I wonder what, like, a jet, like, what type of decisions he makes in his. his general life then you know if he's so bad at picking what's right and what's wrong for him he's the guy that goes into the shop check what was on discount last week and then buys it he's like wouldn't want to be paying any less and when some people consider eating healthy this man just looks at the back to see which product has the most sodium in it and then takes that this is meme lord nine drones wow another overlord yeah we only have 16 supply open Pretty smart Very smart even Okay, so he scouted the Twilight now He's like, okay, Twilight, this means I need a road to warn and an Evo chamber Okay? It kind of makes some sense. Well, the Evo chamber not as much, but I like the road warren Roadwarren is good here I don't understand why he has so little workers I feel like, well, probably because he was supply blocked and then built eight overlords at once, but Yeah, it's not looking super brilliant Did I slow down the game to watch? No, this seems fine I don't know It's been a long time, guys Okay Life outside wasn't as great as live in front of the PC I can tell you that much This is great, by the way Like, the creep is almost scouting it I think goes to the left side I love it Because he really wants to take this as a fourth, I guess. If he takes this as a fourth, I'll just end the game We'll do another episode next week, but that will be Like, we'll just put the stamp on hamster We'll call it a day, you know? We'll do the pop And then we'll be yet Okay, he sees the lack of a third base Now all the alarm bells in his head should be ringing He already has eight roaches He's fine Yeah, this is good He could probably keep mining, but yeah, I don't even mind this Yeah, sure Go mine from your naturals, taking the gases there Builds a couple more roaches, but he knows it doesn't need too much So, yeah Now, this is a very nice defense here, meme lord. I'm completely fine with this I'm a-okay with how you defended this, honestly That was pretty tight Good stuff, man Good stuff He also knows where these roaches or where these zealots are coming from I was wondering if he figured it out But yeah, he definitely did figure out Built seven more drones He stops an attack and his reaction, okay So there's two reactions at this point, okay? So you can either go for a full-on roach counter attack and you're like, okay, I'm so far ahead, I just want to kill him And you just keep building units, roaches, and then eventually you just reinforce with links The other option is that you just drone up to the highest amount of drones that you can. and then you start building workers Okay? So that's kind of, that's the ultimate eco or the ultimate attack But here we see five drones into five overlords And usually when What is this guy defending? It's very keen of this extractor, I guess I've never seen this I was going to say maybe if there's liberal rate the harassed but then I realized we're watching a PVZ None here Honestly, technically there's no sports in any of the mineral lines So if people would show you pictures of each base and ask you what's different, you wouldn't be able to tell. And it's like one of those questions you get on like your exam and then no one really agrees on the answer there, you know? You have to go to the exam commission or whatever and get it all fixed Rough I know the life, even though I haven't been in school for more than 10 years at this point But it doesn't show many people tell me, hey, okay, very, very intelligent The things you say on the daily basis That's fine It's because I self-study a lot On the battle net forums I have a very big vocabulary I know more insults in English, then trilingual speakers will know in all of their languages combined. And that's really a product of me visiting the battle net forums every day You know how sometimes you have like these motivational videos of people just grinding You know, it's like, when you wake up, you get ready for the grind It's like I always, I feel the same when I wake up at like 6 a m and do like my two hour research on the battle net forums, you know, improve my language skills and just my vocabulary read my diction and how to write essays basically I feel like that always, yeah, it's a good start of the day and it's hard work, you know, it isn't easy, but I do get it done I love that, yeah, I mean, there's no spore. He's going to get everything targeted down He also didn't go for the economic option, by the way He went for the middle of the road again He decided, you know what, I don't want to kill my opponent, but I also don't want to get a lot of money Instead, I want my opponent to stay alive and I want to be poor Once again, a very good decision here coming out of Meemlord It's one of those decisions that I really do appreciate Plus to range on the way That's good That's actually good I mean, he's fighting against the guy I think he has two forges or something Oh, yeah, I saw two forges there So, on that production time. So, yeah, what he could do here is he could scout his opponent, figure out, hey, what's my opponent doing? He sees two immortal or two robots pumping immortals, okay? two robots pumping immortals Now, maybe Memlord is not aware, but there's a thing like armor type And if you have a unit that is armored, like the roach, they will take extra damage from a unit that does more damage against armored units, like, you guessed it, the immortal So it would be wise to pick a different type of unit to fight an army that looks like this If you have an army that consists of almost exclusively immortals, things like lynx are really, really good. A, links don't take bonus damage and B, Immortals shoot really slow, but they do a lot of damage per shot, but they're still not one-shoting links So links are absolutely perfect as long as the Arcon count isn't too high Now, things like hydras do fine as well Lurkers are actually very good The hydras, they don't scale too well because once storm is out, it's not great, but Hydra Lurker or Roach Hydra Lurker would definitely deal okay with this army. or now this is a controversial topic in the zirk community in diamond but if you see your opponent building exclusively units that attack ground it could be an option to throw down a spire and get a couple of muras no base defense no base defense well unless you count these four immortals that can shoot air however because meme lord isn't scouting what he's doing instead is he's doing a classic move I think I've spoken about this one before as well This is testing if the meat grinder works by inserting your head And he's about to find out that this meat grinder works very well There's eight immortals, there's two Archons, and he has units that take. Well, the Revedgers actually aren't even that bad against immortals, but all the roaches does absolutely disappear Like, they got blasted by these immortals, and he's going to lose this fight Like, not many Zirks have lost fights before It's relatively impressive, honestly I'm just Holy crap that's big Gets completely blasted out of this world Here's a response after seeing 10 immortals is to build five more roaches Every single roach he builds, I think is minus 10 IQ points at this point At this point and so far what Mean Lord has been showing me is, well, I'm wondering if he's making the triple digits before the roach deduction We've already seen five roaches What I say 10 points minus? We're at 50 right now. Max, down to 10 Yikes Are we going to see negative IQ this game? It's kind of a spire though I kind of like that Investation pit as well So it's possible the spires just for the greater spire I do recall him mentioning Brutlords, I think Or was it Vipers in his little essay? I think it was Brutlords So maybe we'll see some Brutlords there But for now he's just happy not doing much of anything He's outmining his opponent by a crepton He still isn't aware of this left side base, by the way And I do like that as well. well he's like yeah this is this was a normal army that this guy got off of two days that seems completely okay actually the army wasn't all that big it's just that it really just oh seven more roaches minus 60 oh geez soon the place where his brain is supposed to be is just going to be a black hole because it's like negative energy this is actually painful to watch hive going down like there is a help that I think it's F12 here Serg units let me show this to you okay weak against the immortal the immortal is strong against the roach they help you like these are things that you don't need like like I you don't you don't need me to tell you these things okay you can figure these out yourself just F12 okay HOTK is F12 meme lord after i'll make a video just for you okay i'll send you a little document like a seven-step instruction first maybe how to plug in the keyboard at times i'm not even sure if that's being done here okay you're getting plus one carapace i don't quite know why but i mean to be fair my man meme lord has absolutely zero info so i guess there could be five stargates pumping phoes and then you want to get corruptors with carapace upgrades maybe realizes their storm and eight immortals maybe it's time to run you don't have to fight it's it's not compulsory it's not an obligation that you need to keep it's you can run roaches. That hell's the brain disappearing You ever did this trick where you knocked on someone else's head and then like knock the table like pretending like it's empty? I feel like meme lord doesn't need the table Like this really is something else He's getting the grapes ready Did he wait for his carapace to finish? No, he was like, you know what? The carapace, maybe not quite as good good or as useful as I thought Are the broodlord just going to be too late? I think a broodlord is just going to be too late This is going to be very painful Okay, there is a trick Now, this trick is pretty crazy. But when you see your opponent's army on the map, imagine your meme lord, okay? And you see this army And he probably doesn't start counting I don't know, people that can't count, do they still realize that this is many immortals? Like, this is a bigger amount of immortals than a small amount of immortals, Mium Lord So this is an amount of immortals where your units can't fight Okay? So what you can do rather than getting the fight here is you try for a base trade You're getting units that your opponent can't fight So eventually you will stabilize in the base trade And maybe you can take out a couple of bases or force him to run back That's a good analysis to make. Another thing that you can do is to make sure that the concrete is hard by jumping into it head first Hard knock because there's no brain inside, but not quite sure how brilliant it is Yeah, I mean, this fight is completely blasted Holy crap That was a nice upgrade It's a 2-2 on shields I don't know why, but I'm a big fan of that Now the Great Spires about the finish I love the spines against the seven immortals That's definitely going to win a lot of time It's like two shodding hatcheries almost Two broodlords I love this Oh my god, this is some great resource management as well He sees this army, it's like, okay, nothing can shoot up with range. Should I build broodlords out of every single corrupter or would it be better to get 21 hydras and only two broodlords and then five or three more after I finished the first two? Of course our friend went for the Hydra option Imagine if there actually was, how many could he have gotten? Two, four, plus three Nine He could have gotten nine Brutlords Nine Brutlords against three Arcons He would have blasted this fight He would have owned it so hard Like even now, like it's still almost working, but just not quite And that's frustrating That's frustrating, you know? I look at this and I go, there was potential here There really was potential potential here I know you knew it as well. You look back at the replay and you go, ah, if only, you know, but I mean, the hydras worked so well for you the other fight I mean, that fight in the middle, where you had like 20 hydras, I think you almost killed an Archon So, that's like the type of trade that you're really looking forward to I completely understand it Like, the precedent that the hydras had set before in fights was so good that for you in your mind, it almost seemed silly not to build them again. Yeah, I mean that's just how it is sometimes that is how it be sometimes You're still not in a you're still not completely dead by the way if you just look at this It's kind of playable isn't it to void race I mean you could now getting hydras wouldn't even be too bad There's a lot of arcons though I think there might be too many arcons Yeah, could maybe do a run by here if you knew that that base existed I guess there's cannons so even that's not possible yeah Yeah, it's gonna be hard to stabilize at this point, honestly You can get a bunch of over there, I guess You could do that Some long-distance mining Don't mind it at all. I think that's even pretty good Um I do kinda like it indeed Um Actually, maybe with a brutal, nah, no shot It's a good avoid, right? The problem is just that you had no information whatsoever, Mimlord Like, if you knew you may There's too many batteries You never would have been able to kill him You had to rebuild drones, I think, and just go for the longer macro game Honestly, you mentioned I think you said Storm was O P , no? How is Storm O P? in this game? He hit, like, two storms And one of those was just now on the Brutelords, after you're down 60 supply Like I don't know, this honestly this game is kind of cringe No cap. Gigi! All right, no, at least you jujit, you know? Let me read this Where you had, Mr Post? How do I get there? Stuck in a K for a couple of weeks, and you really don't know anymore how PCs work Where are we at? I believe that ProD is OP, he opened with a 12 pool Right, didn't get his natural, didn't run across the map easily, or quickly Pretty poor start for him He did defend everything He got up like 90 supply That was good I agree with that And then just kept building roaches into an army consisting of only immortals and only High Templar. He then added on a couple of hydras so that the storm was a couple, a little bit more useful Then eventually he decided to remix on 21 hydras rather than making instantly nine broodlords Was your micro good? No Your micro sucked Was your macro good? No, you got support Oh, I forgot about the supply blocks the creative way you managed to get out of them So your micro sucked, your macro sucked, your unit comp sucked, your unit movement sucked I mean, this is just not even on average, just everything Like the best thing you did still was awful My friend, you just making sure you suck That's a fact.

        "text": "Dear Captain, I'm gonna complain about Mac Terran I met a Mac Terran on the ladder He played Hellbeth, plus Tank, plus Tor With his first and second push, I defended with Immortals, basically flank with Immortals plus Zellat It actually worked well With that advantage, I transit into Airtles for late game, as I suspect he might go for Liberators Or battle cruisers Terrans normally would do that But he kept on Thor production, and Tours are so good against Carriers and Tempest so I end up losing it People are saying that zealots are good against MacTaron I doubt it, as zealots are so vulnerable against Hellbat or Tank. If my opponent have mines, I don't know why he decided not to go for them, it could be even worse Is Immortal the best choice for late-game PVT Mac? But using Immortal sometimes ends up in fighting tank range, which is not a good trade in his second push Is Airtos just a worse choice in this scenario, or simply my micro sucks? Late-game protels would need tempest or equivalent, equal villain to snipe tanks, right? P S I said, you may Gigi, mocking my opponents at around 11 minutes after his first push has failed But actually, I'm the clown Yours, Tico So he already is admitting to being a clown, and he said that he bad-mannered his opponent while losing. I mean, yeah, you love to see it Let's just hop straight into this replay, I guess What do we have here? We have Tico C H This is a game, by the way, played on Diamond I think Diamond 1 on the Chinese server, so another Chinese replay And you know that the Chinese replays never seem to ever disappoint For whatever reason, the Chinese replays are just simply superior And I'm really looking forward to this He said he's struggling with Mac And, okay, he did something This is, let me, let me just pause it right here Let me just go back at it He did something, which I always love to do as well. What he did here was, if my opponent have minds, I don't know why he decided not to go for them, it could be even worse This is the type of stuff you do when you're arguing balance with one of your friends I have this often when I'm talking to Xerks And I'm like, hey, how do I beat the queen walk? And they'll be like, well, you open this route I'm like, okay, but if I open this ruptor, how do I beat muta? Well, like, well, then you scout and you get Phoenix I'm like, okay, but what if I get Phoenixes? And then they just play Reveger Ling Baines Like, well, then you get this. Not realizing in that case that all you really need to do a lot of the time is to scout Like, you can react to things if you scout Just because someone doesn't do something doesn't mean he's an idiot, it means he picked a different strategy So it's a little side note there already for you, Tico Just because you don't understand why he didn't go minds, doesn't mean it's necessarily bad In general, actually, mines tend to be quite bad in Mac compositions because they can't really attack into an opponent They have very short range, things like Disruptors completely destroy them, and even things like good zealot flanks are just kind of good against them. So, yeah, I would not really suggest mines a lot of the time as disruptor really is just a very big hard counter Now, why is this guy opening with the CC on the high ground? I'll explain why this is not optimal I usually don't like giving too much feedback on the player who didn't send it in, but if you build a CC on the low ground, after you play Barracks, no gas, your CC will always finish before anything can hit it, because you didn't get a gas. I think this build in general isn't great, but if you're going to play this build, it's probably best to play it on the low ground or to put it in a space where your opponent can't see it So in that case, you're kind of pretending to be one basing I don't even mind that too much You just go a fast, full depot, well, maybe that was the plan You know what? I kind of like this I'm fine with this I take back everything I said about my man Ziac He's an all right dude Okay? You have a proxy gateway Oh, he's playing the departing three gate build order Which is, I actually made a guide on this a while ago. And this is a good build order Let's see how he actually does it If he does it correct I can't quite remember the exact I think this looks pretty okay though He's getting his gateway in time He's getting Chrono Boost ready He's staying on one gas Second Chrono Boost at the appropriate time as well He didn't scout, which I actually think is perfect when you're playing this build because you need all the money that you can get Now it is important that you're almost continuously building workers He got a couple of workers there He still is cutting Hello, you have it selected There we go Taking your time Yeah, this actually looks relatively good Good opener I like this. This is nice to see He's actually playing a build order First warpin should finish, I believe, at 318 I'm not sure if he's going to be able to make it I don't think he's going to be able to make it, but even if he's a little bit later, that should be absolutely fine You get five adepts on the other side of the map at around 325 in their natural, 3 30 latest in their natural We see that he's a little bit delayed, but he actually did a very good job executing this build order I mean for Diamond 1, 4 seconds late in a build order, that's absolutely fantastic Okay, well, you forgot one at that Okay, maybe he's 10 seconds, 12 seconds late. Okay, that's a little bit less good Especially because we're only three minutes into the game Oh, this guy's falling already? Whatever I mean, yeah, it's not great But, I mean, it could be worse He also has been cutting workers for the past five minutes It feels like he's actually downing workers I didn't even know that was possible against Territ but our man Tico is actually managing to do it I mean, he has as many adepts as his opponent has marines How is he losing this fight? Maybe we would stop stutter-stepping for half a second He would have already won this with way less lost. How did he lose this many units? He should have absolutely destroyed this with like four adepts remaining, I think Now he's getting stalkers, but the tank is out, yeah It's the end of the party I mean, he continued work Honestly, it's not a terrible start I feel like he should have had more workers And if he had microd better, he probably would have been able to straight up kill his opponent Or if he warped in the three stalkers a little bit quicker as well So it's like literally four or five things that he could have done that would have just straight up one in the game, either probing up far enough, microwing his adepts or getting the stalkers about 10, 15 seconds faster. These three things all would have put him in a position where he's super far Right now he's just regular head He's not super far ahead, just regular head He doesn't quite know if his opponent has a star port He does know his opponent as a factory and has an eBay in the wall But he doesn't know much else yet. So very often with little information it can be quite tricky and You know so far I actually think that Tico has been playing a little bit better than his opponent His opponent did a build order that didn't make a lot of sense had a lot of oversupply which meant that he had very little units very often if you're in investing too much in infrastructure or in things like supply depots, you end up with way too little units, which is kind of what happened here for Zach, Zayak, excuse me Or maybe this is, he writes everything in capital letters, except the L So his name is actually Zlag Zlek Possible Would be a good one to trick casters You sign up for a tournament. Everyone pronounce your name as Zayak They complain to the organization that is pronounced slack Because it's actually a non-capital L You get all the casters fired Then you sign up under a different different nickname as a community caster And with all the casters fired You now made a career in casting That's how easy it is to get something done in e-sports guys A lot of people ask me like hey how do I get to working in e-sports And my men's slack here Honestly had a pretty pretty decent idea I like it and he almost caught me as well because if he would have sent an email and it's like, hey, my name is pronounced Slack Give me your YouTube channel. I would have been like, well, that's a fair deal I did mispronounce your name accidentally So, yeah, I kind of like the plan there So if you too want to work in Esports, that might be a good tip for you Smart Of course, the Esportscasters are also watching this They'll be on top of it Maybe it's a meta game a little bit So it actually is a capital I And they're pronouncing your name as Slack. and there's a no no it's Zyak and you got him I don't know why people watch these videos you're getting three cannons you love to see it so you scout the fact that your opponent has four command centers and two production facilities a total of like four units and your brilliant idea is to get three cannons on the far left side what does this even defend like I always okay whenever I look at this type of thing I always try to think what is the most positive interpretation of this move okay so imagine our man's leg decides to move across the map and is very keen on attacking this specific location I'm not even saying in general the third base but up this specific ramp which would be very weird with Mac because I think the natural pattern would be more towards middle. But if he decides to go up this ramp and then forgets to move back his units when he sees three cannons, these three cannons are going to be a golden investment I can tell you that much However, if Slack decides to go up here or, God forbid it, goes into the natural, Tico actually has nothing This is a 450 mineral investment that's doing nothing for him right now Those could have been gateways This could have been an extra nexus I mean, he's seen freaking four command centers, four orbitals at this point already and his response is to build three cannons at a location that only defends this very specific ramp that never sees an attack Impressive decision-making. Daily reminder that he only has six units so far You know you're usually in a bad spot if your opponent has more tanks and Thor's than you have gateway units, especially if you have no other units whatsoever Zlag could just move across the map at this point, aim move, pull the SCVs, then dance, drop mules, fly one of the orbiters, fly one of the orbiters, to the other side of the map, drop mules with that orbital, land it What's the up motion? Lift it, then land it again, and still be absolutely fine Slack is absolutely light years ahead here, Tico You're doing nothing correct How is it possible that he's constantly behind in workers? He just doesn't build workers Look at this. He just doesn't build workers, getting a fourth base now. now it's like man so difficult to afford fourth basis because he built three cannons here earlier because he hasn't been making any workers he's just down 30 supply well he's the only one that did damage so far so the game basically with the parting build what you want is i what i would want is to deny a little bit of mining and kill two three workers that's it my man killed seven workers okay he killed seven workers this is like okay so when i buy a when i buy a lottery ticket which is very rare let me state that in lotteries are scams if you're addicted to lottery ticket buying now's a good time to quit what's I gonna say if I buy a lottery ticket okay the best case scenario or a scenario I'm happy with is when I retrieve the money back that I invested into my lottery ticket okay so I go in pay a lottery ticket or scratch whatever they got five euros nice same amount of money as I'm happy with that I didn't expect that much I was hoping for that. I didn't expect this much However, my man Tico went in, got the scratch-off ticket, got $5,000 and I was like, hey, that's brilliant Let me just keep buying more and more lottery tickets until I lose all of my money And that's exactly what Tico so far has been doing in this game He just keeps buying more and more lottery scratch-off tickets I'm sure if those are called lottery tickets, until he lost all of his money and boom, there he is Down 30 supply, equal amount of workers For whatever reason, he's getting armor first I'm not sure why. So usually you want to get armor against units with a high rate of fire because then the armor works multiple times, right? Imagine you have one unit who does 50 damage every second, then one armor will make it 49 damage every one second Now imagine you have a unit that shows 20 times per second and does five damage, then the one armor works 20 times there So it's minus 20 damage per second for that one unit If you're playing against Mac you mainly want to be investing into attack upgrades Armor upgrades simply aren't that useful against tanks and tors We have very high impact but slow rate of fire Yeah, my man's luck, nothing has happened this game by the way. Tico is completely unaware of what is happening as well He's getting four stargates So he scouted four factories and his response is to go up to five immortals, six stalkers, five zealads, then throw down four stargates, which gets scanned And then I guess start building tempest from there You love to see it Also has 1200 gas in the bank, by the way, which zealots are good against, uh, against Mac, but what's even better is zealot-Arcon immortal. If you attack a hellbat tank Thor Terran with a flank with Zelet Arcon immortal, equal supply, and you actually flank so you don't just walk through a choke, there's no way in hell you're going to lose, unless maybe you're down 20 supply, but that's a different story Here we see my man Tico, aim moving into an unseached terrain, and yeah, he's just going to absolutely blast this This was a nice fight for him, by the way Should have probably used Guardian Shield, but it's not the biggest deal Like I said, plus two armor is nice, but doesn't matter too much against tanks and Thor's So he kills absolutely everything He loses almost nothing. And all of a sudden, out of nowhere, he's in a fantastic position this is one of the reasons why we don't really see Mac players attack usually is because if they're not siege completely they lose if he actually did G G G G G I think and I guess this means get out or something or Gigi this is my game that's something that's what he said right this is actually great this is actually great but our man's slack you know he's he's he's a he's a rougher things you know he had a worse time in life before you know he's he knows the bottom of the pit and he knows this isn't even close to the bottom of the pit he sieges up and he continues he knows his opponent is investing in stargates and he's like okay let me just throw a couple more tors couple more tanks tico is attacking into this position from one direction without any real meat in front of his army he has 2,400 gas a quick calculation That's a great recall. You could have just walked back like, mate, the tanks aren't going to chase you It's like calling in like a helicopter evacuation because a slot is chasing you Like, mate, you can just walk away There's no issue here So with the 2400 gas, he could have built eight arcons, which he didn't do He probably could have just destroyed this with like eight arcons, ten extra zealads What do we find? You should probably start thinking about a fifth base He has pretty decent eco at this point, but he's going to start mining out these extra patches as well And that's usually a bad thing Ah, there's a lot of Oh my god, he has 5K income Holy crap! 5 4K, 5 7. Oh boy, that's a lot of money Yeah, yeah, that's the mules right there the mules right there coming at you units lost still in favor of tico and tico decides here to do something really cool he decides to go into into carriers why is he getting plus armor upgrades on carriers yeah whatever now the thing with carriers is is that they're really really good against mac but you need something to deal with the thor's now there is a unit that deals really well with thor's and also with mines if they go for mines against this which sometimes they play mine thor or And that's the disruptor The disruptor is an absolutely brilliant unit against Thor's, because Thor's are very difficult to split. You can't really run away from the disruptor balls, and you can't really chase either So what you can do is you just throw some disruptor balls at the Thor's, then you run away And the Thor's are like trying to chase you, but they're obviously very slow And then if they chase you far enough, you have your next disruptor balls again And then eventually you hit like five or six, and boom, all the Thor's explode semi-simultaneously because you can have like two, three tours per ball And then you can say, well, what if he has a lot of tanks? Then I can't walk in with the disruptors. Well, if he has too many tanks, your carrier should just be able to win you the game So carrier disruptor, Tempest is a really good composition against Terran Mac People don't realize this, but that's such a sick composition in late game against Mac And it's very tricky to lose with as a Protos player Like, it's not easy Here comes the second push, though. It's getting Tempest? are good against air but they're not great against ground they don't actually do a lot of damage against ground carriers are just simply better he could have also gone for like carrier chariotrarchal of arkon immortal probably been fine these carriers are going to put in some work now yeah figure that yeah can even micro away a little bit it's beautiful using these immortals yeah would you look at that yeah carriers are good man what the heck So we could micro them back a bit, but this was a very, a very nice starter Now, just five Arcons would be so helpful because Arcon's tank so much They're so useful Oh! He's doing a beating Grandmaster with stupid stuff Look at that. He only is allowed to use either the ground part of his army or the air part of his army, but never at the same time Oh, that's really cool I didn't know that also was a thing on the Chinese server Huh, what do you know? The influence I have is There's no boundary Regular regular boundaries of countries Borders, they don't matter This nasty engagement Oh, that's well actually Never mind Completely fine engagement Destroyes all the Thor's, and then yeah, there's only tanks left, so you can actually just kind of own them Right now there's seven Thor's still And like you said, disruptors, Archon Immortal, all of these things are really fine Immortal in general is really good against Thor. But because you need some tanking, I always recommend getting a couple of zealots, a couple of arcons as well, in case there's tanks in the back But Disruptors are It's just built 11 DTs? Where did he build? Why can't I click on the DTs? Oh, they have blink as well I kinda like this This is just a good play overall against Aaron It's blinking on top of planetaries It's so powerful If you have 9 DTs with plus 3, you can 3-shoulder planetary If you have 11, you also can 3-shoulder planetary It's kind of how it works If you have 10, you can also 3-shoulder planetary Some people say that if you have 12, you can do the same. Now I'm starting to do the math in my head, how many you need to 2-shot, but I can't quite get to it So, I guess 14 would do the trick 14 probably would do the trick I think so, yeah Maybe 13 already, I don't know It is a possibility She has a lot of DTs He sniped the base Kill the planetary Now he loses a bunch of DTs He keeps kind of blinking around He built 11 Tempest to counter I'm not sure what he thinks he's countering with the tempest I think the tempest is probably the worst unit that Prolost can build against the Thor Let me pause and think about it. If we were to make a tier list here, what would be the best units? So we have Immortals, Disruptors I guess it would be S tier Is that the highest? Then you got like A tier that would be like Immortals, Celets and Archon, they already mentioned immortals? Okay, Immortals is S-tier with disruptor A-tier would be Zellet and Arcon B-tier would be the stalker Maybe the Voidre is worse against Thor's I think Voidreys might be better as well I think the Tempest is about equal with observers and prisms About as close Yeah, I think about as useful as observers and prisms A similar level Maybe mothership is worse I don't think mothership would even be able to do any damage. Just going in with these ds They just lost 11 DTs for nothing That's kind of big He's not even maxed at this point Sands in some zealots into the Helions Loving the flanking here Then moves forwards with the tempest And gets his head completely kicked him Holy crap this isn't closed Holy crap he got owned This wasn't close at all Big surprise That the slow unit, that's mainly an anti-air fighter because of the big range, usually good with static defense, doesn't fight well Oh, slack! Slack with a question mark I'm not sure if these are manner muse, but I hope they're manner muse Oh man I'm a big slack fan here The slack flank club It is, look this, four Thor's. I love that this guy never test anything out and he just thought that Tempus might be the answer Rather than just thinking about things, like, ah, Tempus, good anti-airfighter, long range pretty slow Thor, good anti-air fighter, especially single target I wonder who wins Gigi by Tico He honestly props to him for still typing Gigi and leaving the game I find that kind of admirable, honestly In a way, I really do find that admirable After getting so destroyed not only physically in the game, but also mentally by getting manner-mute after he did an offensive Gigi, I think we should just have a quick rundown of what happened here exactly Tico, Tico, Tico First of all, let me just grab your. your imbalance complaint for him again You complained about Mactaran You complained about I don't actually you complained about anything He complained about a hypothetical scenario I transit into Airtles for the late game as I suspect he might go for liberators or battle cruisers But he kept on Thor production He's complaining that his opponent didn't do what Terrans usually do That's his complaint He isn't actually complaining about imbalance He's complaining that this specific Terran didn't just play proper Starcraft Well, Tico, I can tell you something You definitely didn't play proper StarCraft My man's slack over here Not only does he have a beautiful name, we play pretty great StarCraft. He stayed calm, he waited with the MULEs until the perfect time, did solid macro pushes You, however, forgot the probe almost the entire game First build order, pretty good You know, I'll give you that Build order was tied, except for the part where you didn't build workers You had negative micro on the Adepts as is a very common theme in this series Probably would have been better to not try to micro them at all Just kind of aim of them and they would have been absolutely fine Forgot to warp in Stalkers there Then you didn't scout for about 10 minutes You blindly thought that he was going into Air Terran, which wasn't the case You built Archons, got absolutely blasted by Thors. Thor's, all of your engagements, except for the first two were pretty god-awful Even the second engagement was really bad You used half of your army every single time, either just the immortals or just the air Never at the same time When you did use them at the same time, you actually completely blast that fight You never build a single arc on Do I need to go on? Like, I can't help it that your opponents didn't follow the script that you had in your head Okay? That's going to happen in Stargraft People make different choices sometimes And that is completely okay However, however, what isn't okay is offensive Gigiing, sending in an imbalance complaint form while you suck so much as you did. Because you, my friend, really do suck Nice All right, boys, let's wrap it up Thanks for watching Don't forget to hit the subscribe button, hit the like button, and hopefully I'll see you all next time for a new video Bye-bye."

        "video_id": "TOCvB9wA0MQ",
        "text": "Dear Harstam, I am a big fan of yours Too kind TVP is so hard to play I believe most Terran, includes me, has the same situation that we spend most of time on practicing TVP, since the latter is full of Protos, and get the lowest win rate on TVP I want to say tosses every unit is Inba, especially Colossi, Disruptor and Carrier I am not saying there's no way to beat these units, Terran can win, but the DOSUSS, difficulty of control is not equal In this game the opponent just use the Phoenix Colossus build, sit at home, build lots of cannon and nuclear battery to defend and transform to Airtos He means transition. I know it's impossible to win this by midgame push, so I just try to restrict this expand and expanding myself I do get economic advantage by doing this, but when he gets 200 army supply, my army just like paper He easily destroyed my army and pushed from his base to to my base finish this game The thing that makes me feel unfair is that what he do is simply A-Move and use Disruptor VVVVV, which is the hot key for purification of the spell that disruptors use But I have the EMP, Split Army to avoid Disruptor and shift carriers to win the fight Some pro-Therent can do it, but it's too hard for me. I apologize I did not say G-G, but say in by the end of the game, since I really feel upset at that time Well, first of all, this guy is Monukuma, Grandmaster Terran on the Korean server First of all, Monouma, I want to compliment you on something You seem to be more self-aware than 99% of the Terrans that send me emails I get emails from bronze players that truly believe the reason they're stuck in bronze is not because it looks like they're playing the game with a single hand with the brain of a two-year-old chimpanzee, but because of imbalance And with you, you do have self-awareness You say, hey, I know that at the highest level, level It is impossible It is possible. But for me, it feels like the control is way easier from the proto side And that is the reason I am losing, not because I played worse necessarily, but because my opponent's race is just a lot easier So this isn't even really a complaint about, hey, this is in balance But this is like, hey, it's what he is doing easier than what I am doing And he has a lot of self-awareness in this entire piece He even apologizes for not saying Gigi Usually people say things like they do the trick apology, you know They say something like I said imba because I felt like he didn't deserve the win. But this guy says I said imba because I felt very upset at the time He recognizes his own emotions and he realizes he handled out of that emotion, which I think it takes a big man to admit that But enough talking from this useless content creator from the Netherlands Let's just move straight into this game All right So we have, well, we're a Grand Master Korean level These guys will know how to do build orders And I think he was around 5-1, 5-2K MMR So pretty decent player, you know, nothing to scuff at But it's not going to be, it's not Maru You know, Maru's like 16, 1700 MMR more, something like that So it's like, I should be capable. I feel qualified enough to handle this I don't think I need the help of any of my friends yet If you get anything above this level, then perhaps we're going to I need some guys where I need clam or euthermal to truly explain to me the intricacies of the Terran race You know, like hey, what's wrong over here? That's basically what I want to But here I feel comfortable that I can still kind of do that What do we have here? We have standard pretty, well wait, this is a Nexus before core, I guess Still pretty fast core It's because he didn't scout early on, walked straight into a Reaper. ProTol's not the brightest bulb in the box but then again a lot of people have been opening up with Marine first and sometimes you just kind of autopilot I can't I don't even mind it too much this looks well it's probably gonna be a Stargate because he said he opened up with Phoenix Colossi on the other hand we have our man playing Reaper into double Marine so double Marine what you do with double Marine is you kind of stop your opponent from moving out or if your opponent moves out with the adapt across the map you'll have two marines it delays your reactor a bit so delays marine production um but it does give you some nice defense against a faster that the thing is is that on romantic side is not really necessary the map is huge um so i'd say not necessary but i mean it's a it's a creative decision you know i'm not going to complain too much about that there's just a small point of people are aware of like hey this is something he could have potentially done different follow this up with um what does he follow Okay, well, he sees the Stargate. Still gets the Hellion I wouldn't mind if instead of building the Hellion here, he decides to go into Tech Lab and go Cyclone Viking But on the other hand, the nice thing about Helion is that you can scout the third base So he sacrificed his Reaper to get the tech So now he knows, okay, I'm going to need a mine Okay, mine tech lab, I guess And then a Viking here. but he can still see whether there's a fast third base Metafak okay this is very odd and this is very risky and I don't really like it usually when you like then why do you scout if you're not going to change your plan anyway this is the entire point of scouting instead you can adjust your plan to what you're seeing the nice thing is that usually the Viking comes out just as this bad boy arrives so Marines hold one base and then your Viking holds the other base Now he even sees, even sees the Madovac A Viking is just simply better, in my opinion Better at stopping everything and you do need some units Yeah, he's going to get a Viking now. Yeah, I'm not entirely sure about the META, but it's something, you know, that if he doesn't lose the Madovac, I don't even care too much The opponent's getting immortal It's pretty afraid of some type of push, I guess I kind of wonder what he's doing here So I've seen two more depots on It's kind of getting some oversupply And oversupply as Terran and Toss is really bad As Zirk, it also sucks But as Taryn and Toss, it really messes with your infrastructure So with Zirk, you won't have money to build units But as Toss and Taryn, it just delays your infrastructure So not only is this base delayed, this is actually really painful, but also Barracks 2 and 3 are. super delayed look at that that is just he has so much oversupply and all of these minerals invested in depots are not really paying off anything for him it's like it's laziness basically 69 out of 102 that is just really painful he's going to get even higher so the build order just isn't very tight here i'm not saying that he could have potentially done some type of push but he really is lacking raven Okay, so he should be scouting with his Hallion and should have been scouting if there's a third base The moment you see no third base, you know it's Phoenix Colossus. There is nothing else that Protos can do, nothing else that TOS can do from two base with an Oracle opener, unless it's like a blink all in But 99% of the time this is going to be Phoenix Colossi, especially at this level And he immediately should realize this Because of that, he kind of should have known that it's Phoenix because the lack of a third base I'm not a big fan of this raven The chance that this raven is going to mean anything in this game is very, very small And the own And mines? So, mines generally suck against Phoenix Colossi, because Colossi outrange minds massively You can't really drop them because Phoenix get air control. So all the decisions so far in the early game have been crap just bad decisions from the initial scout response to then afterwards not realizing there was no third base knowing that that indicates that there's a phoenix a lot of the decisions here have been straight up crap we see that his stim and combat shield is extremely late there is zero pressure on the protos player here you could say well he opened up with triple cc yes but even with triple cc you see that the top terrants will hit you at 720 735 in game time with like 135, 140 supply, with plus one done, with two, three tanks, and maybe even a raven That sounds like a very fair push. That sounds like a push that's very normal, even with one, one, like, and hitting with that We don't see that being the case here at all We see our man isn't moving out on the map whatsoever He's not going to be in time for that type of three tank push. That type of three tank push could have some potential if you keep your raven alive but on a map like Romanta side I would not recommend that and I definitely wouldn't recommend continuing mind production if you know that your opponent is playing something like this with the heavy Phoenix Colossi style with the very late third instead what you want to be doing is you want to get map control with quick um flexible units that are quick to change direction change rotation on the map basically and expand quickly yourself and then perhaps when you get 2-2, think about a mid-game timing onto a potential fort base This is something you can do. Or if you prefer playing like Klam does, you can get a fast second starport before Armory, way faster than this, and start pumping out Vikings, or getting a fast Ghost Academy, start pumping out like six Vikings and three ghosts with the enhanced shock wave while getting a fort base and denying your opponent's force That is something that Klam would do This push hitting almost a minute late with Wait, did the Raven die? already Of course the Raven died, I'm not surprised With only a single tank is not going to be able to do anything You have no, no push in this army Okay, look, what is this? My man scans five cannons, two batteries. He knows he's playing against Phoenix Colossus, or at this level should be able to deduct that, knows there's going to be, it's eight minutes in game, like there's going to be some type of splash How are you going to push into this without tanks? Like you don't have the range This means you're going to need to attack into this with your bio force You have nine marauders and 26 Marines If there's any type of splash, you're going to lose everything Even if it would have been stormed, this wouldn't have worked But it's obviously not going to be storm It's going to be colossi This is like if you're stuck in a fire and behind you, there is a fire escape. And in front of you, there's a door and it's lit on fire And you're just pushing into the door with your hand, trying to open the door again and again There's, ah, freaking burning my hand over here How can I escape? It's like, it is just so stupid, and there's absolutely zero reason for you to do this You just don't have the range to attack into an army like this And don't forget that the moment you scan, five freaking cannons and two batteries, we can do some simple math, potentially some simple math Five cannons is 750 minerals Two batteries is 200 minerals add those two together, that's 950 minerals that are wasted or invested into defending this area. That means this amount of minerals is not invested into infrastructure It's not invested into units More cannons over here All of this money is not invested anything The moment I always tell myself when I'm playing PVP, if I see three cannons on my opponent's base, I get a free nexus. if you like that is the type of thinking you should be doing in your heads like hey i see five cannons here if i don't use this area to attack into that's an investment my opponent is not getting back and i can even snowball that like if i see he's investing in this case is 1,250 minerals or so i can get like two command centers and that snowballs my advantage more into a midgame even It's a example I wouldn't actually recommend getting two command centers, but that's the type of money trade you can do, like if you don't attack into it. Now, instead what he does is he's like, hey, my opponent invested a lot in defense rather than finding an alternative way to get ahead, let me just push into this defense to make sure that it was worth it for him So here you see that this engagement by itself kind of made this investment worth it No fort base on the way, builds the fourth base on the third base location rather than on location He sees his opponent is only investing in defense You can play as grie as you want You can throw down a CC here You can throw down a CC here Why aren't you doing that? No, instead, save as Don't get me wrong I like CCs on the high ground. I like CCC's here But not in this situation You need to be able to think situationally at this level We're talking Korean Grand Master, my friend This is not Little League anymore You're here with the big boys now, buddy. it's time to step up or step down you know what I'm saying see mine still here as well no alternative form of harassment either no like mine drops sure there's two cannons here but you can dodge that go over here try to drop in the main base get a few very often okay I like this very often harass in TVP doesn't even necessarily give you damage or plus plus like positive damage so it doesn't necessarily give you 30 you like worker kills But what it does give you is it gives you information You see, hey, something is researching here That's nice What is that? Then you go in here and you see, hey, hey, there's carriers building That is interesting. That is something that interests me very much. Even You get scouting information This is the first time since his Reaper went in that he got any real information That's because of the lack of harass It's because he didn't want to go in And I can understand that when there's Phoenixes But if you're pushing here with a big army, maybe you can send in a little mine drop into the main base or into the natural into the main base Like, cannons are static defense That means they can't move unless you're a Zerg player and your buildings can seem to move, no problem Nice static defense Zerg. Why does no one ever send an IOTIS form about that? Just like, hey, why is it called static defense if it can move? I would immediately just go, like, that would be a 15 second episode that would be like just clapping And I get all the Protos pro gamers just to record like a 10 second session of them clapping in front of the cameras It's like game set and match, you know? Like, completely fair, but no one thought of that No, instead they're complaining, these guys can't move Just fly around it It absolutely makes no sense It's like a guy with no legs chasing you with a knife It's like, it's not that dangerous, you know? It's not possible He can't move. It's not possible Did he just attack his own probe? It does seem to be the case We have two two upgrades, Ghost Academy, three Vikings This army just doesn't make a lot of sense, does it? Okay, so if you're gonna push with a slow pushing army, like this is a slow pushing army, okay? I respect that Let me just explain the thought behind this So what you do is you shoot from a day distance into static defense while you have enough Marines to kill all the interceptors And the tanks are doing the hardlifting You know, they're killing stuff And when he attacks with either interceptors or with Phoenixes, you have well-upcrated Marines to deal with that. In that case, what you need is, A, probably more tanks, which is why I didn't really like the mines initially You need a couple of Vikings, which he does well And maybe even slightly more Marines But having some marauders, like 12, 13 marauders, isn't even that bad On top of that, you add turrets into this push Turrets are such powerful static defense against air that it becomes very difficult for the Protos to attack into that position If you manage to deny this base without losing your army and slowly pushing forward, yeah, that's a big freaking deal Someone like Maru does this a lot. I know that because he did that against me, like five times, five times when I played him last winter in TSL I played this style I know what the weaknesses are of this style And the style is poor economically It is difficult to get bases going And once you start trading against the Terran army, it generally becomes bad for the Protos player However, there's no static defense here He just denied a fourth base He's setting up his own fort, his own fifth base It's getting more batteries I like that Where are the upgrades for air? I would have preferred seeing attack upgrades, ship weapons. But at this point, basically what you're doing, you're sending out an army on the map, which is this army had a goal of the, denying a base or attacking a position, very slowly sieging it, basically setting up a position with turrets, with bunkers, maybe even a sensor tower so you can see movement, and then using the tanks to siege forward He used that successfully here, minus the turret part But then once he pushes up here, rather than using this same mindset, he just kind of starts moving forward a little bit too far, in my opinion, with his marauders and with his Marines Now he's doing it properly again Okay I kind of like it Without turrets, it still is very, very tricky. And you could say, well, you can just throw disruptor balls from a distance That's true, but it's very tricky to hit tanks with disruptor balls And on top of that, you can't ever engage into it if there's like 12 turrets here And Luke, he definitely would have had the money to get 12 turrets here That wouldn't have been an issue. And every time you kill a tank with disruptors, the other guy can just rebuild the tanks because I mean, our man has two factories two tanks are in the back currently so this fight should be really good for the terran if there is five six maybe even seven or ten or twelve extra turrets here all of the interceptors will disappear your vikings will do all the work shooting down the actual units even now the fight is kind of fine like you're fighting you're trading which is good because you're outmining your opponent so massively He's getting Thor's? Oh my God This is the type of guy that fell asleep when they explained that Thor's are not a thing against Toss. Thor's actually just suck against Toss, okay? I'm sorry to have to break it to you Also, can I just have a quick look at that fight? What did my man actually do? So he was, he kept talking about, let me read what he said I'm just, I'm getting pissed off already He easily destroyed my army. The thing that made me feel unfair is that he simply, a move and use disruptor vvvv but i have to e mp split army and shift carriers to win the fight okay so he mentions three things emp split army and shift carriers what did he do in this fight what actually did he do in this fight he moves up okay it's just what this first person this you know let's just first person this okay what does our man do he has no emp so that's one of the three things that he complains about he doesn't need to do he forgot to build ghost okay No ghost He doesn't split his army against disruptors He just runs back. And what are his Vikings? Oh, can we get a zoom in on the Vikings here? Are these Vikings shift-clicking carriers? Or are they just aim moving into interceptors? Look at them Look at them Does this look a Viking with a mission? Or like a guy that is fighting off mosquitoes, like when I'm going for my run next to the water? That's more what it looks like I don't think these Vikings got a single targeted shot off This was their first targeted shot He didn't do any of the things he was talking about Zero, none of them This is rewriting history, my friend I know the good type of rewriting history. Usually I say that the winner writes history, but apparently the loser can also write history, as long as no one fax checks him Fact checks Well, I'll accept it See, there's a Still Still is in a fine position Is a hat just get a second armory, get ship weapons upgrade, continue upgrades, his opponent is only on plus two, pretty crappy mining You're completely fine, dude He could have continued with this plan of just tank, Viking, Marine EMP I mean, it worked out while getting loads of marauders, not having any turrets It's really not that hard to just shoot with tanks, the tanks shoot by themselves I can't assure you that I tested this many times in the unit tester. They actually do shoot by themselves Thor's are just not the answer Thor's are not the answer And the reason for that is because disruptors scale too well against Thor's Thor's are very good against carriers, if there was only carriers But once disruptors are there, Thor's actually don't scale very well, because the toss can do this crazy thing, which is just throw the balls at the disruptors, and Thor's are difficult to split because they're so slow I admit that they're difficult to split Just play Viking Marine Ghost. could add some marauders and get like five tanks and just push with tanks or with with turrets as well it's such a powerful combination look at your upgrades on the Marines the damage output of these marines who by the way never die against interceptors the way that you fight heavy marine viking armies would be with storm not with this type of army it's getting cloak does you have enhanced shockwave yes enhanced shockwave still not getting any ship weapons instead it's getting two extra EMP machines i also like this by the way this is a good move you understand what doing but the rest of your this is cool if you have two armies of similar size that are doing this on opposite ends because then you're multitasking very often terence this is this is very often when terran say that they're multitasking really what they're doing is they mean that they're out on the map with an army that isn't their main army this isn't multitasking this is single tasking with your second army being at home everyone does that okay multitasking is if you have two armies. This, I kind of like this, except rather than having five tanks with this army, you have freaking four thores or how many? Yeah, actually, which are completely useless Like you literally only three, four tanks, then the red, then you force your opponent to attack into you Right now, you can't siege your opponent because you have nothing to siege with Your army, I'm not too sure about this fight, actually It's going to take out this base, but It's going to be rough Let's take a look A couple of EMPs going down Good EMPs, I have to admit He didn't stim yet It's going to stim now Turrets are putting in some work There's no Vikings, once again. I don't think we've seen a single split here I don't think we've seen any Viking targeting And the Thors are completely useless because their upgrades suck Yeah, this is just the win for the toss I mean, I'm And even then, it's not that big of a win It's like, it's, it was a semi-close fight Like, resources lost isn't that far off If you just had mined more and gotten a slightly better army, the resources lost is really even Once storm gets into here, I'd kind of agree that this army is difficult to beat and it becomes really difficult to engage, but that wasn't the case Like this, he had no intercepted This was a really close fight. Except that you just had so much supply wasted in Thor's rather than either in Vikings or more ground units, your turrets weren't done yet And you didn't have enough tanks really to shoot at the disruptors If you have three, three, four tanks here and you just micro back Okay, so let's just have another look at that fight Okay The way that you want to fight this is that you don't want to fight the ground army, because the ground army is good against Marines So what you do is, is you fight the interceptors, and all you need to do is dodge the disruptor shots, and you run back towards your tanks, and your turrets. So either this guy needs to walk into a tank range and he loses the disruptors, or he needs to attack without the disruptors into the turrets and the marines, which will just destroy interceptors Instead, what the terran does here is, look at it, is that he just stands forward, he eats half a disruptor shot Turrets are helping a bit This disruptor shot, okay, that's just the disruptor shot that kind of kills it. So he didn't split, his Vikings didn't target once he did E&P so he did one out of the three things he forgot the stim temporarily at the start as well I mean I okay I'm actually gonna give him something here you know it's game it's not even over yet at this point by the way what he could do at this point what the way is right now is you rebuild Metafx Marine Marauder and you just go for base trade mode there isn't a lot of static defense on these outside bases and there's not a lot of mining if you can just force a base trade you actually win as the terran here instead he's going for thores which are slow units now what i am going to give to him is if you get into the situation where there's storm disruptor colossi tempest carrier mothership and a second hand for that so you need six types of units um and oracles seven types of units it becomes very difficult to fight for the terran but not because the control is harder but because the army of the tost is so all around tempest with a large range but don't forget tempest would need a separate control group, oracles would need a separate control group, disruptors would need a separate control group, the main army separate control groups. And they already mentioned Storm and Storm I think you need four to five control groups to control that army properly So it's not even that easy to, like this is an easy army to control, but it's not a very good army And you can see it in every fight Like the army is bigger. It is fighting against a guy that doesn't micro at all and has the wrong army composition and still the traits are relatively even like I really am willing to give it to you that I think the toss fights are easier if you get to that late game stage where if you hit a storm on Vikings that's massive and an EMP doesn't do the same because it doesn't inflict real damage it's just shields I completely agree with you there and I could you could even say that that ultimate late game is Toss favored maybe even a little bit imbalanced I could say but To say that these fights that you've been taking this game were easier for the toss, I'm not even sure if that's true. I can grant you a lot And maybe you could grant it to Zirk players, where the Zerk army actually is pretty difficult to control But the Terran army you've been building, you've just been one control group in this Every single time you engage, I see your Viking stutter step together with your Marines and the fire rate of Vikings and ghost is just very different It is not the same. I'm empathetic because it feels it feels difficult to fight this army and it's frustrating and it's annoying but I mean was this really that much easier for him? Did he really suck more than you? And did you really do any of the things that you said you did? Like you said sure I can't control perfectly but at least I did certain things. but really at the end of the day you didn't really do much of anything honestly you just kind of sat there and took it to bad engagement built bad armies got the wrong upgrades didn't realize what was happening for such a long time took bad's fight didn't snowball your advantage at all and i feel bad because i feel like this is one of the first people that have ever had in this series that was self-aware he realized he made mistakes he didn't He didn't seem too sure There was some nuance It was not a straight-up, okay, this is completely broken Toss is insane No, he was like, I sucked a little bit, maybe, and It's painful I wish, I could have. I really wish I could have, but my friend, as we're nearing the end here, and I guess you said what, this is Inba? I'm afraid that once again this just isn't it This really just wasn't it, my friend And I'm just thinking back, is there anything I can say for you? So your early game was good You scouted, but then you responded poorly You responded poorly to your scan seeing six cannons Your first move-out was bad Your second move-out was good, but then the second part of that move-out was bad Oh, yeah, yeah, here you go with the imba Your opponent wins. um i your fights are generally quite awful you started building Thors you didn't get ship weapons upgrades i don't think you have a separate control group for Vikings like i'd love to give this to you i really would but i'm afraid my friend that you just suck and that's just uh that's the way the cookie crumbles and my good friend Jim Carrey would have said that's going to be it for this episode. With lots of empathy, I say it. It's Korean Terran. Also, he is on the barcode, but let's not forget that as a Grandmaster Play, it can be difficult to send these things in because people tend to make fun of you a little bit more. So a big shout out to you there, my friend, for sending it I salute you That's going to be it for today If you did enjoy this episode, don't forget, subscribe to the YouTube channel Don't forget to hit the like button, subscribe, leave a comment down below What did you think of the game?

        "text": "Dear Harsden, the day on ladder, I ran into something that I did not believe was possible I was matched against a Zirk player But instead of being a human opponent, I believe the only possible explanation is that my opponent was actually a chimpanzee Now, chimpanzees for the people who don't know are actually the closest relative we have species-wise to human I believe researchers said that the DNA is like a 99% match with human DNA I think chimpanzees and behind that bonobos are very close So actually, this isn't even that unlikely Like, it's, it is a possibility that there are some Zirk players that are indeed chimpanzees At least sometimes seems that way, also at high level. So I'm not sure about Rainer, but he just play a bit like a monkey at times Where was I? Well, his build order made no sense whatsoever He went to base layer, did not use the layer for anything, and simply took a delayed third Okay He then took a fast fort base, but simply set his rally points on me and sent Roche Hydra across the map while, presumably, enjoying a banana This replay clearly shows that Zirk is far easier than ProDos I did not think it was possible for Apes to actually play StarCraft 2 and reach Master League Clearly, I was wrong if they select Zerk. This replay was sent to me by a person called All for One, who's a Protos player in European Masters, 4 6KM and 1. there's only one thing left and that's to hop straight into the replay so here we have mr all for one as my replay speed is a little bit low mr all for one here in the bottom right corner the the the blue protos player and he's going to be playing against uh well a red zirk player look at that this guy's playing a proper opener and both these guys are doing absolutely fantastic i'm i'm in love with this game already guys look at the first pylon go down at the correct timing the first overlord went down at the correct timing this is almost looking like one of my own games except that this guy what did he just do look at look at this move this is a classic move okay my man builds a pilot goes back into the natural or goes back to return the minerals then the other probe goes in to build the gateway he does a switcheroo he's just long distance mining. This is brilliant I'm not even sure how bad this is, but I've never seen this before You can actually, if you're fast, you can get minerals, run back to return him and then build the gateway in time But he has a different one It's not the most efficient man in the world, but you know what? I like it Some creativity here in the marketplace of ideas hosted by my man all for one Not a bad play Okay, let's see what this presumed chimpanzee has in store for us as Ogo Ogo I can't this name is also not making it great It is this guy is it is a real possibility guys We're keeping it open Okay. We're keeping a possibility of Ogo Ogo being a chimpanzee definitely open He went into hatchery first gas spawning pool My man here gets what he's playing real build orders Okay This is completely fine Now what I want to pay attention to is first of all, desert builder I want to see, hey, does this build make any sense? Because there's a possibility that he just went straight into layer, did nothing with it, and went into a third base So I want to look at that I want to see, hey, does the toss builder to make any sense? And I kind of want to measure these against each other. I want to say, hey, like which one was worse and presumably which one is supposed to win if we think about builders that make sense So far, I really like what this Protos is doing He's just, he's even rallying, well, as I say that he sends on into the gas, but he's kind of rallying properly Okay, never mind He just Well, why would he do that? What actually is he doing? This is not at all how you're supposed to rally I was kind of give him a compliment about rallying properly, and then I He rallies to the other side of him He builds a Stargate with a probe. He probably could have built that Stargate with the next probe that actually should have rallied down He just does a lot of weird things in his probe movement I have to admit I don't quite understand why he does them He's like the guy that invents the wheel again and then makes it a square He's like this is why people say don't reinvent the wheel because you're going to end up with a square It's like, ladies and gentlemen, I have a brilliant invention We can put this under vehicles It shows up with like, or maybe like a hexagon or something like that You know, so not quite a square It's better than a square, but it's still like the. It's like the Flintstones type of car I'm sure what type of wheels the flintstones had I think even the flintstones had round wheels, but they were made of stone Flintstones, meet the flintstones Or it's the flintstones? I watched a show like once or twice when I was a kid, but that tune was catchy, wasn't it? Yeah, I was like, okay, straight layer So my man Zerk goes into layer that gets scouted by the Protos player Now, I'm going to make a bald, a solid, assumption here, okay? And I think that the Zirk player wanted to do something with that layer, but then when he got scouted, decided against it. Okay? This actually is an intelligent play, because two-way's layer builds, when scouted, are terrible Like, they're just awful So, even though I think the build order of the Zerk right here is not good, I like the decision after starting with this, where he probably want to do some two-base opener, he decided to then follow up with, hey, I got scouted I don't think I can do anything here And he goes into a third base And I actually think this is a very good decision. And maybe we could even blame the Protos player a little bit for not continuing to scout with his adapt a little bit more, you know, seeing, hey, is there a third base coming up, what's happening? But on the other hand, how necessary really is this? I do like that he has pylons all across the edge So he realizes, hey, layer is is the thing that he's going for The possibility of erogenitis is definitely there So he's getting ready for that possibility And he has pylons all This is the opposite of an artosis pylon So for the people that don't know, an artosis pylon is a single pylon that covers a lot of building. So you have a single pylon powering like six structures, for example So literally, he can, do anything about that Now finally going back home And oh, there's one pylon powering all, oh my gosh Arptosis entire infrastructure has been shut down by a single pylon being sniped Army moves into the natural and it's Gigi Now this is the opposite of an artosis pylon This is the all for one pylon This is a pylon that doesn't power anything, which is by itself fine But then he puts a second pylon next to it that also doesn't power anything So now you have a complete useless pylon. I think we need a better name for that and I'm going to suggest you guys to leave a good name suggestion for this down in the comments below People that type are harsed in pie land will get banned and it's not funny No one thinks that's a funny joke, okay? It's not original, it's not creative It's the first thing I thought of you guys would do You guys are so uncreative that I can already see what your guys wanted to type There's three guys right now going, dang it, he caught me Can he read my mind? Is this live? No, you're just that uncreative non-foney, okay? Don't do it No one likes you And don't send me an email about it either. Okay? There's a little rant, not to do with this game It's a bit of a weird build by the survey, right? People that send me emails, very long emails, all in a sarcastic joke sense, making fun of me, are not funny Stop doing that I know there's two or three of you guys who do They send me long emails, and you just make, Iotis about my tournament games I didn't ask for this I don't find it funny You got to stop it Okay? I'm not responding to you Except, I guess now in a video format Well, that kind of backfired on me Well, this is the last time I'm responding to you guys I'm serious Don't send it. I completely thrown off right now I wanted to flame some people, but I can't remember where I was going at the game I should have a quick pass see what this guy's up to Forged Twilight A robot I don't even mind this build too much His work account is fine-ish It's a little bit low, but that's because he took his third base late because he saw two-base Two-base Zerk So I actually kind of like it His scouting has been subpar He has no clue Now he sees these roaches He can send the void race there, so that's nice There's a bunch of a depth at home Doesn't really have anything else. Why does he have so many adepts? Adepts are like this thing that falls off so fast The thing with adepts is they're kind of like the zip ties of construction You know, zip ties are great for certain things, but you don't really want to use them to build the foundation of your building And it's the same in StarCraft 2 They're great at holding your early game together But if the guy that's in charge of constructing a house, says that, hey, sir, in order to put these first two walls down, we're going to tie 70 zip ties together It's a good time to request your money back and find a different construction, man. So, yeah, don't get too many adepts, is what I'm trying to say Seven is really pushing it, especially if you're not going to use them to leverage any early game advantage you already were planning on On having, or you already had. these roaches come in do absolutely nothing you see these adepts actually being useful which is pissing me off even more the only thing i hate more than adepts being useless is adepts being useful because then people think that they're good i mean a single battery would have done more but yeah it's still good this is a very good start okay so the funny thing that or the thing that always strikes me as funny when people tell me that their opponent is playing a very suboptimal build, is the fact that they basically just admitted to losing to someone that was doing a very suboptimal build, which means that they must have sucked really hard after the early game Like, it makes absolutely no sense. It's basically like, imagine, okay, this is, this is a great analogy Imagine you're running a marathon, okay? And you're running against a guy that shows up two hours too late And then 200 meters before the finish, he catches up with you and he just sprints past you And then at the end, you complain, man, I can't believe I lost to this idiot He showed up two hours too late It's like, well, you kind of admitted there to being so freaking slow that this guy could show up two hours late and still be faster than you And it's the same here Like, this Zurich has played a god-awful build I'm going to just say it This build was terrible. But he's still going to win the game against you, which are the same Mr Perfect Build Order Well, perfect build order Don't even want to say that He might have showed up two hours late, but you showed up without shoes Because who the hell? Let me just throw up my table We'll find it out later You opened up with four oracles and three void rays You have no units whatsoever Seven minutes and 50 seconds into this game He also only has a single hotkey No No hotkey He has no hotkey There's no unit in the world This guy, he's getting aroused. armor upgrades? What did this guy smoke? Is that the thing he really thinks he needs right now? It's armor upgrades for his air This guy checks his doorstep He's like 35 hydrants and four roaches And he thinks the solution is to get armor upgrades rather than adding 10 cannons or something like that He's up like 20 workers Hasn't scouted that He has absolutely no clue How can you complain about this? Look at this Look at this movement He's just F-2ing them through his opponent's army That's absolutely fantastic to watch That's a great warpin as well These guys really did a lot This is unbelievable This is just absolutely incomprehensible. You know what the weird thing is? I don't even know what he really did wrong in a major way Like he just had no units, eight and a half minutes in the game You know? It's like, what do you say to a person that just builds nothing? It's like you can't really critique it It's like if you show up into your, imagine you had to make a drawing for your teacher And you show up in your art class with like a single dotted line in the middle of the paper Like you can't, the art teacher can't give good feedback Because there's nothing there Like, you just had nothing You did nothing You produced zero. If we were in a society and this game was your contribution, you wouldn't have contributed anything to society Yeah That's the worst analogy It's the worst And I know Hamster is not going to cut that out He has Storm finally, which should be helpful Storm is one of those spells that is beautifully easy to hit, but also one of these spells that people seem to always miss for whatever reason, even though it's an instant cast Oh, first two good storms, that's beautiful, like the opponent micros out, and then he morphs everything into Arcons Super Battery is it, realizes he has absolutely no units still Transers works to his fort base I love that this guy, oh, he's actually winning this fight. What the hell? Have I been jupped? I might have been juke No, I haven't been Back to not my crying Oh, both players are actually trying their absolute best to lose this game No offense, oh go, go I do like you, but Holy crap, buddy The move commands are getting a bit much Double upgrades is all for him Yeah, okay, so the toss just wins Wait, have I been tricked? Okay, he can just build. like yeah I was gonna say like four High Templar you had them maybe more of them into Archon maybe sir buddy like we need units right now like this is not the time to wait for eight High Templar to get energy dude you gotta be kidding me there's no way right is he actually just not gonna do it that is just wonderful He's actually waiting for a storm, not realizing if he just had morphed four Archons and warped in 10 more Zealots He would have completely destroyed this army Look at this He is one second He is one second away from having storm One second He waited all this time Okay? He waited all this time. And he decides as he hits 75 supply, that he morphed them into arcons Okay This is so insane This is, okay, this is similar to imagine you need to go to a place And the place is really close by It's like a 500 meter walk, but you insist on taking the bus Okay So that's basically what he was doing, right? He could have just morphed into Arcons and he would have been completely fine Instead, he decides, okay, I'm going to take the bus I'm going to wait for a storm. Then the second the bus arrives, he starts insulting the bus driver, pees all over the check-in machine, you know, where you peep your card, or if you still have the old guy that stamps your ticket, you just pee all over him And then you jump out of the bus with a backflip and you start running towards the next, towards where you wanted to go initially, where you could have run already half an hour ago And then you're surprised that the bus driver gets out and beats you up Bus drivers are surprisingly strong for sitting in a bus all day These guys, they have some, you know, some power You can see that often. You know, you don't want to be the guy that pisses them off in the end I think this is, this is, this was not great This was not, this, yeah, this really was not great You know what? I don't want to do this I, I hear we have a new reporter who's going to take care of this on Throw it over to Joe Joe, are you there? Hello Kevin, thank you very much for throwing it to me I am reporter Joe and I'll be talking about whether this game was imbalanced or not So let me take a look His micro, his micro was not very good. He moved commanded, a lot used a lot of F2 and in general it didn't seem like he controlled units very well His oracles did no damage, his void race did nothing and he also morphed Templar into Arcons when they could have been storming Two I think his macro was quite good He spent his money well and his early game builder It was fine We should not judge him poorly, give him a bad review on his macro I think that was good Game plan His game plan sucked He had no units He built way too many air units air units, even though his initial build order was good, he then just started doing random things without an amount of gateways. He spent his money relatively well for a long time, but what he was spending his money on made no sense, and it basically gave him a very, very bad army So, no The question was, is this imbalanced or does it suck? And I think the only truthful answer we can give is it sucked You sucked That's going to be it for me today Thank you all for watching If you did enjoy it, don't forget to hit the subscribe button, hit the like button, and perhaps we'll see Joe again in a future episode Wait, I am Joe And perhaps I'll come by in another episode if you get more than 2,000 likes on this video. Otherwise, Kevin won't be able to pay my salary in order to buy all these cool shirts that I definitely didn't steal from my girlfriend's closet while she isn't here and she doesn't know I'm doing this And I also threw the letters against the wall and it's sprawled across my room Don't show this to Irene."

        "text": "Dear Harstam, after nearing the peak of the NARCOM Grand Master Letter, rank 6, we realize that shield battery overcharge is completely and utterly broken It should have its cool down increased It simply makes no sense for ProDOS to be able to overcharge their shield batteries six times for a total of 84 seconds In the time it takes to execute a typical, completely standard, uninteresting, almost boring, proxy 4wrex cheese. cheese thanks p and keel slash yole bolson our first ever arkon game let's uh hop straight into it i'm very excited we've never had an arconde game before and i've never had two players complain about one thing at the same time well i've had many people complain about protos ertos in different complaint forms but never two people at the same time in one complaint from that so that's kind of exciting rank six grandmaster on n a um in Arkham So I guess their individual level if we can convert, what do you call that? It converts that to Europe would be mid to high diamond on a good day And that's not even including Ping. If they would actually be playing from America, I think they'd be floating somewhere between platinum and diamond Of course, don't want to give them American Grandmasters too much credit Now, now that there's two people, I think I can be twice, twice as hard on this them because if there's going to be any floating, any build order mistakes in a freaking proxy 4 racks, like, you don't deserve the win, my friend If you have two people and you're making that type of error, that's not a bit of proxy gate coming out of a Yama slash meta, who are the opponents, I'm quite sure what they're called I think you only get four characters in your name in Arcon. So just, well, I guess it's a standard proxy 4ax, like the execution isn't bad It is just, it is what it is It is a 4-Rex I'm a bit surprised that they opt to go for a 4-Rex strategy because this strategy, you can literally play, like, if you're an actual gorilla with only a single arm Like, this strategy doesn't require a second person It doesn't even require a second arm Some people say it doesn't require much more than three fingers The thumb, to move the mouse, and then the two top fingers to click the buttons, you can kind of move the mouse with those as well. fourth finger would be nice, a little more control of the mouse, but really that's all that's necessary I've heard people say that this build actually is executable by gorillas Now, I haven't tried it yet I haven't been able to find a gorilla willing I did find a couple of gorillas who did injure me slightly after I tried asking them So I thrown banana and slinging poop at me, but yeah, it's been, it's been rough, right? It's been rough So they're actually waiting to go That's also extremely interesting So they're playing this cheese build and rather than deciding to go as fast as possible, they decide to just wade it out of it They're not scouting with an SCV either. So this is just, they're picking a random timing here to attack This is not like some scientifically decided timing It's like, oh, when we hit the 8th Marine at at 2 36 we move out Not like, he could have just scouted with one of the SCVs The first adept doesn't come out until 220. So the second barracks that finishes you can just send that SEV out and see hey what's going on they would have seen nothing here and they could have just gone in cancelled these cancelled these batteries most likely did he see that I think they saw that two pairs of eyes guys two pairs of eyes oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh two pairs of eyes what were they looking at well like now I'm curious we're gonna have to go through the sequence three times so this is player one Look at this This is his vision Okay He's looking here So he can't see it in his straight vision, but he can still see it on the mini map Now, player two. What is player two looking at? This is the macro player He's building the marines and, but really he's just building marines There's nothing else Oh, I think he saw the edge of a stalker there in his vision Okay, so two pairs of eyes, not paying attention to the mini map, not paying attention on their own screen at least one of them Not sure who that guy is though, I wish you could call them out on their name, but you can't see who does what action At least not in this overlay So he finds these two stalkers going to lose a couple of Marines I like that one guy's job is just a micro, and I haven't seen a micro once. Like, none of these units are actually being pulled back None of them All of these Marines, they just stand there, they stutter step forward You'd assume that if a guy's entire job is just a micro-managed this, it would go better. but just like in actual life whenever there's a manager that perhaps micromanaging every single unit is going to be best the results tend to actually not be great because most managers actually have no clue what goes down you know at the normal people workplace it's middle management ugh disgusting you know what i'm saying i have a lot experience with that as well um all my life i've been working uh you know blue color white color jobs It's not like I've been a pro gamer for 12 years and really didn't do anything before that I have a lot of real-life experience I like to flex that every now and then. I thought this was a good opportunity to create some empathy with my audience, a connection The common denominator, or common nominator, what it's called Look at these marines going in Look at these marines go in They're going to, they could target I'm not even sure what you're supposed to target I just should go for the batteries Yeah, you probably should have gone for the battery immediately And then now you go for a couple of stalkers I do like that This was nice micro Like, good target picking by the Terran here He decided, okay, I first want to take out that battery, especially the super battery is important. Not the greatest micro by the Prodels, but the Prodals just, I kind of do want to stress this The Prodals player kind of has a blind counter to what the Terran is doing He stayed on one base and was just producing units from two gates against a 4-Rex proxy. like you're just kind of supposed to win so far by the way the super battery hasn't really contributed much to uh to this game i mean the battery just got taken out after it got activated it didn't really have an impact yet i love the i love that he just keeps going he's like i can't just walk up this ramp sure there's three stalkers i know there's another battery in the main base but yeah let's just keep keep walking up that ramp again and again that's exactly what he keeps doing Actually, he's getting a lot of results with this as well It kind of surprises me He's going to take out a bunch of these workers. I'm just not sure what the second guy is for Wait, what? He had a supply drop? Okay, so there's one guy is in charge of move commanding the Marines and then right-clicking on stall at the correct times And then there's another guy that literally has one job, and that is clicking the Marines with the hotkey that he has for the barracks and then with the hotkey has for Marines and making sure he doesn't get supply blocked And he failed at that How's it even possible? This is the easiest build to execute You're going to be floating a little bit of money Like you constantly are floating a little bit of money You see, you can even already start the next Marine. You have so much time Was he just watching the Marines fight? Maybe this is not an arc on as we know it, but it's just one guy doing the job, and then the other guy just watching from a distance to learn, you know, and then they swap after every game I can't believe they had to use a supply drop here Holy crap How mentally deficient is this guy? Let's continue here Yeah, we have a couple of gateways Second overcharged battery here is being used The probes are coming off the line I'm kind of surprised that they are I don't think they should have been I think the Stalkers would have been capable of handling this fine. I'm also a little bit, I find it very funny that these two Protos players, that already got their natural up, you know, they're just pumping out units It's four Stalkers against six marines right now This game is really just kind of over Two base against the one Yeah, this kind of is just supposed to, and I like this movement though The TOS Micro has actually been quite good, good kiting, good target fire majority of the time Oh, needs to be careful here This is a little bit unfortunate for the Tos players Keep pretending like it's a single Tos player, but it is really too Yeah, this was unfortunate Again, I kind of surrounded by that marauder. On the other side, of course, there's a lot of DPS Warpgate is about to finish up Maybe we're going to see some I don't think we're going to see any war connection here, actually Probably just need to be defensive A couple of pings on the mini map, though I'm not quite sure what those are for I guess maybe that I'm here is where the other guy spawned. I'm well it's ranked six grand master arc on and they should know where the other person spawns on romantic side look at look at my career and bang bang shoots beautiful pullback on the marauder do you see that saw that the marauder was getting focused by everything decided to not pull it back here once again beautiful that is so great just kites it forward every single time it really is impressive i really find it impressive that one person can have his full attention on the task and then just not do anything Like, he's just watching his units go It's just so beautiful. I also kind of love the, what would you call it? Like, how natural it comes from for Terrans that whenever they do some type of cheese, is that they're just supposed to win. It's like Terrans always have this type of, this privilege, basically, where they're like, if I execute a build order, no matter what it is, I should be able to win. And no matter how well prepared my opponent is, or how good their build order is against mine, this should just be a hard win. Look at this. Because of the Supply Drop, and because these guys, it just built a Supply Depot here. If there was no supply drop, instead of two depots here, these two adeps wouldn't have been able to gotten in So this actually is costing our Terran team, a Crapton They're kind of go for an SEV pool at this point But yeah, I'm just so, this really is something that Terrans do, okay? I'm not over exaggerating But I had it as well where I got proxy repop. like Forex Proxy Reaper and I scouted everything and I responded perfectly okay I chrono boost out my units I cut workers I build a battery and don't forget proxy Forex Reaper is a big cheese I build a battery and you know I defend without losing much of anything and then my opponent complains is like well I wonder what would happen with this strategy if this game was actually balanced I'm like well if this game was actually balanced and you proxy four of your initial structures on the other side of the map I scout everything, do the perfect response, and don't make any micro mistakes I hope the God that I still win that game. Like, you don't hear any of the Protos players that Forgate or Cannon Rush every single game And when the Cannon Rush gets stopped, go, well, if this game was balanced, my cannons would be shooting from my natural into your maze Like, no Like, we realize that we're cheesy pricks and, you know, we accept our loss Like, holy crap, just man up, woman up You know, just accept your defeat every now than Taryn players You're pathetic All of you Yes, I'm generalizing, but that's fine when you're talking about Terrans These guys have no soul No offense Well, kind of offense No soul Actually, it's a pretty big offense I love the micro from the Prodos though. This Proloss has been doing a good job at kiting and target firing, but his movement has been a little bit off I have to admit it Okay, the movement hasn't been great Now, we have Stim about the finish here for the Terran We have two batteries We have very little units Actually, very little units, but with Guardian Shield to Immortals, can they just hold this? I guess this is Stim is very powerful I think it needs to pull the workers as well Guardian Shields, Forcefields, four The two guardian shields And not even at the main part of the Army Super Battery gets used a little bit too late as well I actually think the Terran is just plowing through this. This is not great Super Battery once again gets taken out before it gets to finish everything um good pro was this a good pro pool i think when he saw that the sceivs came came down all the way he should have just stood at this ramp with with sentries right and for like your opponent is losing so much income if you just kind of hold your ramp with sentries you're going to be completely fine once again i'm liking this micro this toss has nice micro good control really good control it's just that the unit movement it's oh okay that was not it Oh, that was not it Oh, good Lord, that was not it. I take back everything I said, hello, folks, the battery? Sometimes I wonder if Terran players actually finished elementary school, or as a collective, they just didn't finish it Like, let me explain this, okay? The battery has less HP than it heals And you also have the super battery, which gives even more HP than it heals. So if you are free to target a battery and you're not losing it, any time or damage targeting the battery it's always best to target the battery letting it stay alive it's just dumb it makes no sense okay i'm glad we got that out of the way um another miss force so that's kind of painful and now we actually have him oh no that's how we're gonna die oh the battery that was big that was big i pull the workers put the workers put the workers oh target target oh beautiful target shot that actually was really big that was a very important shot we now six workers against two but mules are still working this is an intense game by the way holy crap absolutely intense game okay what are we doing here i mean i feel like the terence are almost winning for supply that's what four marines three marines one more on the way super battery being used for probes And he's mining. He has to, though He has to mine He's going to go for a stalker rather than for a battery Or rather than an adapt It was waiting for money Terran sees the battery, sees a stalker, and with two Marines, decide, hey, let me stim in and give a couple more shots before I realize it's time to run away Why is he running down? No, no, buddy No! No! Kite, kite? Back to safety Back to safety Kite Shoot once Shoot once, my friend Don't go down, don't go down You can camp the ramp, though You can camp the ramp He's going to, he's going to, you're going to lose No, no, no, no, don't chase. Is he going to survive? Okay, he's going to survive No, no, no, no It's like every single time he runs back to safety He goes back into the lion's cage, into the lion's den Escapes it just to come back Oh, this is, still has a super battery, I guess It's going to help out Target down the Marines Oh, oh, no, he's going to go instead for the marauder first I think the Marines have more GPS here, my friend, and also easier to die, easier to kill Quicker to kill Needs to be so careful here One more shot Scoot micro Really, his single stalker control is really not bad I think people might underestimate this, but this ain't easy He's doing a nice job. This Terran really hasn't microed a single unit in his life yet No Wait, does the Terrans just win? There's no money He should cancel that worker If he can't cancel that last worker, I can get a zealot It's not enough How does the Taryn lose this? He still has a mule It's gonna be mining I think Toss loses No shot These guys Oh my god, I usually don't do this, but These guys, okay, these are the lowest, these are the lowest guys, okay? They send in a replay in which they drop supply in an Arkong game while playing a 4-R-R-X They win the game even though they didn't micro their units, even though we have a complete guy in control of microing. And then they have the audacity, the audacity to complain about Protos batteries How dare it? This is the problem with Terrence, guys They're so privileged Even when they win with a strategy that's not supposed to work, they get completely blind-countered They still have the audacity to complain Now, I think I've said enough about that, and we're going to go back to our second-time reporter Joe Joe, what are your thoughts? Alright guys, sorry for that You see I've been promoted to Inba Inspector after my last fantastic call Today we're going to be having another look This time we have three things All right Strategy toys, macro and macro Strategy choice You went for the 4-Rex proxy even though you're with two people. Two people can do different things in different build orders Here you only really could micro and macro Why would you do that if you're playing an art? Argon game You guys are ranked 6 Grand Master in Arcon and this is what you decide to do That an A letter can't be too good You guys get a thumbs down on the strategy choice Macro Your macro sucked It's really all it says It sucked One guy in control of everything didn't even micro Just stutter stepped a bit No individual unit micro No solid target firing Thumbs down. Macro Garbage I'm not making the rules guys, I'm just reading them Your macro was garbage At a supply depot had to drop it How can you get supply blocked? You don't have to do anything All you have to do is build supply depots and build marines It's two actions With 10 APM you can do that You failed it You my friend sucked at the macro Altogether Suck on the macro Suck on the macro Suck on the macro Suck strategy choice You guys suck Bode yow All righty guys if you did like this episode or visit him or do I suck, don't forget subscribe, don't forget to hit the like button and I'll see you all next time.

        "text": "Dear Harsdom, today I encountered a zirk that went three hatch before even getting a pool After scouting, I cancelled my nexus and decided to all in However, his overlord watched me put down three gates, so I did a weird three gate rush, then nexus It's not a build Regardless, I put on heavy pressure, destroying his army and tech buildings, hit after hit, after hit As his unit lost that doubles mine, and I move up to four, to five Almost six base, which is five That's already almost six There's nothing in between five and almost six Whatever Versus his two and a half He starts producing lurkers, in which I have zero answer for due to lack of detection. However, after quickly popping out some ops, I still can't touch him Sure, my upgrades were non-existent, but I didn't invest, because he was constantly on death store, and he killed my forges Zirk's ability to mass-produce workers slash units on less basis is simply imba or dot dot, dot, do I suck? Name, Zui, race, protos, league, diamond, and last but not least, he is an American So from the American server, replay is titled, Zerk is Inba Let's open up this bad boy So we have top right, Zui, the man, the mid, the legend He says, lurkers No, he didn't say Lurkers or Inba, he said he lost the lurkers. What he said, however, is that it is Inba that Zirk can produce infinite units from two and a half base He also mentioned that his opponent was doubling his unit lost step I don't quite understand how I can square these two things, but I'm looking forward to this game I really am looking forward to this game Usually when people talk about the power of Zirk production, they talk about them having too many hatcheries and just being able to just drone up and with larvae, just pop out units whenever they want But this guy is complaining about how effective the Zerk army can be of two and a half basis while bragging about having better units lost that. So these in my mind are two claims that completely contradict each other inherently But Zui figured out a way in which these two worlds don't collide, but they can coexist peacefully And that is something that I would like to see So here we are Zui versus Deaver on the American server. So we puts a second Corona Boost on workers and doesn't use it it's one of my all-time favorites first of all the second chronobo boost before Nexus is not a thing and if you are going to do it at least build your 20th probe in time all right buddy just write it down real quick in your notebook gets a Corby for Nexus okay then throws down a Nexus himself Corby for Nexus is very popular if you're playing against pool first, but my man hasn't even scouted the pool yet Now, according to him, he's going to cancel his nexus here and then add two more gateways Now, this makes no sense. The reason why this makes no sense is because Zirk always gets three hatcheries They always do By the timing you're hitting with a three-gate attack, the triple hatch will already have kicked in The weakness of triple-haping of triple hatch before pool is against things like a single adept crow node out Because you don't have enough queens to fight them, basically Your links might be a little bit late These are the things that are good against it Triple hatch before pool isn't even great economically for Zirk A lot of people actually believe it's worse for Zirk, and thus they don't play it because it's just, it doesn't serve a big purpose at all. He even blocked the first base and he forced the Zerk to expand over here now if you just sense the first adept to this base look at it this queen isn't even going to be done yet and he's already like 30 seconds too late with his adept from a core first a core first adept nah it's gonna hit at around like what 340 335 then he goes into the natural rather than going into where the drones are going to be which is this base could have checked that with a probe as well of course he finishes the shade doesn't kite with the adapt be shading That was some nice guiding It was nice Shade out, shade out Keep cutting Shit out Keep guiding. Shade out Keep guiding It's going to lose the adept now It was not the worst trade though If he hadn't lost it and his opponent built 12 workers The problem is that he cancelled his nexus So his nexus delayed These two extra gates have done nothing whatsoever yet He could have built this amount of units from a single gate And then his nexus would have been done a long time ago already He would have been up five workers at this point. usually around this time you have like nine to ten workers here already on your natural and you're busy taking your third base and really all he got so far that inflicted damage on his opponent was a single adept which you could have gotten from a single gate as well so i agree with him when he said this is not a build i have a feeling i'm not going to agree with a lot else in his email but he was right when he called his own build not a build it's slightly over saturated in the main by the way you want to say slightly oversaturated i mean seven too many workers here he's not saturating his gas he's not producing any workers and actually know what he is doing one of my favorite things in starcraft is checking out what people are doing when nothing is happening and in this case i have absolutely no clue selecting his gateways okay am i actually on his vision he's just okay yeah i was on his vision he just wasn't moving the camera for this long Okay, he's getting charged. Right now sees the extreme oversaturation in his main base, starts rallying into his natural, has a third gas, even though he's researching charge and only warps in zellets Five extra probes from your main base should be sent to your natural right now for more optimal saturation Continuous worker production is of the essence, very, very important You don't need this much gas when you're playing pure zealot builds or builds mainly focused around zealots, which definitely is the case It's just going to be floating a lot of gas and rather than getting that extra simulator, perhaps you could have gotten an extra gateway or something like a robotics facility to reinforce quicker with a prism, for example Staying at home got supply blocked. You love to see it though Here comes the transfer, nice Very timely Only took him two minutes And I guess we're going to see the push soon that will will what did he say that will put the zirk on death's door i never heard that before i kind of like that sounds uh sounds nice like that type of uh that type of speech puts him on death's door so that's nice case gonna move out here it's a bunch of zealids his opponent has a bunch of workers not a whole lot of units better upgrades though for the jerk look at already getting one-one plus one melee and plus one range a couple of roaches on the way this is the fort bay is going to get taken out This is an extremely late push by the way Six minutes with this It's not very good It's not a very good timing. There's no reinforcements He's only on five gates There's no upgrades behind this You could hit way harder, way faster with this Trust me Could probably hit at like 440 with something like this or like 4 450 This amount of zealous, a couple of stalkers It's actually just winning the game though The game actually is kind of over, especially if he would have had reinforcements or would have sent these across the map Another thing you could do is force fuel this area and move towards the third base to kill all of these workers Another thing you can do is while roaches are killing your zealids is to start focusing the Evo chambers with parts of your army. So right now we see what is the Evo chamber I believe is 900 HP So he did about what? 450 on this Is it 200 on this? 300 on this I can't count It's about 800 damage on Evo chambers Now, a roaches 145 HP So that would be about, what, six roaches, I guess? Five to six roaches of damage that he put into this Evo chambers instead And add on the snowball effect of losing roaches faster You can see that this push had a lot more potential Then, what, we add four gateways So fill this push, but he's still kind of okay, right? Work accounts pretty equal Just the upgrades of his opponent are a lot better Okay, it's gonna go again. Still not quite realizing that perhaps having closed by reinforcements might be valuable Even just a pylon with like a gateway would be sick, you know? Now everything needs to walk so far He's adding the four gateways as well Like this is the type of timing that makes no sense Like absolutely no sense It's like starting a war after you just invested your entire economy building more schools in your country Like he just, he just built what? Four gateways started Blink and started a third nexus Okay? 600 minerals, 400 minerals, 150 minerals, like 1,150 minerals, a bunch of gas None of that is invested in this army right now And none of that is going to help in this attack. Can you imagine this attack with 1,200 minerals more of units? I can't imagine that There would be 12 more zealots So 100 to 1 zealot So it's always very easy met for someone like me who didn't finish elementary school It's very nice of Blizzard to do these nice, big round numbers 12 more zealots in this army would make this 23 zealots, two archons and one stalker against 17 roaches That would have been an extremely big win for the ProDos, okay? But instead he's investing in things that will feel good for him, right? He'll be like, oh, like, look at me, I'm macron behind this, good infrastructure, I can spend my money But it didn't at all assist him in this push. This push benefited zero from that, especially because he's keeping these units at home I don't like, I don't like recommending people to use F2 But when this type of stuff happens, the all-army hotkey is so useful because these guys are just chilling They're just chilling You could warp in the next warpin already as well Look at this And he's still almost winning these fights, which is what's messing me up even more I also am not really feeling like he's dealing hit after hit blow after blow or whatever he said It's like he traded with his opponent and he traded well Okay, I'm going to give him that But his opponent was ahead in workers the entire time and does in Eco. The opponent is still mining more And his opponent has been up in upgrades is getting better tech right now Like, he hasn't been doing any hits He's been trading army while being behind an eco His opponent is on four base He's on two and a half base, which is weird because, yeah, okay, he's extremely oversaturated I'm looking at the worker count of like 64 That means this base should be saturated and these gases should be saturated But instead, what I'm seeing is seeing 10 workers here, some slight cases of oversaturation here My man, Zui's knowledge of efficiency, all of the knowledge he has on the subject could probably be put on the back of a stamp Like, it's actually pathetic. Look, here we go again Look at this These archons Making sure that this hatchery goes to half half Health, health Look at this If he gets the hatchery with this, I'm actually going to be pissed Because this is not how your archons should be used Okay, halfway through, he decided. it's not worth it anymore how much damage wasted like 1k damage wasted wait how many HP does actually yeah 1500 thank god that was right we're playing this game for 11 years don't even know for sure what amount of HP and hatchery has but 1500 was correct forget he literally just dealt a thousand damage with these arcons and arcons have splash don't forget he could have used that to splash thousand damage he just wasted it's unbelievable did kill a lot of workers this time around though insanely far ahead at this point when it comes to Eco Not so far ahead when it comes to Army Actually, he has a pretty small army Luckily, his opponent is giving away a couple of units. Is there Storm yet? No Storm? It's getting double forge To the left side here Okay, interesting 11 minutes in game, double forge His opponent now is on two and a half bases, and he is going from four Soon we'll see five, and then almost six So I think he's just going to stay on six, a five base forever This is beautiful 129 supply No upgrades No real vision of the opponent either His opponent is setting up for a desperation attack 38 workers, doubling the economy every minute that goes by He just doubles the money of what his opponent made in that minute Look at this The supply difference already How is it a good idea to attack right now? It's not. It's not a good idea to attack right now It takes out this base as well the funny thing is is that he could be mining so much more sure he's on four base but he's freaking 12 too many workers over here he's what 11 too many workers on here he's barely mining this gas he's already so rich he's already outmining his opponent so far so much and he still could be doing more if he just transferred workers oh hamster ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ladies and gentlemen we have a winner among us our first three nexus I have 200 energy None of the Kronoboos have been used in over four minutes Big congratulations to the winner. Your big prize is going to be Immortalized in an IOTIS episode And on top of that, every letter opponent you will play against, who recognizes your name, will make a joke about your lack of Kronobo's usage Congratulations to Zui Wow, wasn't that exciting? Even though he's saving all of his chronobo boost, and he's completely oversaturated, he's up 20 supply, he has an army that's pretty massive, he's outmining his opponent These things went down at 10, by the way Let's not forget about that These things went down at 10 He could have already finished 1-1 if he would have started 1-1 the moment they finished Let's pretend that didn't happen though Let's just pretend Not aware of his opponent's army. I think he might know that there's lurkers, but I'm not sure if he knows yet I think he's seen it, but I'm not sure if he's seen, seen it, you know, if he, if he truly ate the information, you know, he digested the information He already ate it, but he didn't digest it yet That's the most important thing, the digestion Something goes wrong there You're going to be in trouble Trust me with that Just going to get a dark shrine Okay, storm Always smart when behind dark shrine, when equal dark shrine and infamously said as well, went ahead Dark Shrine So Zui definitely sticking to the rules here Okay Decides it's time to kill that base, but not really walks up here. Okay, he sees Lurkers Now he truly has seen Lurkers He's seen the spikes hit his units He moved out of it So I know that he's aware of it Let's take a look at the reaction time that it takes for him Does he even have a robot? He has no robot For him to even start a robot, what was it? 1330 You know what? We'll give him 1345 Oh Well, and if I gave him 1345, it took him only two seconds Back to 1330, boys Remove the lame reverse effect I will end you, hamster Unbelievable 13 overlords? Huh There's like a dinner date setup, like speed dating and he needs more people in there or something like that. Bainling nest on the way right now Okay Upgrades are actually looking kind of spicy on the side of the Proloss You like to see it 2 1 2 Or of the Zerk, sorry The Prodo is getting 1-1 14 minutes in game Four minutes after he started the Forges Has seen Lurkers? Okay I wonder if he's going to attack Inton2. lurkers one more time or what the plan is he has storm he's getting 90 T's right now okay can we get a couple of storms why did he run from the hydras oh my god he has so much money you think he's gonna spend the money on anything was his gateway count is nine gateways we probably add 10 and still be fine okay these guys oh observer starts nice nice gets caught completely out of position also nice Where's the DTs? Sniped overs here! Snipe the overs! Oh, but the Lurkers! They just killed the DTs anyway That's a pretty terrible idea Imagine if you would have sent the DTs to the other side of the map what they could have done. Right now the amount of defensive units is Well, there's a Hydra there, two queens Very close to zero And now these DTs, defensively, are also doing something That's nice Five more overshears here on the way, they're going to take a while Okay He's using the DTs wisely I like it Perhaps start tacking into something as well Like he has the key to victory here and it's in the bank He actually has the key to victory and it's in the bank I don't understand what he's doing Why isn't he just building gateways or adding a robo way for disruptors? Disruptors are such a good counter to this You can also just make infinite zealots and get immortals. Did he lose his upgrades before they finished? Probably could rebuild the Forges And with the speed that he starts research, though Probably will take another 10 minutes before 1-1 is finished I'm not sure about moving into this This opponent does have way better upgrades, no? Look at the money, though This is like if you're extremely sick, and in order to get treated, you need to pay the doctor, like 5K And in your bank account, you literally have $5 million, except you forgot your pincode and you can't access it I feel like that's what's happening here He's just not accessing his bank He literally lost his card and his ID card And he doesn't know where his bank office is. And he doesn't know how to use a phone. That's what this game is like. He has so much cash. And his response is to build another. Oh, this is almost sixth. Look, this makes sense. Okay, I think I understand it. One, two, three, four, five. And if this base would have been alive, there would have been six. So it's almost six. This is different than five. Mystery solved. Good storms. Actually, good storms. Too cool. Those are really good storms, actually. These are fantastic storms. That was really nice. That was great. That actually was very, very well done. These storms were good. It says, okay, these storms did a lot of damage. I know my opponent still has four overshares because I see them with my observers You know what would be a good idea? Rather than adding a couple of Templar again, how about I warp in 40 Ts? Oh, this seem smart It's actually going to be able to clean this army as well Look at the money, 5K in the bank That's 50 zealots 50 zealots, guys Can't imagine what 50 zealists will do in this army? Six lurkers. three hydras and 32 links against 50 zealots even with the upgrades that we're currently at which is 221 two range attack and one carapace and two Malay attack I still think the 50 zealot would be able to win unless you come in in a line and you hold position in a line like in formation you know which wouldn't even surprise me too much if Zui would do that at this point Like this, six lurks just going ham It's getting bailing speed Five more overs here, just in case another single DT shut up I feel like overlord speed would be good He's getting out There's so many upgrades This guy also hasn't been on two and a half bases at all. Like, he's actually been on like decent base count, just low drone count Unit Loss tap is even So literally the only thing that matters is that he has a massive bank Oh, but this is the sixth. sixth this is the almost seven then or is this almost six he tried to get a sixth but it didn't finish that makes even more sense I was losing all of his observers like oh freaking lurker so broken I fly my observers straight into hydras and okay I take back what I said earlier maybe the three hydras would have been able to snipe an observer even if there were 50 zealids what does he keep adding on stalkers another quick tip by the way if you're really struggling with lurkers and you have 3k in the bank what you also could do is you can counterattack Because lurkers are not good when they're not burrowed. So if you force the lurkers to move constantly and you just run away and attack bases of your opponent, that's real nice What's less nice is if you're just constantly running away from them while you're losing a base You could be doing this on the other side of the map where he's constantly trying to defend his bases and you're constantly trying to attack into them You just run away once you see the lurker spines That's an advanced That's an advanced setup though It's an advanced trick You need to buy the course on my website Right now, it's called Harstam for 35% off www harstam com for my advanced trick guide It's a single storm here. Single observer? The observer's going to get sniped, isn't it? Again, no vision Oh, gosh, darn it His opponent is just mining fines, actually outmining him right now Unus lost, opponents also had by 6K Honestly? Honestly Honestly I feel like he lied a little bit in his imbalance complaint for him Or did he mean with the double the units lost, just the first attack? In that case he didn't lie But it just doesn't have observers Like, he has no detection Like, just because you really want to see the lurkers doesn't mean you're going to see them Like, you need an observer It's just one of these things, you know? This guy would have been the world's worst inventor. Just thinking that if you just hope long enough that it will happen If we have to trust on this guy to create our first plane, like air flight, like commercial airlines definitely would not be a thing thing or any type of airlines wouldn't be a thing It just walks in Oh, still no detection Let me try to bump into it one more time He forgets GG Well, just leaves without Gigi as all Zooey, zoooey, zoooey, zoooey, zoooey, zoooey, zoooey, zoe, zoey, zoey, zoe This wasn't it, my friend This wasn't it I'm not entirely sure what you're going to get I'm going to leave that to the new reporter Joe? Are you there, Joe? Joe? Hello? All he does is eat vegetables. Never ready for work Joe, you're fired All right I'll have to do it then, I guess So, um, what I want? What do we want? Three things We'll judge you want three things here Build order Uh, macro So your, your money spending habits And, and, um, And last but not least, let's just do vision slash detection Detection is part of vision, right? Let's start with a first on build order You open with something I've never seen before You cancel your Nexus to go three gate, but then you don't use the three gate You just have them Then you get your Nexus again It makes absolutely no sense Your entire early game was pretty hot garbage. You can literally just follow any guide, any build order, and you're going to get more units you're going to get better units and a better ego I'm pretty sure I could hit at the timing that you hit, but have like an extra base and 30 extra probes So for the build order, you're going to get a big fat Boom No stamp You suck Your build order sucks Second, your money spending Well, as you were saving more than the average person on the Swiss bank, I'm going to have to go ahead and say, well, your money spending habits also weren't great You were constantly floating 5K, somewhere between 4 and 5K It just wasn't looking tight, my friend. You just, it wasn't looking tight, okay? Money spending, boom Big suck First one was a medium suck Medium suck, big suck When it came to vision, I don't actually think you once managed to get any vision on the map You were constantly out of observers You were constantly out of position I don't think you were aware what was happening as well. at all you're a bit like a mole but at least moles have good other senses you know they can i think they feel with their nose or something like that they're out they're also underground but i can't see moles are blind so that's why they look a little bit off as well blind animal bats also are blind but bats have echolocation did you know that echo location first got denied that it existed by i believe the u s military because they couldn't believe that an animal could have such sophisticated technology that it took humans so long to invent That might be a lie, but it could also be a fact Wait, this I owe this. Crap detection, no bad echo location, blind as a mall, big suck What do we get if we put a small suck, a medium suck and a big suck together? You suck, just in general It sucked You weren't good my friend Zerk isn't broken 2 and a half base Zirk isn't broken you just suck gonna have to live with it alright that's gonna be it thanks for watching I hope you didn't enjoy this episode of is it Inba or do I suck if you're sad that I fired Joe be sure to leave that down in the comments below be sure to hit the thumbs up button if you think that firing Joe was a good call that improved this segment bye-bye Thank you."

        "text": "Dear Harstam, you know it, I know it, we all know it Terran's defensive options are outrageously powerful and require no execution to perform at a high level of efficiency, and I'm not even talking about walls You'll see what I mean soon I opened by following your guide on parting's early at that timing My execution was poor, but I did manage to get in and do some damage without quite sealing the deal I ran with my advantage, and by the eight-minute mark, I was doubling my opponent's supply But the extreme efficiency of widow mines and PFs as both defensive and offensive tools allow him to even up the game after I take one bad fight. From there on out I admit I was outplayed but how is it fair that Terran has tools that can erase such a massive advantage at all at once just by sitting there If you had any doubts before I'm a hundred percent confident that this replay will convince you that Terran is indeed Imba and that I not suck Love, weirnful All right, so he says, widow mines and planetaries are too strong defensively and offensively He had one line which I found very interesting, and that's that he said The defensive options are powerful and require no execution But that is always the case with static defense, is that they just shoot by themselves Spine crawlers, spores, cannons, batteries, they all do what they do. without requiring any execution to perform at a high level of efficiency If anything, the battery probably has the highest level of efficiency I guess you do need to do something there You need to click the nuclear battery to make sure that it spins like a madman But anyway, enough talking Let's just hop straight into this replay Wormhole versus Cringer Cringer is our terran player Wormhole is the man who sent us the email And he said he opened up with the part parting build order Now, the beauty of the parting build order is that I know its timings. If he told me about the wormhole adept attack, I wouldn't be able to judge it as well, because I don't know quite when he wants to hit with the wormhole adapt attack But part thing, I know, we want the three adept warpin at 3 80 Yeah, 318 and 3 adept warpin Then we have five adepts total, one stalker at home And that basically is it. Like, I'm familiar with this build order and I can really judge this build order because I know what is good and what is bad about it so let's see he's already doing a good job not chrono boosting his first thing is rallying this uh this nexus down to the i'm not quite sure what cringer is doing I think he's gonna play cc first but then I'm not sure maybe cc first in my god okay it's happening everybody stay calm what's the procedure everyone what's a procedure all right i thought it was going to be cc first into proxy barracks which i mean this is platinum level so this type of stuff is still possible but it's going to be proxy cc first into barracks at home so kind of the opposite what i expected um this could be for a hidden base in theory but I'm not question anyway we'll deal with what crincher is doing later okay first we have a look at how wormhole performs so so far he isn't performing too poor second pylon is being proxied all looking very very tight this could be an eBay as well and that he tries to fly this in to turn it into a planetary I've heard of this build at lower levels I am not I haven't really seen it executed yet At least not that I can recall, not in IOTUS. I don't really watch low-level games in general, but this Okay, it's going to be in eBay, so this has to be a floating planetary Okay, Cringer Oh, wait, one second Let me pull up the imbalance complaint for him There was some foreshadowing here You'll see what I mean soon And then he also said, the extreme efficiency of widow mines and PFs as both defensive and offensive tools When I read that, I was thinking, I don't think widow mines are that good offensively, but whatever But my man is talking about the aggressive planetary float This game just got a lot more interesting And I'm really curious, actually, because this sounds stupid, but I'm not even sure how bad this is if the planetary lands. I think the main thing is that there is this one trick that planetary landers hate and that is when you walk under their command center with a probe Like, it's just a hard counter to what they do And it's also not easy to hide a planetary or to hide a command center Like, a barracks is relatively small, can fit in many locations But it's not like you can just put the planetary behind the mineral line, you know, like, put it over here and then float it Tadda, I'm here Don't like It's a huge building So if you scout for it, when you see nothing on the other side, he sees an eBay as well He's going to be so confused. He's actually really confused His early game actually isn't too bad, by the way Like he forgets, I think he forgot one chrono, but it's not the end of the world Now he's going to need to respond quickly So on the mini-map, he sees the command center Okay, you pull workers and you walk under it That is the trick here, my friend You pull workers, walk under it Okay, grabs an adept At this point, I don't actually know if there's anything you can do as provost Like, the planetary just goes up I think this is just a bad situation I'm not saying that the game is over, but I don't think you're going to be taking your natural anytime soon. So then you just counterattack, I guess, and you get like a Stargate or something like that This is a brilliant building Take a Nexus here This is beautiful Is he going to get range as well for it? I know there's a range upgrade Increases the range of the planetary by like one Okay, walks in with the adepts on the other side Has two bunkers here as well This is a great build, though a great build though You know props to Cringer for for making a play like this This is good Floats the planetary in and says all right this natural now is mine Didn't really think about having anything at home though Two adepts Going to finish up the shade Nice. In this type of situation, I wouldn't mind if it just, he has a lot of money, 900 minerals I feel like he's just sitting and not doing much of anything I just microing the adepts, I guess Yeah, he's just microing the adepts Now, very often microing things is good, but what's even better is if your opponent only has a single Marine, is to warp in three more units and just kill him Like, he's been floating a lot of money for a long time already This warping probably could have happened 45 seconds ago He would have had, like, it's nice that your opponent has a planetary in your natural, but it's not like he's gone a long-distance mine with 20 workers at your natural. You know, like it's just not as effective as you being on one base So if you deny this base, you're going to be completely fine. There is a Widow Mine here I'm surprised how slow he is with walking up. Actually I'm very surprised how slowly he is with walking up. Oh gets hit by one Widow Mine but I mean There's no Armory so it's still going to be visible. I wouldn't mind if Cringer does build an Armory here. I did another Factory it's a Bunker as well. This is a fantastic set I love this setup. One Marine per Bunker a Missile Turret a Planetary Fortress. He's building workers I'm not sure if that's for repair or if he wants to kill these things. And he's like well that's the only unit I can really build here this Widow Mine well well not not quite the most brilliant thing that I've seen in my life but it's also not the worst. I can put on the sound by the way I forgot about that. Armory is on the way and once that Armory is out I'm actually gonna be a little bit afraid because then these Widow Mines don't die as fast anymore needs to be very careful because these Zealots can't walk up there's three more. What is the Gateway okay is five Gateways he has a Stargate I still think Wormhole is just winning really hard. And you know what is so great about this bunker? This is a bunker that is defending nothing, okay? Let me just pause here for a second This bunker doesn't defend the ramp It doesn't defend this area You can just walk by into the mineral line It doesn't defend any of the factories either You can attack it with stalkers while being out of range of the bunker this bunker is really just keeping the Marines and an SUV safe This bunker is just acting like an idiot magnet And it seems like Wormel is very attracted to it currently, which, yeah, I'm not quite sure how happy you're going to have to be with that, you know? That is not a positive. I mean, he's going to get a lot of worker kills At this point, the armory is done, so these mines are just going to keep shooting A good trick, by the way against mines is if you can't see them and they keep shooting at your units is to not walk into them anymore This is kind of an advanced move though It's where if your opponent has a fortified area and a non-fortified area, what you can do is you just say, hey, rather than attacking into this meaningless bunker and these three mines, instead what I'm going to be doing is I'll just walk by and keep killing all your workers and make sure you don't have income. Okay, this is the famous eight minutes that we're about to enter He said after eight minutes, I'm doubling the supply Do you know what the worst thing is, is that he walks into a position pretending like he wants to go through with it? Like if you want to attack the bunker, you can tank two mine shots and attack the bunker But instead what he keeps doing is he walks into a position, then gets attacked by a mine, and then doesn't even go through with the move This is He lost so many units already to these mines There are mines with four kills here Well, there's a mine with four kills here Four kills, one, one What's this? Also one. There's like ten kills on these mines divided Like eight, I don't know Counting's never in my strong suit There's no drilling clause on this, right? No, no He could also Just walk to the right Like, oh, whatever If we now would evaluate this situation, okay? What, you run out of Marine? Oh, that's just great He actually did it just to kill the pilot He built 10 workers to build a pilot What I was going to say is if we evaluate this situation, we're in a situation where you're up probably about double supply, double the workers, but your opponent actually is mining more because he's going to be able to long distance mine He has mules at home. And he has a planetary in your natural Oh, he's going to run up to this He has an or he has a starlet He could just build an oracle and revelate all of this Stalkers outrange mines Fun fact, actually Stalkers do outrange mines Mines have five range Stalkers have six Centries have five Centries are not a good counter to mines Stalkers are There's an observer on the way He built a Stargate? You didn't build anything from the Stargate, right? I can say I've ever seen this before Yeah, I mean, the planetary I can agree with I understand that you didn't know how to respond to the planetary, but the mines, I thought I trying to change it up a bit My man, Cringer. I'm a fan of this guy Cringer, you're cool I like you I do really like you Um, I thought to try to change it up a bit All right, observer is coming in I should tank on the high ground though So at this point, it's going to be really tricky actually to kill the mines from a distance I mean, you can probably still do it You have about eight stalkers It's going to take a while, but eventually you should be capable of doing it But it's now 11 stalkers And you could just aim of this Just make sure you don't right click on top of the ramp Yeah, they shoot from a distance It's quite nice. Make sure you don't get scanned and lose it Yeah, he moves back with the mines I think I can just go in What army is there really here? There's four mines Yeah, you just go in and you win the game Exactly what he's doing right now Just right click No, just write the tank What? He actually acted like an AI This is Have you guys ever played like a tower defense where you need to make mazes? This completely works on Wormhole He just went all the way around the maze and even got stuck for a bit like a bad 20 2005 AI He was like, wasn't sure if you should go here or here This is ridiculous He's a tower defense AI. The tank was here He could have moved the stalkers here, right-click the tank 11 stalkers, one shot a tank At least five stalkers would have been able to shoot Even in the worst case scenarios, if it only would have been four stalkers I think it actually was like seven or eight, but even if it's only four stalkers that can shoot, you're still going to three-volley the tank That's better than taking 12 shots while you're finishing the maze And then once you reach the end of the maze, not having enough power anymore to kill anything He did eventually get the tank There was an awful fight He's down four and a half, four K resources. And he's being outmined because there's a planetary in his natural Now he builds a void ray He's like, huh, maybe if I get a void rail, I can clean up this building that doesn't attack air By the way Planetaries don't shoot up This is a high level game Vehicle plating Okay, I dig it, I dig it I dig it I get a Let's see if he's going to try to right click this turret as well and go like this, fioril all the way around I can't believe it, the personification of a tower defense AI I didn't know these people actually existed. Now I wonder if this guy just based his life around the AI or if the people who made that initial AI based their AI on Wormhole These are really the questions Kind of like what was first the chicken or the egg, the wormhole or the tower defense AI That is ridiculous I love this so much Look at it I really like that he only has three units to micro and he keeps stacking them up so that the planetary can really splash on it This is actual quality He could have done this eight minutes ago by the way His Stargate finished at like the five minute mark and he constantly, he constantly, he could have done this eight minutes ago by the way. His Stargate finished at like the five minute mark. constantly has been having money he's still up in supply which is pissing me off even more like everything so far in this game has just annoyed me does it have range no right plant every range is pretty big actually no buddy it's good cycle on micro nice come on right click it uh almost had it that actually would have been nice if he had gotten that how many more times is he gonna walk from up here to down there to up here to down there it really is impressive he has no clue where he wants to be in life he's the type of guy that starts four different studies in a year you know and has three part-time jobs at the same time completely different fields confused why he's never getting anywhere in life because he keeps quitting his job after two and a half weeks because he's going to look for something more challenging or something new has a sick resume though it's the same with He's immortals. They've seen a lot of the world, but they feel at home nowhere Always on the road Aye, aye, aye Through globetrotter Painful stories Starting a planetary at home as well See if these mines get another three shots Five kills, two kills, three kills These three mines have 10 kills What do we think? What is the chance that he walks, oh, well, by the way, I ask Yeah, send this one in as well Like, how does he not realize at this point that if there's an armory, you can't actually see it after you activate it? Maybe Wormhole doesn't actually know Maybe he isn't aware of this. So for the people who don't know, if there's an armory on the map, after mines shoot, they stay invisible Well, usually if there isn't an armory on the map, the mines do become visible And it, no, please no Okay, I was really afraid he was gonna send in the sentries to tank a couple of extra shots It would have made me so sad It really would have made me so sad This one goes down Command center and the top right, of course Makes sense I missed what happened and I want to know It's rewind time Well, we figured out what happened I'm not sure if I'm too happy I wasted another 15 seconds on that though. Loses his air, but I mean, I feel like I don't even really mind Usually I'd make a big deal out of someone flying a void ray into a turret But I've seen this guy walk into planetary fire 12 times, finish an entire maze before realizing he could have just shot from here behind the depots. and I have a feeling the party isn't over yet if you know what I'm saying I have you know I would criticize this usually I say why would you build a turret here but it wouldn't even surprise me if this turret is going to kill three void rays or seven observers that fly by it like it is an actual possibility here and it makes me very sad oh he's getting the range this I like this is the high sack auto tracking it increases The range of missile turrets, auto turrets, and planetary fortresses It's crazy Actually, the turret range looks so wild with it They get insane range Even though it's only one extra range, it really does look kind of silly. And tourists are really powerful People underestimate this Well, push There goes another widow mine Hate to see it Hate to see it Templar Archives I'm not even sure about the Templar Archives Usually I always say, hey, against Mac guys, Immortal Arcon Zelead is really good But this is not standard Mac This is the type of Mac where you need to range against it, you know? Like this is not even Mac, it is just widow mines and two accidental tanks I bet this is not confirmed, but I bet that these tanks were misclicks, you know? Just fat fingered them And that's fine I'm not here to criticize. cringer I'm here to criticize veraum hole I do like the name though we're wormhole wormhole sounds so boring but the wormhole I don't know it sounds kind of spicy I like it I do kind of like it oh look at it cringer's gonna send a couple of mines on the map meanwhile on the other side we have Vierm hole oh no it's actually gonna happen look at him he's controlling his observer is he gonna fly into the turret no shot He doesn't see the turret yet Come on Fly further, fly further What is the chance that this guy flies into this turret? I actually really wonder How's he not seeing this? It walks straight into his vision. What's he looking at? I really wonder what the odds would be If we were to ask like a, if we were to ask like a boogie, the chances of this observer flying into a turret, Like what would the payout be, you know? 2 05, 1 8? God, I wish I had a boogie on the line I could show him this replay and ask him this question If you're a professional bookie and you're in the comments, be sure to let me know what you think the actual odds would be that you would give me I think I would take the bet, no matter what. I think the likelihood of at least one observer flying into this before it gets taken out by units? I think it's bigger than 80% than 80% I'm I actually think it's bigger than 80% And that number I just made up, but that's fine Like he sees the turret as all, which is what is getting to me He sees, he's been seeing this turret for a long time and he's just ignoring it Okay, now it's actually getting dangerous because he's fortifying the turret The odds are going up Ah yeah, yeah, look at this, look it is It's in the army, Holtki You can feel it already You can smell it happening Look at this Same army hold key It's going to go into storm. I mean it is splash that can kill mines Fun fact you need two storms to kill a mine Mines have 90 HP and storms only do 80 damage So two storms usually is good enough Unless they preemptively start microing their mines or you miss a storm accidentally cast during your own probes Happens to the west I'm not going to lie Might have happened to me. some time in the past i'm very surprised not getting the turret though i'm very surprised he's not doing much of anything actually what is he doing this has been one of my new things that i have really been enjoying is just uh taking in the calm and serenity of low level games it's when you see these guys just moving their army around just clicking on the map you know just probably using the arrow look look look he saw that you saw that you can you can see the actual thought What brought Wait what? I want to see this again Okay, look at this So he looks at it, then goes back to his army, and you can see him do a double take. Like a turret here, army here Is there anything I can do there? And then he decides, you know what? I think it might be better if I just flank it from the side? What? Is he gonna flank a turret? A static structure that can't run away or move This is just highly impressive How did he come up with this move? He knows there's going to be one mine there He's going to send in No, okay Ah, quiz time, quiz time, quiz time, quiz time Put the screen on Blackhamster We have three options Option number one Is he going to send in a unit to tank the mine shot and don't go with his entire army That's option A Option B. He's going to use his observer and utilize the range advantage of the immortal to take out the mines So it takes a bit longer, but he won't lose any units That's option B Or option C, the final one, is he right clicks his army onto the turret, loses his observer and walks into mine or mines Maybe there's more at this point I haven't seen the overall vision That's option C Make your decisions It's the drums But I'm done with my tongue Okay, let's have a look Okay, Arcon goes in Thanks There's actually more mines now So he tanked two shots Then gets distracted by three cyclones But look, you can't distract this man. He's like these cyclones are annoying and I wish I could do something about it but he's probably going to go back to the task at hand, no? Or no? He's just chasing this He's actually like a corgi What do you call the guys? The dog Oh, no Option A and C at the same time He didn't lose an observer, though I would have lost my bet Didn't lose an observer Lost half an army into these mines Okay, well, I'm actually kind of sad that I lost that bed I really thought it was a very high percentage But he accidentally killed the turret before with an army that he forgot he had on the left side. I can't actually believe that he surrounded the turret, you know? A 360 surround all the turret tasteless That is something I haven't heard before But a first for everything Robo Bay, now I like this He is realizing, okay, I'm not having a great time with my Arcons because Arcons don't don't have enough range to kill mines and I can't micro my immortals individually Instead what I'm going to do is I'm going to get disruptors or colossi and both of these units have such a long range that is really easy to destroy mines from a distance I'm looking forward to it I forgot about this base. I've been in his vision for so long that I completely forgot the fact that there was a base on the right I'm surprised that wormhole is still ahead. How much did he lose? It's actually been getting closer that that turret with the mines wasn't it here for cringer okay there's liberators on the map oh here we go wormhole to do to do do do did didi di di di di di di pram bro did didi preembron take this salad oh it's going to die tush is there an observer with this army other is okay good i like that so far in this game literally the only unit that has been built on the other side has been the mine like you look at the the units lost 20 mines, more mines have gone down than marines. Okay, this is not, you're not supposed to send in an arcon to scout, okay? The Arcon is a highly expensive unit You send in a zealot or a probe How is this possible? What happened with the Observer? Oh, it's here no shot this one will fly yeah of course oh hey hey that's great how many observers have three so far I think personally I think we'll see more than six observers lost this game personally oh oh oh You know what's going to happen It remains funny Oh Ah People around the world sad It looks a bit like a What do you call these guys in the sea? Like a jellyfish, doesn't it? The other day I went to the beach, actually. It was loads of jellyfish in the sea But no one was afraid of them So I figured they don't do any damage I always thought that jellyfish can shock you or something like that But these guys, they didn't look very scary at all Like, I saw like kids just jumping And there's loads of like, loads of like this big as well well The jellyfish was very close to touch and he was like dodged him because I'm too fast You just see me in the water man I'm fast like a shark Also big like a shark The people are afraid of me like a shark When I get too close to them, they tell me to go away Like a shark. But yeah, people didn't seem to really appreciate me just putting my towel down next to them Hey guys, it's okay if I join you Grab one of their beers grab the aux cable, well now there's everyone, everyone uses Bluetooth I just push their phone out of it and my tunes Yeah, it wasn't really appreciated, but I think it's because I have such intimidating loops You know, big like Arnold, that type of stuff Maybe intimidated by my intelligence as well Also possibility I love that this guy is just sending mines all around the, all around the basis, just, just turrets He really hasn't done much of anything, I have to admit He's getting battle cruisers now. Yes, plus one ship weapons, plus one vehicle planning Both of them at the same time realized, hey, you know what would be cool? If you get air units I really like that wormhole decided now He got the robot baby Didn't get anything out of it, right? No upgrades, no How do you go units? You? No, nothing He hasn't used it, but How many kills this going to get? Well, all kills He's going to kill every probe One Two, and a three, and a four, and a five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, yep, eleven, eleven Oh, you know, oh, nice, yeah By the time all the probes died, he decided to respond Twelve workers Here comes a mine Look at the multitasking here, though. Well, the lack of multitasking from wormhole, really Still making sure Oh, trying to chase the liberator Oh, gets the final shot off Oh, no, see, another thing under attack Did he realize? How many kills did that mine got? Five No shot There's no way he's actually going to go there So, yeah, what I would say against mines is you just get a single disruptor And what you can do is you can just, or two disruptors, you can just shoot at the mines from a distance, and it can kill multiple mines at once And there's actually nothing that Terran can do If this entire army consists of mines. is this one trick that scientists hate or Terran's hate that only build mines is this going to get tectonic destabilizers? What's the up? He has no upgrades on his army How is that possible? 27 minutes in He has an observer here and he decides it's better to use one storm He's going to lose another unit into it This is unbelievable Does he see it happen? What is he doing? Oh, he looks at it He's like, oh, he's still there Oh, no Prism, observer, observer, observer, observer I'm just so confused what's happening in this game I'm actually so extremely confused Because nothing is happening They're just, both of them are sitting. and the weird thing is is that Wormhole isn't even losing I actually think Wormhole is winning he is freaking 13 Tempest against two battle cruisers and nine Vikings if he gets like 10 stalkers underneath his army these Vikings will be used this he can get a couple of stormers to storm the Vikings like how in the world is he going to lose this cringer just keeps going with the mines man this guy has no chill couple of bases on the outside I'm a personally I'm a cringer fan or as the zoomers call it the cringer Stan I am following him on TikTok for a while now he's some legendary place here go to battle cruisers here go to Vikings I mean this can't really work this type of fight just with this army like you're gonna need some minds with it because tempers are just completely gonna stomp you like actually just blast you especially if there's one or two arcons underneath, like it's just going to be complete ownage. You'd actually be surprised how good tempest are against Beto Cruz Like you have one shot all of these BCs and then your ground units will just own the Vikings Like it's not even going to be close I guess the problem here is that Viramol isn't aware and he might just lose like a base before he responds Or maybe he walks through this At least it's a zealot Nothing else Yeah, yeah, this is this Okay his army This move I'm not too sure about I like the stalker warpin I do like the stalker weapon Look at this I don't even know what hotkey you need to press for half of your army to stop moving to the location And he's still winning the fight. Half of his army wasn't there, half of his tempest just didn't arrive and he still destroyed his opponent Now what you could say is hey like maybe we want to see, oh he knows about his base Why doesn't he just go there to kill it? That actually is Sam Oh he's going to go No he's going to go Five more tempest on the way He has stormers and he says, okay, I'm going to move towards the top right side and I'm going to win there Or I'm going to move towards the top right side walk into mines and turrets and loose There's two possibilities here and I'm really curious to see what it's going to be. Utilizing his range, even the observer is being used here This is good This is actually really good I like this We're officially 30 minutes and 37 seconds in game and this is the first move that Wormhole did that I think wasn't bad This is a good move This is a game-winning type of move Okay, it needs to be careful Is there drilling class? Yeah, there's drilling class Actually really needs to be careful This was perfect Why couldn't we do this before with Immortals? Oh, no, wait Is that the sixth? Number five I said six, I think He could have done this like half a year ago with an immortal and a single observer as well. You just need to pay attention to your units Make sure they don't walk into things and you're going to be completely fine fine Oh, more stalkers? I actually wonder what the upgrades are going to be at 1-1, plus 2 for air only That's the one thing that the Cringer really does have, has been doing a better job at, huh? Oh, 16 Vikings He's actually Cringer's getting a scary air army You need to be careful, because if they get a too big air army and you don't storm well and you don't, you know what's really sick? Guardian Shield here Because Guardian Shield gives you armor and battle cruisers attack very quickly Armour is really good also really good against Vikings obviously with their peo-pues. But yeah, if you just hit like one or two storms, he saw his opponent move out Like he's seeing this, you know? He's seeing this move He saw it Well, I'm not sure if he saw it, but potentially he could have seen it There is a possibility There is an alternate world, maybe, a different dimension in which Wormel could have responded to this Instead, he's not responding to it going to lose this base No, no, no, I know what's going to happen He's going to aim or he's going to move command here And then he's going to walk into the Vikings No, he's actually, this is also not good, because you need these units Okay, he's actually moving back Nice. Hey, it doesn't have blink I mean, yeah, we're only 30 minutes in the game I mean, that's not completely surprising, I guess He's not even microing this too poor It's just the stalkers really would have helped there Marks in six more, slow warping pilot This army is just relaxing for a bit He's going to recall half of his army again He's going to recall half of his army again Isn't he? Oh my god, he lost 35k this game already He lost 35K At this point, I'm not even sure if he can still win this fight Not especially like this Hello, can we get the stalkers on the Vikings? Storm hasn't been cast yet, the second storm This is not it. The Tempice need to clear the battle cruisers because they do extra damage to battle cruisers because they're massive air Yeah, he just lost What a stupid game What a stupid game What a annoying way to lose I'm not even sure if he lost because of planetaries and mines It felt like he just had terrible fights in the late game I mean, walking into the same planetary and the same mines over and over, definitely didn't help Don't get me wrong, but I feel like the speed at which things were happening was a bigger issue, no? Maybe I'm wrong? No, I don't think I'm wrong actually I think I'm completely on point there. I like that now that he has 40 supply left, he decides that maybe it's okay to start attacking planetaries I probably could have gotten it if he killed the Zelletis or the SEVs as well I mean this game is actually just over now G G I guess Yeah, I guess Is this actually what games look like? Not sure what happened here? Would you mean not sure what happened there? Let me tell you Exactly what happened there, Cringer Uh, Wiram Hall So, first of all, let's take a quick look again at your balance complaint complain Terran's defensive options are outrageously powerful and require no execution to perform at a high level of efficiency. Okay, the defensive options weren't really the problem, were they? They were part of your problem, but I think a bigger problem that you had here was that you kind of executed like a tower defense AI walking into mazes and then you just optimized where it he put his freaking towers to shoot as long as possible and you just you follow the script completely like there was nothing you did to try and change the script which is a mistake let's actually let's have a little list all right as always we're going to judge you on three different things and if the average of those things comes out as you suck then you suck first of all build order execution. Okay, build order execution wasn't bad The first three and a half minutes were pretty much perfect You didn't block the command center, but I can forgive you for that That's not really part of the build order You knew when to Kronobo boost, I think you forgot one Krono boost Your first warping was a little late, but you did that fine The problem with your build order is that the game continues on after the first three and a half minutes After three and a half minutes, you stop warping in, you just stop doing things altogether It's like your little brother that is like two and a half years old took over from that point on The first three minutes, beautiful, almost perfect, great. And then the next, the 10 minutes after, it's like you just stopped doing things You had a Stargate ready that didn't do anything Your war pins on the other side are extremely late Your build order gets a small suck because you did, you know, you did do well So small suck, still a suck, but very close to being neutral Second, your unit control Your unit control, unironically, is some of the worst that I've seen in my life And I know I say that, oh, this unit control is awful, a lot But I don't think I've seen anyone actually with worse unit control than this It is because you're actively looking for ways to kill your units. Like, whereas most people, they just don't control their units well, or they move command a bunch, you just keep walking into your opponent's range of the planetary or into the same mines for a seventh time It's a bit like if you play against the easy AI and he doesn't have detection He just keeps walking back and forth It really is uncanny I don't think I've seen this before It's really either a lack of object permanence or, well, I don't actually Actually, no, you can put your theories in the comments, whatever you have For your unit control, I'm giving you a massive suck That is above a big suck, and is the biggest type of suck that you can receive in this show Congratulations. Number three, your game plan It is very difficult to judge something that isn't there So, I would say your game plan was awful, but In order to criticize a game plan, I would need to see something I will fill you on this I'm not going to say, you sucked I will fill you because I didn't receive anything Sometimes for school you need to send in a paper, and then the teacher didn't receive it in their email by 12 You just get a fill You don't get a grade You don't get a grade on this It just wasn't there So you had a lack of a plan That was a fail You had a massive suck on unit control. and on build order, yet a small suck Put all of these together and you, my friend, suck Congratulations Welcome to the team If you like this episode of Is It Inba or Do I Suck?

        "description": "My dear friend souL - one of the top european players - recently reached out to me, saying that TvP just cannot be right the way it is and that early Probe damage just does not matter. Am I really playing an overpowered and disgusting IMBA race? Or can someone of his caliber suck as well?",
        "video_id": "Zf2AmGrwg-8",
        "text": "Dear Harstam, I would like to know why my opponent can still easily aim of me even after losing 22 workers to few hellions If I can't win after such damage, what will happen if my opponent wouldn't have micro like my grandma and lose 6 to 7 workers instead of 22? Signed, Sol Yes Saul, the top 10 European player, second best player in Poland and one of the most infamous Terunwiner's in all of Europe, rank 30, 31 in the world ranking, put there by Alleghen, not my rankings So definitely one of the top players sent me a replay where he killed 22 workers with a few Helions, probably four, and he couldn't win after giving that amount of damage to his opponent. And he asked, well, how can I win if I can't even win after killing 22? How many do I need to kill, you know? That's a good question, Sol Let's have a look at this replay and decide whether It is Himba or if you suck All right Top right we have Sol, the Terran player for Cascade It always feels like I'm about to cast this game because it's such high level players And bottom left, we have Christiana Also a Polish player, but this is a Protos player Also one of the better European prox players, I have to admit. Very solid player that likes to be slightly overly aggressive and used to be a little little bit known for bad mannering a little bit, but not much anymore these days He's grown up He's now a powerful man rather than just a boy And he's a very solid protist player Now, the beauty of watching pro games is that I don't have to worry too much about the early game builder, right? The first three minutes, at least the first five minutes, should be pretty clean We're playing the absolute highest level These guys know when to build their first barracks, when to build their first refinery, how their Reaper is supposed to move, etc, etc So I'm not at all worried about this. What I can't tell you that I'm a little bit worried about is that Saul tends to be slightly greedy So I'm afraid that he's going to be doing some major damage, be slightly too greedy behind it and then take too much damage behind it to kind of undo that damage Often people kill a lot of workers with their initial attack, but by doing their attack, they're putting themselves behind in some way because they need to invest so much in defense afterwards For example, with Taryn, what can happen is if you open with a helion drop or you open with four helions, it delays any follow-up factory units. If your opponent plays Stargate and gets like Phoenixes or a couple of oracles, you need to get two, three cyclones and a couple of Vikings, and this can delay your barracks by a lot So this means that your opponent has a lot of time to basically get back in the game by chrono-boosting their economy or just investing a lot in the economy Zer could make a lot of drones, et cetera, et cetera Ooh, this is nice This is a cute little first move So Saul here sees, hey, my opponent is playing Nexus before a core, which means that there isn't going to be a quick adept It also means that this bunker will largely go unspotted. And even if it gets spotted at this point, Christianer can't do anything about it because this Adept is simply going to be too late. So Christianer sees the bunker. He's like, oh, crap, this sucks. It's immediately going to throw down a Shield Battery here and starts a Stargate as well at the same time. So this Adept is going to pop out. You see, you see, Christianer is just actually trying to kind of It's trying to zone this in some way. Almost got it, but not quite. This Shield Battery is going to be good, but it's not going to be good enough, I think. I think you're going to need a second Shield Battery here. Or you're going to need to get two stalkers behind this. With just a single stalker, I don't think you're quite going to cut it We'll see if he decides to get a second stalker or what he decides to do So far it doesn't really seem like he's getting a second stalker Just looks like he's going to be going straight into an oracle Might be a little painful Could be looking at maybe a super battery here though, that might be good enough If he chronoboose this oracle, I'd be very surprised This is definitely a super battery territory I'm surprised how well he's doing I don't think the SEV repair has been doing too great Now behind this, what do we see Sol do? He's getting heliants, he's getting a proxy star port. So indeed it is going to be a proxy star port and he's also getting a tech lab here So all of this is looking pretty good So actually is a fair amount slower than Christiana Christiani is very rapid It's very weird You don't need to click this much, especially not in the early game, but whatever Let's have a quick look at what the soul is doing He sells the bunker Oh, gets salvaged He gets four aliens I wouldn't have minded if he had checked what his opponent is really doing I guess he already saw the Oracle at this point It doesn't matter too much Christiana moves across the map with the Oracle Actually nothing here at home to defend Look at this. It's actually really sad Ooh, Cristiano is getting distracted by this Reaper If he wouldn't have gotten distracted by this Reaper and just straight up went in, I think he would have been able to kill six, seven workers here immediately That's not the case I think Saul is a little bit down in workers for whatever reason It's actually moving into a major supply block, double depots Christiana could just move in here, but he wants to go home It doesn't quite know what's happening Has a third base on the way It is all of us, well, actually triple gate, but triple gate after the third base Here come the Hellions, no vision of it So this is gonna do a lot of damage. I guess this is going to be like, what, 16, 17 workers, and maybe you get five workers later on with like a mine drop Meanwhile at home, we saw Seoul, by the way, have to build three depots at the same time because he was so massively supplied what Gonna get a lot of workers here This is actually, this is 100% game over, by the way Well, 100% game over This is very likely to be game owner So he loses all of his halions, which is annoying, not the end of the world, gets his starport back home, and he immediately starts his cyclone Now, I saw something happening here, which is not great, okay? Especially not at this level. And I'll explain you what it is exactly So the most important thing for Taryn, literally one of the most important things in the world, is to get Stim and Combat Shield very fast, Okay This is extremely important There's nothing more important because as long as Protols is aware that you're not getting stim and combat shield, they can keep producing probes and they can delay their extra infrastructure Now, these are some rather high level concept So the longer you see that the barracks are being delayed, the longer you can delay your own infrastructure and focus on things like tech, getting gases and more workers. The moment you know you need to have a influx of units is when you want, your own infrastructure to finish, or gates four to eight, basically This is a very special timing for the ProDos, and at the very high level, this is one of the most important things, is being aware of when that timing of that gate influx needs to hit exactly And that's why it is so extremely important for Terran to either, well, in this case, if you don't actually get a starboard at home, I think the best thing is to almost always just go into three racks from here And get your barracks as fast. as fast as possible so you can get that unit production up and you can be aggressive quickly again after such a push While Saul is microing this, he is not producing anything at home Now for a platinum player, for a gold player, for a diamond or even for a master's player, I can't forgive this, but if you have the speed and if you are as good as Saul is, you need to be capable of macroing He right now is floating 500, 600 minerals He's queuing up, look at this He's queuing up three SEVs per CC So that's another 100 He's basically floating 800 minerals and 300 gas at four minutes and 46 seconds in the game It's about 1,100 resources that he's floating. He's not producing from the barracks At the moment, he's not producing from this factory either So he's being very inefficient with his resources, either for future defense against Phoenixes and Or or he could be cutting these units or cutting some extra of these to get faster barracks to get a faster command center So he's just being lazy, queuing up a lot of SCVs and not building anything These extra barracks and these CCs, let's actually see when they could have possibly gone down So if he wanted to get a fast extra CC, he couldn't have built it at this point yet, right? We're seeing that that's actually not possible It could have canceled these two workers or at least one of them. It's not possible If he had wanted a barracks, that probably would have been possible at this point His barracks could have gone down at 420 Then we continue on This also is where the double supply block was, by the way So that's also a little bit painful Well, the triple supply blocks So that's another hundred minerals kind of wasted He didn't need this depot yet At this point, he could have already added the command center, and probably, if you minus the depot and cancel at least one of the SUVs, probably would have been able to get a command center and a barrack at this point That's 4 30 Then we continue on. We already saw what happened on the other side of the map Continues Bladdy, blah, blah, blah Still killing workers You're doing a good job there That's not what I'm blaming him for He is about 30 seconds late with his stim timing, with his command center timing Now, if you get your command center 30 seconds later, that also means you're sacrificing about two and a half workers, as every single SUV takes 12 seconds to build If you delay this, that basically costs you two workers Okay? So that's already two workers that you should have been further ahead that you're not, if you would have built it at 5 30 The stim is delayed by about 30 seconds as well. And I understand that for a lot of you guys watching this, this is going to sound like I'm nitpicking, and I am, but this is the highest level Things like this are important You can't just be queuing up three SEVs at the same time This isn't master's, anymore, a low grandmaster where you can get away with this type of stuff This is the high level, baby Details matter Commencer goes down to late Barracks go down to late He did a fantastic job with the Hellions He micro those well He did a good job there Sends the Starport back in time Gets double eBay A little bit debatable whether that is completely necessary I'm not sure. It seems like he went double eBay because he was floating money and I was like, oh crap, I need to spend it on something Because right now he is having trouble spending his money Because he basically has too much saturation for the amount of infrastructure that he has So it's going to be floating a bit And that's an issue And then the double eBay, they work out nicely So follows up with a couple of cyclones I'm not even sure It's not the biggest thing But I think he could have probably swapped at least one of the barracks for this factory. and I'm also not entirely sure on siege tanks but I understand why you would want siege tanks maybe I don't even mind this as much it's a different perhaps a difference of opinion that he wants siege tanks here I probably would have said hey I think you're going to be able to survive against your opponent that you've scouted with late tech like you're going to be fine going straight into mines here but tanks it also isn't too bad you're going to have to be relatively defensive with that though now another thing I'd like to you guys to all pay attention to is the fact that while this is happening, is that the worker production isn't perfect. So right now, we're missing five, six seconds on this CC, we're missing like, what, eight, nine seconds on this CC We're actually missing a fair amount of SEV production on these bases And usually this wouldn't be a massive issue, except that he's rushing out a fast third CC So he actually is going to need those extra workers Christianer, on the other hand, sees the late timing of these barracks and says, hey, rather than having to spend all my chronobo boost in Twilight and Forge, I can spend all my chronobust on my workers, and he already had a third base. So right now, he's allowed to use all of his chronobo boost on Nexai rather than on a fast charge, rather than having to the chronobo boost to charge two times, or three times to get 30 seconds faster Because this barracks was delayed by 30 seconds, your charge can be delayed by 30 seconds And 30 seconds is exactly three chronobo boost So that is still three extra chrono boost that Christianer gets to put on the Nexus for free because Saul played poorly there Combined it with the two SEVs of the command center being too late and you're already seeing how it's possible that Christianer is getting back into this game On top of that, Sol not continuously producing SUVs Very painful as well. Once again No workers being produced here whatsoever rushing out a fourth and fifth barracks, you could say well it's a decision to cut workers at this point Sure But if you're the position is to cut workers and to attack your opponent, you can't be surprised that your opponent is surpassing you in the worker count You're just all-inning at that point from an earlier advantage And at this point, even though not much has happened, Christiana kind of is okayish economically He's in a bad, he's not in a great spot tech-wise Basically, everything is kind of late from his plus one, his charge. He has good phoenix numbers I'll give him that but his army also looks like massive crap so I still think soul is in a pretty decent lead at this point like I like his position overall it's going to be going into reactor so he built what he built a tank and one of the most important things with terran is to get mines out as fast as possible especially against these heavy phoenix compositions You want to get a lot of mines out So we're going to be paying some attention to what the factory is doing Right now it's not producing any mines. Because if you're playing against this type of army, both zealots and phoenixes are extremely weak, extremely weak against mines because of how the splash works So it's important that these start as quickly as possible Now, he does start them relatively fast I kind of like that out of him That moves back with his tank here moves around and probably starts thinking about attacking Now, the funny thing here is, is that at the same time that Saul wants to attack, look at this, he scans for a fort base, sees the lack of a fort base, keep this in mind, sees the lack of fort base, and then decides to attack His opponent is actually aligning into him right now. Worse upgrades, no due future, four gas, Phoenix, charge lot Okay This is an extremely heavy pressure build There's no splash on the way There's no kind of follow-up plan The only type of splash that Sol really had is being picked off as well We'll see if these mines ever make it through the army And here we have another scan So this is a second scan Soul making sure Scans the lack of a gas at a third base Seas A Zealous being warped in Okay? So right now he's not only aware that there's no for a base, but he's also aware that his opponent is on most likely Phoenix charge lot. So right now he knows his opponent has worse saturation or equal saturation to him, has worse upgrades because he can see, hey, he can click on this and see, hey, plus one isn't even done yet Right now Saul sees zero zero upgrades, sees there's no splash in his opponent's army, his opponent is practically all in, and what does Saul decide to do? Keep going on the rocks, rather than taking a defensive position at the third, starting to make use perhaps of the fact that he has two e-base, get an armory going, and maybe not get supply blocked for a third time this game. Saul instead just keeps going with an army without any splash against an army that does great if there's no splash around. Two mines in the back? Saul right now sees these zealots, scans one more time, looks at this army, and thinks to himself Yeah I think this is possible 22 zealots against 20 Marines 10 marauders and two unburrowed mines and three cyclones cyclones practically useless There's also eight phoenixes here and an oracle If you look at these two armies As a Terran and without having burrowed mines and you think you can fight this You're missing the plot I don't know at what part of your Terran education you fell asleep during class but you gotta go back you know back to school because this isn't it look at this you're just absolutely getting destroyed this obviously wasn't going to be a very close fight look he even had like half what was this like 15 supply was just standing at home chilling at home and I don't mind 15 supply being at home but you need to be able to look at this fight and realize that this is going to go poorly I mean, literally half of his army could get picked up by phoenixes, and then there's 20 zealots on the ground. Yeah, of course the zealots are going to win That's kind of what happens Then right now, Saul's like, oh, crap, I'm going to need more mines, we're going to need more units, start sending things down Still not in an awful position It's not a great position right now His third is under attack His opponent has a lot of momentum Mines not burrowed yet. both of them once again get lived so once again the one unit that can really change these fights again is not participating so far I think we've seen like a single mine shot finally we have an armory on the way so moving way too far away this I don't quite understand why he scans if he's not going to do anything with the information look at this he scans wait what let me look at this again so we have this okay we have this move out he he nice goes back home with everything He writes, okay, I'm being under attack and I can't right now defend my third base Then what the soul do? He scans Okay, look at what he sees. He sees eight zealots move in Look at his army Looks at the zealots Looks at his army and thinks, oh, seems okay This is like buying radar technology for 50 million and then having a blind guy man it It's like, there's no point He keeps you scanning things It's like this beautiful technology on the orbital called this, what actually? He's called the sweeper scan or something like that He uses it He sees a lack of a fort base He uses it He's a lack of a gas here Normal probe saturation He's eight zealids warped in Uses it here She's his entire opponent army Use it here And what is his response here? I think I could change these phoenixes. He's like, no, you can't You have like three Marines Of course you're going to die in Now these SUVs are also vulnerable once again Like finally these mines are actually settling down Do you want to be building a mine count at this point? You know, you want to be adding on to that area This, luckily for him, actually goes semi well in that he can, for now at least hold this area, but he lost way too many units for free Yeah, once again, he's going to lose SUVs here Now he's forced to push forward because he doesn't want to lose these SUVs I understand this move out I didn't understand the one before. He should have kept these SCVs at home, floated the CC for a little bit His opponent still is on three bases and on a very mediocre worker count, and on very mediocre tech It's still completely possible Armory isn't done yet Once again, these mines, yeah One of them gets a burrow in But he's not building a mine count because their armory is also relatively late So these mines don't become invisible Now you're down 14 workers You're playing against a guy who almost has a fourth base You don't have any SCVs left Your entire tech advantage has disappeared You don't have a ghost academy because, well, you can't afford it You don't have any extra upgrades on the way. You're still getting a Ghost Academy because at this point, at this point, there is no such thing as a good decision anymore Everything is a bad decision So I could flame him for getting the Ghost Academy, but I could also flame him for getting plus two Whoa, you need to finish the game So I can't even blame him for this It's like he's down 30 supply It just doesn't look great He needs to do something But it's in the past five minutes where almost every single move that he made was a mistake He had full information He had full control. he just didn't macro that great and then he'd another scan now he scans this like well still not fort base scanning over here or scouting over here with the other mine and I like this this is good play this is genuinely good play okay he's figuring out okay what is my position what can I still do and this mine drop is brilliant because it forces your opponent back gives you some breathing room as a terran the only problem is once again it's not actually building your mine count at home This is really good, by the way What he's doing here is absolutely fantastic I wouldn't mind if one of them stays burrowed. I just want to highlight this because it is really high-level play, and these guys are very good Here, rather than shooting immediately, you see Christianer is just throwing one probe forward He just keeps them unburrowed, and he just wants to burrow on burrow forever, basically And right now, Sol sees his opponent's army here At that point, I think you can burrow these I would probably even just walk one towards the third base, if you see the entire army here, and then you have to lift this and just run back because your opponent is basically, like you can't fight this army, I think, without mines at home Saul's still trying, which I find impressive. He's making some very good plays right now, and I'm not even going to, you know, flame him for that It's just good It's actually just good place Yeah I wouldn't have minded if he would have split it one more time So one here, one here, one here Against a player that doesn't have detection, it could be good I don't understand this move out at all I really don't He just doesn't have the units It's so obvious that you Without the mine count, you just can't fight this type of army Like, you need mines and good EMPs, and then I think you can do it But I think with just one of the two, to me it's obvious that this shouldn't really work. There's just too many phoenixes You need something that deters the phoenixes from just running in I don't think any of these mines shot either And yeah, at this point, phoenixes fly in, pick up everything Mines here didn't get microed now I'm going to be a little bit critical This is a static freaking unit You can move it back It can't shoot you back here You're forcing your opponent to warp in extra in that case Same with this You can move it over here You can move it to the natural Like there's a lot of things you can do I'm not going to make excuses for that. Maybe it was a little bit rough with this, but I think this also, he shouldn't have been moving out over here I also think that was a mistake I understand that he wanted to do that because, like, hey, I have a timing maybe with ghost, but not with this little minds I still think he actually had a possibility Same time he is floating 900 for whatever reason, even though he's only mining with 55 workers I'm not quite sure how that happens, but I'm not even going to be too upset about that I mean, that's okay It's live You know, sometimes in this type of hectic game, you make that type of macro mistake That's fine I can at least understand that. His opponent also isn't perfect And his third base gets on He lifts it It's like, hey, I don't think I can hold it Then fly back Scans I wouldn't mind if he just leaves at this point But so far, Saul has been terrible interpreting any information he has gotten through scans So maybe he thinks he can only see things with the scan on the Mimap He's not aware He can also just look at it with his actual view But, yeah, I don't know It's hard to say It makes me sad because he genuinely played well at a lot of times during this game You know? I really do think he played well at certain times. And I think Christiana also made some mistakes, you know I'm not sure though, guys I need to think about this And yeah, Christiano just moves in and, yeah, I mean, at this point, still has a pretty big army Yeah, problem is just there's a colossite transition and so just, yeah, it doesn't have anything really Like he has decent army supply, but the army is, is god awful And at this, at this point, the mines are becoming a little worse because Colossi are on the way, right? So, yeah Like, once Colossi are, I pop out against something like this, the mines and the marines become so much less valuable The colossi is basically a hard note to mines. It's like the don't do drugs, except instead of your random city cop coming to tell you that at your high school It's like a guy that comes to your house every night and he shoots you if you smoke to eat that day And that's what the colossi is to the marine Gigi and Christiana wins Yeah, this is, okay, this is a genuinely hard one And once again, I do want to give the context that right now I'm judging through the lens of watching one of the best players in the world This is not your average Joe This is supposed to be one of the top players And he did a lot of things very, very well His build order was super tight. His initial reactions to the Nexus, his micro with the Reaper and the SEV His helion control was extremely good First four and a half minutes were practically perfect Game decision wise, control wise, macro wise this was good Then we hit 425, 430 in the game, and he starts to slip Overbuilding SCVs, meaning that you basically are faking that you're not floating It's like 200 minerals in command centers at all times You're not continuously producing Marines, which could have been afforded if you wouldn't have been overbuilding SUVs He's delaying not only his command center, but also his extra barracks He is, he just stops building SUVs for whatever reason, talking about Seoul and delaying his stim and combat shield because his barracks are laid. I think these are the main points Then he scans four times Sees a lot with those scans Gets a lot of information Not necessarily sees things directly, but indirectly Can deduce a lot from the clues that he's getting He doesn't do that Straight up scans his opponent's army Straight up scans the warpins And still decides to take awful fight after awful fight after awful fight, not realizing when to give up his third base Huge error. as a terran you should know that sometimes in life there are times where you temporarily have to give up your third phase to later take it back and mule it again then in the end with the mine drop i think if he splits the mines one one rather than two one and just holds his own ramp rather than moving out i still think he can get a push set up with six seven mines before colossi where he can get a very nice army supply and he's also going to have four to five ghosts I think at times it can feel very frustrating when you're getting A-moved by Zellets. It can feel that if you do a lot of damage in the early-in, it can feel unfair if your opponent can just chrono-boost up all those workers But you gave him this time, you gave him the three extra chronobo-boos, because he didn't need the chronobo-boost charge, because your barracks were laid You then stopped building workers So, yeah, he pulled ahead in workers again And then he took terrible fight after terrible fight, not understanding what position you had in the game. I'd love to say that Protus is in balance and I'm sorry and ashamed for playing this race but today is not that they soul you suck but not that hard just at small things you're actually kind of good but you did suck sorry all right that's going to be it for this episode of is it imba or do I suck if you did enjoy this episode don't forget subscribe to the YouTube channel If you hated this episode, be sure to also subscribe to the YouTube channel Hit the like button.

        "text": "Dear Harstam, Proto's Zimba In this game I went up to five bases while he was stuck on two I made ghosts which are supposed to counter Protos I made widow mines which deal bonus splash against shields, and I made Vikings to counter his capital ships I realized that my engineering base were way too late, but this error should not let Tos win Please tell me how I can beat Protos Tanks smash Mallow, also known as Prime He made widow mines which deals bonus splash damage against shield, and he made Vikings to counter his capital ships Also, ghost, which are supposed to counter protos This is a mistake that people often make Let me just state this first. It's that they state these things without any context They say, widow minds deal bonus splash damage to shields I mean, this is true, but just because that's the case, doesn't necessarily mean that widow mines are always good Storm deals a lot of AOE damage on the target area That's not an argument for you playing well That is just what the spell does Ghosts are supposed to counter protos? What are you on about? If you're playing mass ghost against someone building 30 disruptors, it's not that good If you have mass ghost against someone building mass Templar or mass Arcon, yeah it becomes a lot better It's a bit like saying tomatoes are delicious, which is true. But if you put the tomato and chocolate together, all of a sudden you'd say, well, there are things that go better together with chocolate than tomato, like more chocolate or strawberries in chocolate, like a chocolate fountain A good analogy Let's just start with this game, though As we have, we're already two minutes in, I accidentally forgot the pause while I was reading the imbalance form, but that's okay, because Prime had a perfect start, I think Look at that Yeah, it's not bad Reaper, Marine Depot, CCC at a normal time Look at that ProDos on the other hand, also looking, well, in my opinion, pretty okay I'm happy with this I'm completely fine with this opener Is the speed too low? I think so. This looks very slow I'm sorry for that Some people were like, man, this is the speed. of the video slow and it's hard to guys a bit slow on the head but now the game also seems to slow down but no that was indeed true two gateways from the protlos guess i said it is not a build order out of the protos by the way so so far i'm liking what the terran is doing a lot more except for the fact that he's floating 400 and that his second gas is a little bit late it doesn't get a bunker either which does carry some risk with it but um it is oxide so very often you can kind of defend the ramp and you don't need a bunker quite as much Okay, Reaper jumps in once again and I mean basically saw everything he needed to see, right? So two gateways, saw a third pilot and he can now say to himself, this guy has no clue what he's doing. And I think that's enough for now Even scouts in and sees the quick forge, like if I was prime here, I'd be very confused and B I'd be very happy because I'd be pretty sure that my opponent doesn't really have a build order that makes a lot of sense Meanwhile prime, equal workers are almost equal in workers so just in an overall good spot okay swaps these two goes two hundred years okay this is just not a very good build um from barracks first into reaper this just hits really late like these cars what's that oh these cars are going to be done like about a a minute later than they usually are. Usually you can finish cars if you open like Marine first barracks first you can finish them around like 303 304 or something like that So now they're like a solid minute late Technically actually let me pass here If you want to you could hit in your opponent's main base with four Hallions with a Proxied Starport at 355 So at the point where my man Prime gets his two cars you could be hitting with a drop Now, in that case, you do need to skip Reaper or need to open gas first, but just for a point of reference, basically, for how late these scars are and how bad this opener is. Like, the buildings were built at an okay time, but then the things he did build the buildings make very little sense to me But, I mean, I don't want to be too critical either It is still an early game The Proloss also isn't really playing a builder that makes a lot of sense to me It's getting a Stargate, plus one air weapons immediately Yeah, I'm not quite sure what this is exactly We've got four cars Yeah, four cars Okay, assimilator I'm just kind of wondering what's happening in this game He keeps building more cars, but I see he's researching Stim He has five cars. now and okay i just don't understand this he's getting benches right so he knows he's never going to drop into the base like he's not planning on getting a medevac he scouts up the ramp sees that there's a battery there and a bunch of stalkers and says to himself i can't run up with four hellions right now and then his response is to get more heliens with which he can't run up with Helions are awful in armies You want to stop building Helions as fast as possible They're only good for harassment in this matchup Exclusively Unless you play Mac, then you want them in your army But it's not playing Mac So right now he built seven Helions and killed one worker. And I think he even killed that with the Reaper. I wouldn't be surprised if he killed. Now he goes in. So he runs by. Lose four Hellions. Realizes there's a cannon in the natural mineral line and flies his Banshee straight into the cannon. Now these are the types of moves that really do surprise me. And I kind of just want to go over this sequence again because this is just fabulous. So I just want to, I think sometimes it's important to do the first person here. So he goes in, he sees this cannon, okay, he kills half a Probe. As he sees this happening, he sends in the Banshee, where does he click it? He doesn't click it on the cannon. He clicks it right in range of the cannon, though And then he starts looking at, no, he moves it forward This is, I just don't understand that Like I can understand if you're having trouble like using units or if you're not that fast, like your mechanics can be bad But this just makes no sense It doesn't This is like if you have a door that isn't opening with the key you currently have and you stick in the key, you try to turn it around, it doesn't work, you take it out, then you walk away for five seconds, you turn around, and you go again with the same key It's like, it doesn't work like that It really just doesn't work like that. I don't understand why he thinks it does Again, both players are floating a nice amount can see that they're definitely not Americans because they're actually saving some money It's a European game We have a nice little depot wall as well in the natural What is this? I'm loving this setup I don't know what this is, but we have like half a marauder being built You have Stim Wait, Stim is already done, I guess Yeah, Stim is done Combat Shield, Cloak Finally have these Like, only Tech Labs as well He's only going to pump out marauders And he's getting a straight Ghost Academy and a command center He has the weirdest army composition I've seen in my life. Like this actually, I've seen a lot of games for IOTIS I've seen a lot of games where I'm like, I don't understand this, but this I really don't understand He has four marines with Stim, he has a Benchie with cloak, he has three widow mice, two cars and two marauders And the medevacs are about the bull This is great This is absolutely fantastic I really do believe that the way that Prime kind of approaches the game is where he has certain rules in his head, not based on situations he meets, but just general rules like cloak banshees are good, mines are good, marines are good, marauders are good And they're all specific, you know. He once saw maybe clam kill 22 workers with banshees, And ever since then, every single game Prime played, he just opened with banshees, a couple of banshees Then he also has a game where he saw Maitaren do a lot of damage with mines And it's like, okay, let me add some mines He saw Helion drops go well And he heard a professional player or a caster say that ghosts are good against ProDos And he was like, all right, ghost every single game as fast as possible from only Tech Labs No, wait. He's getting triple reactor now? Wait, what is this barracks count? one two three four five six seven now here is something where I could make fun of him for but I won't and let me pause here okay just for a second so ideally on three base you're on five racks one starboard one factory and then you can decide to add a second starport if you're once your gas is finished you have enough the resources for that prime is using more production facilities He has seven barracks He's getting a second star port He's getting a fort base, which is good And he also has a factory So he's two barracks too many Now I could say, what an idiot He can't macro. But no, I actually really respect this He says to himself, hey, I know my macro isn't perfect I know I tend to float a little bit And rather than floating and have money in the bank that I'm not using, if I just add two extra barracks, I make it a little bit easier for myself It was, it will just happen So I actually, I actually really appreciate that I really do I think that is a good call. What happened here? Even that it shoots? Did I miss something? What are they talking about? Are they? What is he talking about? Are they watching a different game? Is the chat not lined up with what's happening in the game? The animation started? So, I just have no clue what these guys are wrong about I just don't understand it Oh, here it comes I think they're talking about the Widow Mine though, because the Widow Mind tends to shoot after it dies already, once the animation started And I guess that's what the animation means Look at them ghost Okay This fight, this once again, an interesting. army but you think he's gonna stim oh my god does he have EMP on rapid fire just EMP that are like four times I love that though that's good also stim so he's using hotkeys now I think he's aware that there's a third base here is this Liberator sieged up yeah it's it's difficult to see though but you see the the white lines here and over here okay now I moves forward EMP, right click the super battery, right click this, he keeps EMPing Look at it! Click the super battery, right click it A super battery use 1400 shields over a period of 14 seconds, I believe Instead he decided to let it live and keep EMPing the units. rather than just killing the super battery and winning the game Then he tanks his own mine shot Why does he keep waiting every time for his opponent to get more units? I mean, the game is still completely over here There's like legitimately a single carrier and three zealots I don't actually understand how it's possible to lose this one 71 army supply against 22 This thing's going to I love that these Liberators just chilling in the back. are chilling in the back yeah okay there we go moves everything forward I feel like oh that's a good EMP that was a sick EMP okay he just wins the game now and he's flowing 3k resources right now so is his opponent though and he keeps building the liberators maybe he doesn't know that liberators aren't actually good against carriers they're okay if you attack the interceptors because you have a little bit of splash but I'm I'd always prefer Vikings in this scenario Didn't he also say that he went Vikings? In his imbalance room, I think he did Hamster will put that on the screen right now I think he did Or hamster will call me an idiot One of the two. Hamster much prefers doing the second thing, but I think I'm correct here Why does he keep rallying forward? In small numbers Like, this army, if he just maxes out or just does anything his opponent has 40 workers right now the terran is actually doubling the income like in everything double the minerals double the gas another orbital i really like that he's getting so many orbitals by the way this is really smart because if you're fighting in someone with eratos they're never going to move across the map and if they do it's going to be with air so a planetary isn't even useful i do like this this is a good play getting a lot of workers though i think slightly too many workers. Like the main focus here should be on getting more units out This one Barracks doesn't have a tech lab yet and I don't think is, he's just not producing things You know how a lot of people always say that, oh now it happened with the mine A lot of people always say that until you hit like diamond or masters or whatever, all you need to do is focus on macro I feel like this guy has gotten the reverse advice It's like one of his friends It's like one of his for like an April Fool's jokes, told him that in order to improve, all you really need to do is micro-what Holy crap I just want to Maybe he's afraid of the battery. Maybe he doesn't understand how the battery works But just look at this interaction here, okay? So he owns this cannon. Then starts attacking the battery, sees the super battery go on, and it's like, hey, that will heal everything else except itself let me just attack every other unit that isn't the battery right now even did some damage to this pylon for good measure so it's not like he's opposed to the idea of attacking buildings he's just opposed to the idea of attacking that specific building still floating three he's getting so much money per minute imagine what he could do with that money the amount of of units of pure marines he could throw in there or barracks or turrets like he could walk across the map with 40 SUVs and build 30 turrets over here okay and I think that would be a winning move I unironically would think that could be a winning move I don't think it's a good move but it'd be better than what he's doing now which is producing from two structures at a time I don't know why I did that yes two star ports does he have any upgrades actually He said that his e-base were late, but that shouldn't be the reason why he lost. I don't think him having late e-base is the reasons why he lost either Perhaps it's because he only gets liberators rather than Metafax And mass ghosts rather than Marines Even though I don't even mind ghosts too much here Just not this many, I think Twelve ghosts really pushing it You can also produce Marines way faster And really, the only thing we should care about right now is producing a creptonal unit Okay We're maxed Well, 101 workers though Army supply is actually really close Yeah, this might actually be an issue Didn't he also say that it was five base against two? Where is the two base? This guy's been on three base the entire game Holy crap. I actually think he has EMP on Rapid Fire He just EMPs the same spot again and again and again and again and again and again Now he loses his meta back and he's like, oh crap, that sucks Let me just wait until the guy has more interceptors again, then I can once again throw away half my army into it He just keeps building workers 105 How many do we get, you think? Okay, pause Did did it, did it, did it did it did it Midgame quiz time. Are we going to get less than 110 workers? Are we going to get a worker count between 110 and 115? Or are we going to get more than 115 workers? We'll come back to this later once his workers start dying or once he stops worker production Right now we're at 109 I feel like that this guy really works in production cycles of everything together So whenever he just goes, he looks back at his base and just every structure he sees in his main vision or in his peripheral vision he just starts producing from like a mindless builder Okay. rotation rotation sees the cannons okay emps in peace in peace in peace no in peace stim no matter of x everything in one control group check okay so right now he knows what this opponent has army wise moves forward stims in peace this is good this actually this was by far the best fight he's had so far he stymped he empeed there was no super battery, he absolutely destroyed this fight Holy crap, this was a good fight And this was even a fight without Metafax If this fight was with Metafax, it would have been perfect He probably would have straight up won the game here Now all he needs to do is produce units. Produce a lot of units, a lot of Metafax, a lot of Vikings, and what you do is you just wait for a little bit over here You give up one or two bases, 109 workers, by the way I don't think we're going to get above 110. And the one thing that you don't want to do, is just rally your units into your opponent as they come out you need like two cycles this is a tiny army they actually a miniscule army you need to be producing from everything as well like every single building needs to be pumping out units right now and ideally marines marines ghost viking medevac it's all we care about 5k in the bank 160 supply okay no no no no okay this is this is what i was talking about this is the most important oh actually might hold it no he won't the most important thing to do is to just get a bigger army you just dealt a massive blow to your opponent you have insane upgrades you have the sickest eco in the world just max out for the love of god just really just save up your army but i don't think he's gonna do that like oh this is a really important position to defend because what if he starts attacking these rocks that would be terrible let me just move forward a bit. They know your opponent is moving back already Just let him go home This is like if you're playing hide and seek with your friends, you're hidden in a hollow tree and your friend starts walking away from the hollow tree and you just start like throwing rocks at him, hoping that that will somehow help you that he doesn't see you It's like, no, he's already running away, just let him go Like just he just keeps feeding his opponent What are these pylons? I feel like this ProDos doesn't even really want to win the game Hey, it just moves around for fun I was going to kill some refineries maybe If I lose, toss imba No, if you lose, it is because you're an idiot. And you built three Metafax this entire game, five Metafx this entire game, and 17 Liberators, even though you're playing against Airtals But keep believing that Protos is Inba Keep believing Prolis is Inba Oh, here we go My job Poof EMP EMP EMP EMP EMP EMP actually tends to be quite good in almost any situation against Prodels, by the way I think he kind of misunderstood when people said ghosts are good against Proloss it's more of like a support unit It's like when I say Templar are good against Serk. I don't want an army of 35 high Templar, but maybe I should be more specific when I say these type of things because I feel like there's a lot of people that just, they hear a word It's like, yeah, you know, it's good to get an or it's good to get oracles against Urk And you get people like Haas just building 25 oracles going, lull, bz, to be fair, in Haas's case, it actually tends to work But it shouldn't All right, it shouldn't work, guys and that's what's important Yeah, this fight is going to go nowhere, as kind of expected He has no medevacs His army is actually tiny Still has 2 8K in the bank, by the way, not producing anything. These SUVs haven't worked in a long time He's running around, trying to leach of society in different places They were here before Couldn't leach there Now they're leaching here, seeing their brothers work Pathetic Oh, here comes the attack from the back Still potentially could have been okay if he had all of this money in Marines Sadly, all of this money is not in Marines, but it's in Bitcoin instead, which a good investment, but perhaps not as useful if you're under attack, everything being in the blockchain and all I never hear the cryptocurrency fanboys about that, you know. It's nice that all your cash is in the blockchain, but how are you going to fight the carriers? That's one of those things they never have an answer for It's the crypto enthusiast But I'm sure there will be a couple in the comments telling me that actually the blockchain is great against carriers People are just not using it correctly, and will actually save electricity Alright buddy relax This is absolutely getting destroyed I wonder why he's not leaving yet Just running back. Is 14 supply left? This is the type of delusional thinking that you only find in Terrance, you know? He had situations where he was up 90 supply and he couldn't finish the game and right now he's delusional enough to think that while he's on two supply and his opponent is at 195, he can still make a comeback And he isn't just staying in Like, he actually just try to build a marine here Like, he actually really still believes at this point Wow Tos Imba He doesn't sound very genuine sending this to Harsdam Supply I like that the Protot is just very business-like, you know, supply Get out of my game, mate You're dead Yeah Gigi Great I like this. Nice little game by you, Prime Let's just go over it and you know what? We'll do three things again Okay, three things We'll start with your control Then we do your unit composition and then we do your decision making Your control was awful Nice I think there was one fight where you did something correct and that is when you stimped in and you started right-clicking carriers hoping your opponent wouldn't move back Your opponent didn't and it worked out Every other fight was you rapid-firing EMP on the same units, ignoring batteries, making sure that they can knew as much as possible, having liberator sieged in weird locations, having mine seized way in the back where they don't participate. I think you actually just always used F2 or a single control group I am not sure about that I didn't pay too much attention to the rally, but wouldn't surprise me if it was just F2 So for your unit control, you get a major suck Major suck Your composition was awful Terrible, atrocious, painful to watch, it hurt my soul You kept building more and more ghost, even though you probably just needed more damage output from Marines You already have plenty of EMPs You don't need 10 EMPs on the same location and thus you don't need 10 ghosts If the shields are gone, the shields are gone. Spamming more EMP on Protos units that already don't have shields actually don't have shields, actually doesn't do anything most of the time it actually does more to right click the battery but we already did that in the in the one before so i won't i won't go too deep into that you kept building liberators for whatever reason no matter facts two little vikings in general as well yeah you're and too many marauders against an army that had like two templar which your ghost once again already took care of also the mines stop adding mines this long into the game you really don't need them So there we get a minor, minor suck No, no, yeah, minor suck. No, we'll make it major suck as well You also started with the Helium Benchy crap Major suck We changed it again I'm sorry, Hamster It gets very confusing Hamster always, when things change too fast, it doesn't work too well on the head of hamster So you always got to be a bit careful, but major suck hamster, okay? You got it? Final one Your decision making also was absolutely atrocious You went way too high in workers I'm not sure what type of decision that was, is that you wanted 110 workers, rather than just staying on maybe 80 or 75 workers and getting a lot of orbital commands for mules No, instead you went to 109 workers, so actually was answer A, by the way. You kept attacking, even though your opponent clearly had a way bigger army at certain times You kept just rallying in units, hoping that somehow four Marines now would be capable of achieving what your opponent didn't Let's not forget about the Helium Benchy thing, by the way, the Hellion Benchie thing at the start I think that counts as decision-making as well You see the cannon and you go in with the Benchie like that That's a terrible decision You get a major suck there as well You get three major sucks, which means that, my friend, you suck Nice All right That's going to be it for today If you did enjoy it, don't forget to subscribe to the channel.

        "text": "Dear Harstein, I want to complain about Marine, period I meet a T on the ladder He played bio, but don't build any Madafeck or tank From beginning to end, he only produced Marine without Stim Every part of his macro is suck and incorrect But so what? A steady flow of Marine can still combat my army with Bain and Lurke In fact, my scout and Mabvision is also bad But so does he The Terran only have to build many wrecks to produce lots of Marines, and go straight to victory If this is not Imba, please teach me how to against Terran Chinese nickname, I can't pronounce it I don't even know what it says Terran player, platinum league All right, let's hop into this. So the complaint here is that Marines, what was it? They don't require any upgrades They're too easy to control They're extremely broken Just everything about the Marine is, insanity And that is, of course, an issue that needs to be fixed So let's see how this Zirk player does everything in his life Okay? It opens up with a solid 16 hatch The fundamentals are very important in StarCraft too, and I'm glad to see that this ZERC realizes that If there's something wrong in the fundamentals, it's very difficult to build a solid structure on top of that And the 16 hatch is an absolute standard in ZVT and in any matchup, really, 16 hatch very powerful opener, followed by 18 gas 17 pool. So what you do is you rally, yeah, you ready this one to the extractor and this one builds the pool And it lines up extremely well Like this is the most standard build order that every Zerk should know And our Chinese friend does indeed know how to do it in platinum already So that's nice It's a good start, you know It really is important that you get these early things down The opponent is opening with a command center first and has a Tourex opener as well So we see no gases being taken yet. This is a very old school build that got used a lot in Wings of Liberty, especially against Protos, where Terrans would play either CC first or barracks gasless expand and then follow up with three barracks into two gas and then later on get their deck or sometimes only a single gas even after like the second barracks So you have slightly faster, gas, you can get those tech labs a bit faster Very old-school build I don't think this build has ever been very popular against Zirk. And the reason for that is if Taryn doesn't get Helions in the early game, it's way too easy for the Zerk to just continue pumping out drones and to have infinite creep spread because Marines are not great out on the map They're not quick They're not great against links in high numbers They get surrounded easily They're not even great against Queens either until they have common Bad Shield and Stim, probably even need Metafax to help them out So if there's no Helions on the map, the Zerk very often can kind of do whatever it is that they want This is nice as well Immediately starts with the first tumor, the way it's supposed to be. Forgets the larvae inject in the main for a bit But honestly, this opener is very tight Pulled out of gas as well So far, so good All we need right now is an overlord Yep This opener is actually a very solid opener for a platinum player, I believe He said he was 2 8K MMR or something like that So basically 3,000 MMR, so we'll say then I think this is a very good opener Like all of the moves here in the early game are definitely correct You get your second cream tumor, double cream Like, honestly, if I would have been shown this start and like with the macro and everything, I wouldn't have guessed that this is a platinum game at all. Like this is a very solid opener He's getting a lot of drones He's not floating any money whatsoever Speed is on the way Queen count is rising The creep tumors are being used basically the moment they're available or so far they have been Yep, there we go Next creep tumors is going down This is a very, very clean opener here out of the Zerk The one thing that I don't like too much, the fact that the Zerk hasn't scouted anything yet and has right now seen that there's a complete lack of halions. So perhaps sacrificing this overload would be worth or sending in a link to see, hey, what actually is going on on the other side of the map? Now he's going to He's going to figure out what's going on He sees a lot of Marines These are too early for it to be a 2-1-1 So right now he should be thinking Hey, this could be a 3-Rex Before Triple CCC Which is indeed what it is Zirk didn't know this This was a command center first But it's not actually that important right now So let me see this move out as well A little bit of a supply block Which is painful Especially at this moment right You're about to be under attack I think with six queens These Marines don't have stim They don't have combat shield you're going to be completely fine against this. Your queens by themselves should be capable of defending this Actually, built another, I got another supply block immediately, even though he's also building two spines, an evo chamber and a banning nest, just went supply block into supply block into supply block That's one of the reasons right now our Zirk player is falling behind a little bit Queen is getting to choose The micro is good Control is almost correct I think the link should be more in the back here at this point, because you just want the queens to fight There's plenty of transfuses out right now There's two spines as well You don't want to sacrifice links. You probably just want to continue building drones during all of this, which is something that the Zerk has not been doing for whatever reason Once again, going into a supply This is a little bit painful There's no real anticipation on the larvae waves that are coming out, which is actually kind of disappointing It's going to need to transfuse Oh, my God, doesn't transfuse it either. yeah this spine could now re what do you call it move basically take a different position there we go there we position reposition reposition there we go oh my god take a different position reposition that's what i was going for okay plus one the range and carapace so probably going to be going for roaches otherwise this doesn't make much sense you always want your lings and your bains to do as much damage if you're going for a ling bane They could get a bainling nest though It's not actually going to lose this, right? He's actually going to lose this Didn't really reposition the spine That was really bad This was really not necessary as well Just constantly being supply blocked It's so painful. Oh my God Oh, don't do that Just use the queens and dance around the spine Like you can just push where There's still no stim here There's still no combat shield even I have no clue what this terran is doing Oh, he's everything queued up There's five Marines in every barracks right now This almost feels like it's a bot playing Look at this Fort CC on the way already What is this? Two e-base He's playing single gas? No combat shield, no stim I didn't really pay attention to it Okay, I like the bannings, but I don't like the range upgrades. you only go range upgrades for roaches, usually, or you get range upgrades for hydras eventually, but initially in order to get to good hydra or to a lurker counts, you need to get the Malay upgrades initially I'm really surprised the third base hasn't been rebuilt yet, by the way That makes absolutely no sense It's so obvious that it needs to be done Hello What was that? Look at this So outside of my house, there is a bunch of pigeons, okay? And pigeons are legitimately the dumbest animal in the entire world So sometimes when I'm bored, I go outside and I throw stones like just in front of me. I sit at like a little park bench and I just grab some stones and I start throwing them And from everywhere these pigeons will start going and they'll start going on the stones thinking that I'm giving them food while it's just stones And I'll show them looking like this is a stone and I'm going to throw it and then it lands and it still a stone and they'll still all like move towards the stone These banlings are literally dumber than the pigeons Look at this You have the juiciest piece of bread right over here Look at the hit that he could have gotten by just pressing the X button here, just right clicking on these marines. But instead, he goes, what is this? This is the stone that I'm throwing and these are the pigeons While there's a massive loaf of bread or corn or whatever that pigeons, eat Look at this How is this possible? And then he says, oh wait, it's a stone and then he goes over here That's ridiculous It's actually ridiculous Hop Get decent hits in the end Now, you look at that fight and you think to yourself, okay, I had four banlings in my army I had like 20 lynx and five queens My four banlings killed like 30 marines My lynx killed nothing. If you think back of that fight, even if you know nothing about Starcraft, you're going, I want more of those green guys that roll You know, like anyone that plays this game would say that, no matter what level Like, my dad could watch this and go, I don't know what these units do, but they seem freaking strong against the units that the other guys building I want more of those And I'd be like that, you're a legend Completely correct Is there you see more Hydras on the way? A couple of Banelings are being added as well No, there's Baneling speed I lied Baneling speed, that's good Melee upgrades as well being introduced That's good The spore. What is this spore timing? What is this for position? This doesn't He's defending Maybe he's expanding his vision, you know? He doesn't know he can spread overlords So you just put spores on the edge of his creep He's like, oh, that will give me some vision vision Very odd Now, Spine's doing a good job Come to banlings once again Banlings take out a good clump of marines Ling Hydra remains We'll be able to Hello? Can we Hydras are done with this? They did their job We shot twice, guys We can let them go We can let them go He still doesn't have a combat shield, does he? No combat shield? No armory? He's actually just building marines This is an insane game. This is a thing of absolute beauty Huh Okay Mules Long distance mining mules I thought I'd seen it all as a planetary Oh it does have an eBay It makes some sense This is an absolutely magical game so far Combat Shield being researched Nine minutes in game And he gets a factory It's going to get some meta facts Might be for the armory as well as, hey, I want more upgrades It's like, wait, for upgrades, I need an armory For an armory, I need a factory I think that's going to be it I don't think he's going to build Metafax Lurker then Plus one range, plus two range, and carapace. I don't even mind the lurkers, but I kind of think you want to go to a higher eco-on-linked initially, especially if you see all your opponent is doing is pure marine Like, the banlings definitely are a good call There is Macron like a beast-bain way Look at that If you only have to mine minerals, you can get a lot of mineral mining really quick on relatively low work account He has 71 workers and is mining 3 4, 3 5k It's a scan These guys still don't have combat shield Just Okay, look at this fight Look at, oh my This is a nice split This is not a bad split Oh, my marine These hydras don't do anything. I wish there was a unit that could have just exploded on top of these That's better than the hydra More cost efficient than the hydra Less supply than the hydra Lower deer than the hydra Slightly more larva intensive though Is that the issue? No 14 How does he always have 14 larva available? And why is he always floating money? This is, I see this often in lower level Zergs and I just don't understand it. These guys will spend their entire day injecting and spreading creep and then the final step is the easy step you know this is the easiest thing this is like constructing like building a door from scratch like chopping down the tree like the wood and making the handle in it and then the little things on the side that make it swing I don't know what this thing's the cramps metal thing is on the side make sure it stays in you know and then you have this door and all you need to do, the finish is just to close the door And then he goes like, no, it's fine Don't need to close it. It's like, holy crap, all you need to do at this point is just build a couple of units It's literally a click You can hold down the Z button and Zirklings will come out You did all the work already Now, just enjoy it It actually is more like making a mojito, which is a lot of work People underestimate how difficult it is to make cocktails Making cocktails is a crap ton of work You have to do all these things, like it's this tiny drink and then you have through all these actions and put in five different ingredients Then you have your cocktail and then you just leave it and you don't drink it That's basically what he's doing It's waiting there for you. It has alcohol inside of it and it's going to make you feel good It's the same with the Zirklings Dude, you have 12 larva, just freaking build some units I don't even care what it is Hell, it, no, actually I do care what it is Just build links and go into Baines But I don't mind Lurkers either. get a fort base or something he needs something no is it how is this possible oh they're all at this one ah they're all at the hatchery that he didn't have hotkeyed that makes a little bit of sense is it does he have combat shield now yeah yeah he's combat shield his graphics look weird high graphics not used to that i was playing on low graphics otherwise confuses the small proto's brain seismic spines on the way okay the range upgrade how is the idea here to get 30 links in his army? Why? A single bainling? Okay, there we go 14 bainlings Now that's better That's more like it Okay You see his entire army is here Just take this base for God's sake. Just do it, my friend What? Why would he What? Okay What is this move? What is the goal of this move? You just, the last thing he saw is a massive Marine Army here, which he can't beat with this What is the goal of this? You always got to wonder, like, what is the point of going there right now? It's not like you're going to be able to defend this drone If he was still there, you would have lost everything If he's not there, you might be called out of position now, and you'll have your bailing solo This was a negative move It would have been better if you had done nothing Absolute negative unit movement Holy crap. Okay, he's getting some paintings at least Command center, command center I like what How many? He has 18 barracks Do you think this guy is not aware of how reactors work maybe? He's still queuing up three Marines in every single barrack This is absolutely fantastic I love this Okay, he scans, no stim yet by the way Also hasn't started his 2-2 yet Okay, look at this Out of position because he wanted to defend this base Links get rallied in Nice Good start Who's all of your links? Here come the banlings Here come the banlings Here come the banlings Look at the banlings Lurking is doing some work here that's when you send in the banlings. So basically, you defend the lurkers with the banlings Lurkers are damaged over time and the banlings are damaged at once So the longer you can keep the bailings alive, the more damage your lurkers can do because there's basically this wall that explodes in front of you, you know? He needs to send in guys It's basically like the orc in Helms deep, you know He needs to send a couple of these, these bearers of the flame, the flame barriers into to blow up the thing, to make sure that they can enter And those are the banlings You need to blow up the banlings And in order to do that, you need human sacrifice And the Marines need to do that. But in this case, well, I'm not quite sure where my analogy with Lord of the Rings is going, but the human sacrifice now got forced, which wasn't great The analogy went, no, I will forgive myself, okay? Two okay ones already today So if you fail a third one, that's completely fine It happens to the best, okay? Can't always be perfect Or never perfect Always mediocre at least So, it's fine Look at these marines as well How many kills do they have between them? Three, two Oh, well, they died Seven on these two and five on the others That's a lot of kills He actually What's the units lost? It looks worse because the supply dropped so much, but it's just marines. And marines are 50 minerals I was going to say it's just minerals And I said it's just Marines Have to the bad Both starts with an M There's an I in both as well and there's an A in both Like it's too many things there An R? Minerals? Nice Yeah, yeah Marines S? A lot of similarities there An I Minerals? Yeah I'm doing a good job here I am completely aware of how the alphabet works I really dislike that he's not building any Baines anymore But I also kind of understand it If you can get a very good lurker count at this point, you might be fine But at some point you're also going to Oh my jeez, Lord. Why would he burrow straight in front of him? Pull the drones, yeah For sure Because you already have so many drones You can lose a couple out of your 47 Complete clown No, why would you unborrow? What? You're winning the fight You know, you need to go back and you need to burrow again Yeah, you've got to lose the base How is it possible that he just makes bad moves again and again and again? I wonder if he would have given this army to the AI easy, if the AI easy would have been able to do a better job with it That's the lowest point for me, by the way It's like the dumbest AI that there is. If the AI Easy would have done a better job, I wish we could take over replays with the AI Easy to see those things I'm really curious I'm not quite sure if he would have been able to win that fight AI Easy is really bad as well, but man, this Zirk player is trying hard to lose Once again out of position, has he ever had any vision on the map? Didn't he complain about his opponent's map vision, but his opponent constantly has had pretty decent map vision? Just because he has a massive stream of Marines coming across the map, he sees like half the map He has bases on every single base Like, he sees everything. Half the map is covered in either barracks, marines or command centers 24 barracks What are we? 1-1 Oh, 2-2 is about to finish, actually You even realize He splits pretty well This guy knows how to use Marines I just can't believe he hasn't gotten stim yet Because he might think it's better not to if you don't want to build Metafax, but then why don't you want to build Metafax? T Inba This actually was a game He literally only built Marines 69 remaining Nice 434 Marines lost More Marines lost than Links That is extremely rare He lost no gas units whatsoever This is the dumbest game I've seen in my life Let me pick your imbalance complaint for him again Marine. I meet a T on letter He played bio, but don't build a any Metafek or tank He only produced Marine without stim Every part of his macro is suck and incorrect No, no, no His macro, well, actually, his macro wasn't great Okay, this guy was queuing up a lot of Marines, but he was building a lot He had a lot of production He realized that he wasn't brilliant at it So what he did was he got a lot of production and just continued building Marines all the time A steady flow of marine can still combat my army with Bain and Lurker This is actually not a fact None of these fights were even. Every single fight you had, you were down 80 supply, then you killed 90 supply of his, and you lost like 35 supply yourself, but because your opponent was outmining you so hard, because you're constantly floating 1K and having 25 larvae in the bank Yeah, obviously All right, let's give you two things, three things I want to judge you on three things First of all, your macro Like I mentioned, your macro, honestly, it should be good Your injects were good Your creep spread was honestly good as well Your build order was good The only problem is you got a supply block a couple of times, but it's platinum leak I'm okay with that. But why don't you use your larva? You're constantly floating 10 to 20 larva All you need to do is use them and you would be fine So for that, sadly, I'll have to give you a suck I don't want to, okay? Your control Your control was terrible It just wasn't good You were constantly out of position The fights you took always. sacrificed either the links first or immediately through in the Bain links you were out of position with your lurkers which I guess is a little bit of map control added in there as well but we'll count it in your micro or just unit control yeah it just it wasn't good enough but then again your army also kind of sucked and so you'll get a suck on micro because well it wasn't good and the final one is unit composition and this is really that was just too painful to watch is you messing hydras, getting more links, fighting without bainlings, like just mess bainling If your opponent is building mass marine, you mess bainling. And something people often do in this case is to go like, well, but if I mess bainling, what if he has tanks? It's like, but he didn't, you know? Like, if my grandma had wheels, should be a bicycle. Like, this is not it, you know? like he only built marines balings would work okay that yeah that's it you sucked your unit composition sucked your micro sucked your macro sucked and you my friend also suck nice all right it's going to be it for this episode of is it imba or do I suck if you did enjoy it and you didn't think this episode sucked be sure to leave a tomb's up down below leave a comment if you want higher level games lower level games If you want more Chinese replays, I'm a big fan of the Chinese replays personally Good descriptions They tend to be kind of wonky the games Some good imbalance complaints Yeah, that's it. Subscribe to the channel, all that good jazz And I'll see you all next time Thanks so much Bye-bye."

        "text": "Dear Harstam, first of all, I realize I'm not an amazing StarCraft 2 player I only started playing last year, but I have reached Platinum League I know that I laps in my micro, but I felt my macro was decent this game My supply stayed up and I consistently had more workers and army Here's what I thought I played well 1 I controlled the mid game 2 I maintained good army supply Here are some of the ways I can improve Holy crap, this guy wrote an essay Um, number one My mineral lines were oversaturated Two, my drops were not effective Shield batteries prevented worker damage, so I just tried to depower buildings All they did was keep Protos on his side of the map. Three, I did not micro my army well I struggled to micro drops and pushes at the same time, so I tend to do one or the other My opponent just A moves with a dead ball Four, I get supply capped If I played perfectly, I would not be in Platinum League I believe, overall, I'd played better than my opponent I had significantly better macro and was more proactive My opponent macroed like Silver League and never moved out As my boxing coach used to say, you don't have to be the best, just better than the other guy I believe I have stronger fundamentals than the Protos player Early game. I scout what I think is an all-in, so I built a couple of bunkers on the low ground. I scouted again and lost my Reaper. But I saw two Adepts and a Forge. At this point I'm confident it is a one base all-in with plus one, possibly Glaives or Charge if he proxied his Twilight Council. I wasn't certain, but I play against a lot of all-ins on the ladder. I built two bunkers and wait for the push, which never came. Mid-game I took firm control of the game. I denied his third base for a time before pushing at 10 minutes and 14 minutes. In these fights I traded with my opponent well. I took better engagement, I maintained an advantage in army supply and workers, after the engagement at 14 minutes He had two army, two supply to my 70 With my next push Jesus! With my next push, I aimed to take the position between his natural and third to end the game I had the upgrade advantage, I had the army advantage, and a composition that should trade well in a fight This is where I lost the game I ced my tank and EMP this army, which had flanked mine I thought I had the composition and numbers to take the fight, mostly marauders with concussive shells to deal with Colossi and Zealots He A-moved with Zealots and Colossi. After being a head-all game, he A-moved me and I lost I probably could have taken the fight if I had split and stutter-step multiple groups of marauders I used my splash damage spell I had the high ground I had tank siege I had the upgrade advantage He A-moved with half my number of Zealot and Colossi and ended the game I could have taken a better engagement if I had microed and dropped at the same time He gave me a bad-manner, G-G, so I floated my buildings He continued to badmatter me after the game Here is the imbalance Tarrant does not have the ability to rebound from a bad engagement I was not that after the last fight, but I was behind. Reinforcements can only trickle in from the main base instead of being warped in all at once, when and where I need them My main comeback spells, EMP and anti-armor missile only work if I have already a critical mass of Marine slash marauder They alone cannot equalize the game, especially against supply-efficient units like Archons and Colossi and Colossi Storm and Colossi, on the other hand, can variably and proactively equitally equalize the game, even from behind When two imperfect players compete, Protos can have worse fundamentals, play more passively, and still win, because Taran is punished more for any mistake So, Harstam Is it Inba or do I suck? Good Lord! This is like your thesis defense You wrote an entire thesis here, my friend. It's an actual essay That took me almost four minutes to read That is not okay, okay? I'm going to deduct some grades of your final grade for that already, because it seems like we have quite a scholar here, so I'm going to grade him like he's back in school And I'll be grading him on a couple of things, of course, and we'll all do that at the end But for now, the question is, is it Inba or does he suck? School edition And five-minute initial essay edition. this is the longest letter I think I've ever gotten and now don't think that you're going to be funny and write an even longer letter because I'm not even going to read it usually I don't really like I only read the top part like the first two lines and if I think it's good I open the OBS and start recording and I think that that process of mine now needs to be changed because of people like what's he called egg bird Egbert you're ruining my workflow and I think this is about to ruin your life all right all right. Well, do you have here we can we can skip the early game a little bit it's not going to be too too interesting i think just making sure that both players have something that resembles a build order well the terran has something that resembles a build order i think he cut one worker temporarily but hey we're in platinum league these are not the things that i truly care about all right the reaper starts orbital command should start immediately then he should walk down with it yeah it's all a little bit slow it's all a little bit slow it's all a little delayed but and his opponent is opening two gate tried to reaper wall and then failed the reaper wall so so far one oh for the terror it's like it's like watching a football match between two guys and one guy constantly is hitting the ball with his hands but the other guy is still stuck in his shirt and doesn't know how to put on the shoes the correct way in this analogy the guy without the shirt is the pro post player and the guy is slapping the ball with his hands is the Taron but yeah it's not looking too great so far all right is it's not the cleanest game in the first two and a half minutes i like this riding style more than i like his build order okay interesting call pulls always workers and throws down a forge sometimes when i watch lower level games it feels like time moves slower but it's not actually things just go a lot slower. It's like watching a turtle and you're not quite sure if it's in slow motion or not It's like, no, that's really the speed of the turtle Okay, so he scouts he scouts forge at the three minute mark and two adapts And he sees that there's no second base Now, a forge upgrade would hit about, what is it? Two minutes, yeah Two minutes from now So he knows that if this is an actual timing attack and his opponent is going to use the forge, he won't really need to over prepare for it until two minutes from now. This is something you always got to keep in mind, is that if you scout a dark shrine, the moment it starts, you still have about 70, yeah, 75 to 80 seconds, in combination with the DTs having to walk to your base, of course, to respond to it And the worst thing to do is to respond immediately because then you're cutting most of the time economy or infrastructure, while you don't need to, to do that yet This is why very often at lower levels, just building a dark shrine is worth it because the other person will immediately overreact, getting like three cannons in every base, and then you don't even have to build a single DT, and it's already worth it. As we see Egbert kind of, I mean, I don't mind his, what he's doing here, you know, second bunker for safety I understand that It is kind of overreacting initially, and he doesn't really have any follow-up Also, if he thinks he's going to get attacked, Isn't it really weird to play two Helions? The Helion probably is the worst defensive unit in the game against Protos Like it doesn't actually beat any unit that Protos has Mine is better against Adept, mine is better against Zellets, tank, cyclone, all better defensive units The Helion is good for scouting So I wouldn't have minded if he would have built one and send it across the map for scouting. But that's not at all what Egbert is doing here Oh, I'm miscontrol a little bit My bet Egbert's going to send his first Liberator across the map and is up Sorry, I can't count He's up ten workers He was nine workers See the Protos go for a rope Where is his cannons? Very odd game here Very odd Two eBayes Okay Now, this is what we call a classic non-bill order Okay So how do you recognize a non-build order? It's very simple It is whenever you see someone build two e-base, well, they have zero gas and 600 minerals in the bank He still needs to build his tech labs, his reactors He probably wants to get another tank after this. He needs to start, at some point, he's going to need to start his combat shield as well These two e-base are not going to get used for quite some time. Well, these are all small errors compared to what the Protos is doing so far, because yeah the pro the protos has a real daughter here that i haven't seen before it's just in chess i think they call this a completely unique game you know because chess very often has repeat moves so like the first like five moves very often are they've been played like a million times before and they're like this massive database of moves now if we had this massive database of games i feel like after a minute like maybe after the five seconds we already had a completely unique game because the things big dirty and Egbert are doing here are quite unique Okay, Colossi, Twilight Council. Has he? Okay, he has plus one That's cool Egbert meanwhile, oh, starting is plus one One of the eBay is working now Second eBay is going to start, no, not going to start Third Cc I mean, Egbert definitely is macroing better here So far, I'd give him about a is six, six out of ten Okay, we're going to be using the Dutch grading system I never understand how the letters work Like, A is the best, F is the worst But I don't quite know what corresponds with like a sufficient grade Like, is a C fine or is it D still fine? And you also have like pluses Like what is it D plus? Is D plus better than D minus? I'm not sure. I actually don't know I think D plus is better because A plus is the highest So it makes sense But I'm not sure. Like, for like if you get a six you know you can you can pass on to the next grade or whatever if everything's a six I guess it would be like a D or a C B would be like a seven eight A would be nine or a a plus would be that something like that I think we're just going to be using numbers easier from my brain so far his macro and build order has been about a six and a half give it it's good enough you know we can live with it it is probably better than the average platinum player, I would say. So yeah, six, what I say? Six and a half? Yeah, six and a half, I think is absolutely fair Maybe a six But pushing towards six and a half That's what I'll give Egbert so far Protos player hasn't scouted anything yet, by the way I mean, why would you scout? This guy is so brilliant He's like, I can save 50 minerals of a probe by not scouting, and instead of that, I'll just build cannons all around my base That will only cost me what? Three, three, three There's like 900, a couple of batteries next to it, like 1,200 to 1,200 minerals. But then he gets to save the cost of one extra probe that he could send across the map or the cost of an observer, which is 25 minerals, 75, yeah, so that's really nice, yeah This is a great economical thinking here out of Big Dirty But we're here to look at Eckert, my bad, sorry, guys Focusing on Eckbert Okay, moves across the map He's looking pretty okay I'm not going to lie And then shockwave on the way, he's up 20 supply He has stim He has combat shield He has plus one You see a job He said, you see a job. This always kind of pains me is how unaware people are of the dangers that could be there, you know? Like he just went to this pylon, walked forward with the tanks Like 25 charlesots arrived from the left side He would be in a world of trouble But luckily that didn't happen But it's just one of these things that to me is crazy because I know if these tanks were exposed and I'd be playing against it, I'd be on top of that with the Z I'm so fast, guys I don't want to brag, but when it comes to A moving on top of tanks, yeah, that's my specialty I feel like this orbital has been here for a while. You can see that by the fact that there has 99 energy already 63 workers He mentioned a slight oversaturation, though So it would be pretty lame if we then start complaining about the oversaturation That would be pretty lame This is something that is really a classic mistake out of the Terran and that is when you're ahead in general, this is not just for Terran, but when you're ahead in general, so you have an extra base over your opponent, your opponent is on two base and you're on three What you can do is you can just sit back because the longer the game goes, the better it gets for you And what you start preparing is basically a next timing push. So you start investing with your advantage into a future timing push so that you're sure that he can never take a third base again Now that could look like exactly getting two-two upgrades, getting that enhanced shockwave and probably already having this base mining for a bit I didn't like the double drop too much because dropping into a two-base toss, I mean the distance between the main and the natural is so small that it tends to not be very useful So I wouldn't, what is this? It's almost like an arrow You know, you can kind of see it here It's like an arrow and then here would be a line behind It's kind of a lame arrow though. Yeah, it's not really an arrow at all It's just five pilots randomly built Never mind I always try to, you know, look for intention when very often there's no intention whatsoever It's just incompetence That's okay as well Okay I mean, the Terran is just absolutely winning here Taryn has no idea that he's winning Once again goes for a double drop This time I don't mind it as much But the Terran doesn't know that this is better now because he isn't aware that there's a third base coming up Very often when you're dropping, you also want to be doing something somewhere else But, I mean, he mentioned that he doesn't have an easy time multitasking. So we're going to have a quick look at his multitasking This is not really multitasking This is something that Terrans do as well I hate to generalize, but it's always the Terrans as well It's just because you're dropping with two MetaVex doesn't mean you're multitasking Multitasking, multi, not many people know this, but multi actually is the Latin word for many Both of them have an M as well, so you can kind of see how that went over the ages, you know, from Latin. you go to Spanish and then from Spanish to like the Germanic languages and Germanic language to bam British English and you have many multi means many and task is something that you're doing so for example dropping however this was just a mono task this was not multitasking this was mono and mono that is actually an Italian word not many people know this Italian word and it means one That's the, it's, yeah, mono, two, three, quater It's the first four in Italian What hell, Kevin? So he just did monotasking, but because it's dropping, he pretends like it's multitasking But there's a big difference here We're going to follow him once again Let's see how the multitasking this time is going to happen. I'll just speed it up a bit Oh? Fly's back home Wait, am I actually on his camera? No way, right? Okay, yeah, I'm on his camera now Okay, look at this Here comes the multitasking So he queues up the drops Starts a planetary He's maxed, by the way Now would be a perfect time to hit a timing He has two two upgrades He has the upgrade for Ghost He has a massive army supply advantage Then he flies into a cannon Then he drops Okay, and now the multitask comes in You can't pretend that you're doing many things at the same time and say that that's one of the reasons why you're not controlling your army so well. The reason why you're not controlling your army so well is because you just don't have very good army control And that's okay to say But don't lie to me It's a little bit messed up Deducted one grade for lying The maximum you can get right now is a nine It's kind of messed up, my friend It's kind of messed up lying to your mentor, your teacher, the man who's supposed to give you advice So he moves forward Helion, as a scout, I like that, I don't mind that Decides to attack, oh, crap, accidentally pressed the plus Straight into the base with lots of cannons, but I mean, there's cannons everywhere, so I don't even really mind it. Perhaps a scan forward to see what the army is looking like That would have been nice, especially because he does have, he doesn't have that many, actually He does have one scan available, but not that many Yeah, it's a win I still feel like that a lot of the micro is negative micro No? If you just look at these armies and how the fight went here, let's just have a quick look at how my man controls everything here, okay? So he has What does he have? What's he doing? He has everything in the same control group, so it's probably just F2 which means he can EMP but he just move commanding forward now Okay, then he EMPs Now comes the stim. Now comes to stim Now comes to stim Now comes to He moves forward again So we're not con He just stimmed twice? Then right clicks a Pylon Yeah, I think if he just A-moved, it would have actually been better Because now This wasn't even stutter stepping either Why does he Why does he Why does he lie? He said he was micron like stutter stepping There's everything in one control group, which means that if you're if you would be stutter stepping back, the Vikings also start stutter stepping back He's up 80 supply He can just send anything across the map, no? He's like 70 more army supply There's a bunch of units in here as well. He's still afraid of that early game all in That early forge really did something to him to his mental state okay so he leaves these tanks to die then ready it it goes for it which has a good EMP okay you probably want to get these over as well now it's maybe it's okay actually that's not enough meta-fax Vikings could land Vikings could land he's not F2ing though you see that so he just control groups everything in one control no no this was an F2 never mind no no He's an afterware He's an F2er Oh, whoa I lied Okay So these works aren't doing anything We have 4K minerals What's our production of like? We have five barracks, two factories. Why do we have two factories? That doesn't matter Okay, so this is a piece of advice that I very often give here in this series And it's actually very simple And it's basically don't copy the pro gamers production Okay People very often, they look at pro gamers and they go, hey, this pro gamer has five barrens a factory and a star port on three base I'm going to do the same thing But that's not how it works You should be trying to copy the early game of the pro gamer, but if you're floating 4K minerals and a thousand gas, there's no shame in adding three barracks Okay, I'm not going to deduct any points minus 0. 25 for this, okay? Just small amount, but it's, this is an ego thing most of the time, okay? And having an ego isn't very good if you want to become a Starcraft player, because most of the time we're just going to spend losing games. It's just a how it is okay it's that's the rule of Starcraft 2 no one actually wins there's like two guys at the top that win it's Cheryl Rainer now you have Clemmas well and there's a bunch of Korean dudes to take all of our money it's like there's no shot okay you're a foreign you're a foreign terran player in the entire history of Star Wars like three foreign terran players that want to turn in it now is not the time for an ego but you manage to to get across the map, which is nice Still only single MetaVac is kind of low, huh? Okay, there's nuke's as well Okay You're not. Are you really microing? I'm not sure if you're actually micro-er just moving your army You know what I mean? Yeah, I don't think this counts as micro You're just moving the army and I say, look, I'm micro It's like the guys that do push-ups, but in reality, they just go like this They never really go like this, you know They just shaking their arms really fast and counting at the same time That's what you're doing as well It doesn't count You can't just move back and forth a couple of times. still you're very far ahead and you're winning by a lot you're going to hit another timing a 3 3 timing this time around you're going to be up like 80 supply you're going to be up three upgrades but yeah the micro definitely is an issue and not the fact that you do it poorly but the fact that you do it at all you should probably just a move like stim and a move is probably better at this point ooh cloakers I like this eggbird nice oh look even splitting them up i feel like you have a lot of potential egbert i'm not i'm not gonna lie you're you're a scholar first of all intelligent person i could see that immediately after reading your essay okay you split them up just for them to come together whoop whoop whoop there's no observer it's gonna work no there's an observer it's not work. I was a good attempt You know, I could say, well, maybe you need to split them up rather than F3 at the same spot and then maybe he would do more damage But don't believe the haters, Egbert I think it was cool And sometimes, even if something is bad, it is more important than that it's cool than that it's bad, you know? You know what I'm saying? It's like clothes as well It's like if we didn't care at all about how cool they were. everyone would just be walking around in sweatpants because they're the best they have large pockets they're comfortable they keep you warm um yeah that's it really the only things that matter but now people want to look cool in their clothes and it's the same here you know basically the thing that you just you just bought 500 dollar pens from calving klein i think they sell pans probably or diva levi pens aren't that expensive armani pens 500 500 000 is what you just bought okay and you're always going to have the haters that say well why wouldn't you just buy cheaper pants and it's the same here you're always going to have haters that say why wouldn't you just send one goes to this base and one goes to this base and one goes here and move your army at the same time or maybe use your three three timing but these people aren't cool and they don't have the same drip you know they don't have the same style sheesh that's fire lit lit it's for the zoomers my metrics show that mainly people above I think it's like 35 watch my videos so the last few days I've been studying TikTok to see what's cool these days for the the zoomers the kids the generation X the pre-millanials and words like sheesh and lit do very well is what I've mentioned is what I've is what I've found okay here we have another attack so basically what happened here here is initially our good friend Terran was up about 50 or 60 army supply and up three upgrades. Then he decided to wait as long as it took for this Protos to get his plus one armor upgrade and to get another 90 army supply as well So that's very cool Very, very cool indeed So the Protos has less workers, has a bigger army, and on top of that, look at this Four Marines, two Marines, that is six, six supply. then there's from here 10 supply for marauders 18 supply so we have about what 20 23 supply over here oh another tank in here marauder so you're missing about let's say 30 supply you're already down 12 supply so basically this is 95 supply okay 95 supply is 90 maybe against 136 so you're down 45 46 supply in this fight let's keep that in mind Okay, you're up two upgrades, which always is important Oh, good Lord, you hit good EMPs, very good EMPs even Okay, one more time Did she just walk into your opponent's Arcons? It's over here Okay, so the tank shoot, we get a stim. No, no, everything, the same control group, so he needs the EMP first, because the ghost has priority Most of them are just walking Now they start shooting After he loses 40 supply, he starts shooting He hasn't stinted He hasn't stipped his opponent That was a terrible fight Okay, now what you're supposed to do is you start base trading like your life depends on it You have a crap ton of money It's still maybe possible, okay? You put the tank here on the high ground You get like a bunker over here or something and you just, you start dropping the other side Like get this base down, get this base down. Maybe go into their main base, try to get their production as well with whatever you have Okay. that is all you can do right now it's literally the own maybe if he go over here and you have a lot of money and you're oh my god you're lacking gas you have a lot of bases though you can't float one okay you have a single drop i kind of like that single drop but you need to remember that you're already down a lot so you actually yeah you probably need to do like a full base trade or you can't base trade at all like full base trade scenario like this is you can't have half it you know you need to yeah need to fully do it is this single drop gonna force this entire arm what is this rule what are you doing here okay he drops four to the right and four on the left he wanted to flank the probes in the gas and something i haven't seen before okay recall forces an army back it's possible guys it's possible okay picks up once again the mono task are going very strong orbital command flying over this he's workers doing you want to send them into gas No? No, maybe no. Oh Ah, very unfortunate Probably got F-tooth Yeah, I got F-toothed Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Yeah, nice try I like this though This is a good move This is a very good move The F-2 wasn't a good move, but the rest was fine These workers here is like an outpost I once heard that A strategy to detonate landmines is that they would send a bunch of goats into like a minefield and then the mines would explode on the goats to clear like minefields I can't remember where this was Remember hearing about it It could also be an urban myth These SEVs tried doing the same, except there were no mines but storms. Maybe just testing the waters, I don't know Maybe it's not the same at all, but I just want to share that anecdote Okay 135 supply to 136 So army supply relatively close But at this point, the army quality of the Protos is actually a million times better He has so many heavy tech units Look at that Colossi, seven Arcons, nine Templar, two storms each Did I say four immortals already? I think so It's like massive, massively over-tapped army And his opponent is super basic This is basically a tier one army, you know, Marines, marauders, two tanks that had cleared immediately, and a single Viking He doesn't stim again But why? Yeah, this wasn't a very close fight at all. This really wasn't a very close fight Okay, well, this game is pretty over now I mean, if you can't win when you're up 90 supply, it's hard for me to be believe that you win being down 80 supply The offensive DG, I guess Big Dirty had similar thoughts aside He was like, all right, I was really dead this game and now I won like four fights in a row There's no way I'm losing this Agbar Gigi's back as well Oh, is he floating? I think he's floating Let's see what's going to happen here then I think he mentioned some bad manner as well I guess the G G is pretty bad manner I do not approve of the Gigi. I don't think it's a cool thing to do, but it was pretty funny You know, sometimes you just Nice recall Nice recall Hop Back home immediately Beautiful recall click there Wow That is not doing much of anything I mean he's completely that right he's actually completely dead yeah there's just there's gonna go home right she's gonna stall for a bit now or what because marina marauder go down there's still a little bit of army left in the main base and some marines and marauders here but yeah the rest of this seems pretty over no he's actually gonna float we'll just speed it up a bit then Stop It's over Enjoy how? You give me a bad manner, Gigi. How? Okay, this was a mistake You can already feel it There's too long of a break And we know Egbert is a big fan of writing essays So I'm expecting Oh, you said DJ then they resigned That's not too bad He is correct Egbert is correct It was a little bit bad manner The game was completely over You weren't still in the game It was over, Edward Let's not fool ourselves here, my friend This guy feels like a fake version, yo What? Question mark, explanation mark? What did he say before? Stop It is over He sounds like someone that you'd see in like the drug prevention videos You know? When there's like three kids like smoking weed and then he comes over. Stop, guys It's over Didn't you know that drugs are bad for you? And then the other three smoking meat, oh, we had no idea It's like, yes, drink some water instead That is way better than those nasty drugs You know who uses drugs? Losers Oh, we're no losers Nice And then they all smile at the camera and like they wave like this or something like this Like some 80s drug prevention video Actually like Big Dirty would be great for this What? I'm going to make a sandwich See ya I had upgrade advantage all game 75 mineral structure shuts down all the rest. What structure is he talking about? The cannon? Does he think cannons call 75? Or the battery? He probably thinks the battery cost 75 Get EMP to attack through a choke into an army with better upgrades? Is he just making up fights? Or did I just miss half the game? I feel like both of these guys saw a different game than I did I can't believe people actually do this to each other Why wouldn't you just leave? You're wasting your own time, no? Don't they have better things to do? Big dirty wins And this proves that it actually was Egbert who sent in the replay because he left the game after Why would you send this in? I'd be embarrassed to show this. Holy crap I'm gonna have to give you a grade now, don't I? All right Um, I don't even know where to start Okay, let's start Let's start with your lies I think you lost two full points for that at this point So from a 10, you went to an 8 already Okay, that's a starting point I also, because you have an ego, I took out minus 0 25 You cried so much during the game and then you flowed it It's like, turn the other cheek or be a bigger man, you know, this wasn't it So another minus 1 75 So it's nice, you know, the 0 25 that I deducted earlier Right now you're in a 6 6. If you played absolutely perfect this game, just because you lied and because you're a little bit of a dick, you already have six right now Okay? You forgot the stim in two of the fights, the most important spell that Terran has that increases DPS by a crepton You just didn't use it For every fight you didn't stim, minus one Right now you're at a four, okay? At a four Your timings make absolutely no sense. you're up like 60-70 supply then you wait until you're not up in supply anymore the upgrade gap gets closed a little bit more and then you attack that was the last fight you get minus one for that last fight for the timing of the fight you get um yeah so you're at you're at three right now i think okay then the early game to mid game it wasn't great but i think it was good enough Like you played as a platinum level player, and you did okay You know, you had a semi-build order, you attacked at an okay timing, you got very far ahead. Then afterwards, you lost four tanks for free, so I'm going to take another, for the first three fights together, I'm also going to give you minus one Then you'll have two left Yeah, actually, I think that's a fair, that is completely fair for you You didn't really micro, You, so you lost a lot for that You're a bit of a prick, and all your timings were bad The only thing that you did do relatively well is that you just had a lot of crap, especially in the first 15 minutes You had a lot of crap, and you moved it across the map at times That is really just what you did. And you get a 2 out of 10 for that, so I'm sorry, sir. You have to redo this year, and you suck. That's going to be my judgment. You can, of course, appeal at the exit. board or the exam commission and we'll have some other people look at it but until then you suck and yeah no graduation for you I'm sorry all right there's going to be it for this episode of is it imba or do I suck if you thought this was a fantastic episode be sure to hit the like button that's very nice be sure to subscribe to the channel and share this with your friends and with your family as well of course nothing better than watching IOLIS together with your brother your sister or your cousin, your dad, your mom, your grandma or grandpa It's not like the average age of my YouTube videos can get any higher anyway, so that's all good Thanks for watching. Bye-bye."

        "text": "Dear Mr Flaming Lips, first of all, I want to stress that I am better looking than you, and second of all, Zerk is Imba These are two claims that I find rather unlikely The economy they can acquire through larva and in combination with those mega-cheap roaches make them unbeatable I opened up with a classic D T surprise attack I killed his natural while taking a third myself After harassing with Arconnes, I saw he had four basis, so I decided to attack because of my advantage at the start Even when my disruptor had the most immense hit you could imagine, I lose my whole army Hit after hit, I take away roaches with the disruptor, but defeat was inevitable. What should I have done better? Is Zurich with roaches imba, or do I suck? Orion Orion is a master's protos player from Europe Now, first of all, Orion, you really think you're better looking than me? Unlikely, but we can test this at the end, okay? Let's first have a look at your I O disclaim Roaches are mega cheap, is what you said? I agree with that They're extremely cheap And you said the Zirk economy made it even better or something I don't know I already can't remember your eyes from, I'm too focused on you thinking you're a better-looking guide on me, which I just find a ridiculous statement Ridiculous. Opening up with a decent little thing here though, sending out that worker to go block your opponent's natural is something I like to see It's always good to force your opponent to take their natural on their third base location, makes them drones walk a little bit further, cost them a little bit of eco, obviously also cost the Protols a little bit of eco to get that propout early on the map, but tends to be worth it for the Protos player On top of that forces your opponent to split his drones like farther away from each other So if you're doing something like a glaive attack, it's going to be harder for him to defend his bases. If the Zirk does something like this where they're really keen on actually trying to take their natural and like they're, you know, they're not going anywhere, you should just throw down a pylon Job well done if you ask me Yeah No? You do it You do it You do it You do it You do a have to go up into the main base? No? Why would you even scout if you're not going to scout? What? How does that even make any sense? That's like going to holiday to check out the airport What's wrong with you? You went out You went out. there already check the pool timing you moron good lord now he plays corby for nexus that's absolutely insane this actually now he goes back in sees hey it actually was hatch first with a late pool oh my god my corby for nexus for no reason corby for nexus is really bad against serg um it a fast adapt doesn't do as much as it does against taran and that's really the only advantage as is the fast adept, which means a faster scout and a faster unit to fight of the Reaper This makes no sense You rush out your cyber, okay, let me just stress how insane this entire thing was that just happened here, okay? He opens up with Corby for Nexus. In order to do this, you're delaying your second gas, you're cutting off two workers approximately, like you have to cut one of your workers here temporarily, and also because your next is later, you're going to miss about one and a half to two workers because every 12 seconds your Nexus is delayed, your Nexus is just missing a worker because a probe takes 12 seconds to build You get, you rush out a core at a pretty big cost for Prodos in PVZ Then look at what you do, okay? The advantage you get from Corby for Nexus is about a 10 second faster core The entire sequence that Orion goes for here is a thing of beauty. loses the resources of going core before nexus core finishes at 205 which already is impressive because it's supposed to finish at two minutes at a low ground okay maybe 201 i'm fine with that this core is four seconds late already for the core first okay 205 it finishes then he doesn't use the core for at least 10 seconds Exactly 10 seconds He just waits for the timing where it would finish on a Nexus first and then start his warpgate This is like getting an insurance for your house And then when your house burns down, it's just buying a new house and never contacting your insurance It doesn't make any sense The only advantage you get is either faster warpgate or a faster adapt. Your adept starts later than my adept starts How is that even possible? And then to make it all worse, you make up the 10 seconds that you just lost by delaying your warp gate by chrono boosting it immediately So not only do you waste initial minerals and gas by going on Corby for Nexus, then you don't start your warp gate, but then in order to have your warp gate finish at a timing that it would finish with a Corby for Nexus, you put on a chrono boost It absolutely beyond me what you're doing here Absolutely beyond me Holy crap I love how you waited, legit, 16 seconds to start an adapt, only then to chrono boost an adapt. A chrono lowers the building time of whatever it is your building by 10 seconds So you're delaying something so that the chrono boost make sure that it comes out at the same time as it usually would have is actually just impressive Okay, Twilight Council He said it went for a classic DT drop The worst thing here is, let me tell you, the worst thing here is that for a DT drop, you don't even need a fast warp gate You don't need a fast warp gate And the reason for that is because you don't need a lot of gate units out You're going to be getting two to three gate units Most of the time you get two actually with DT drop. You can get three if you want You get two gate units before you warping your DTs And because your prison makes it to the other side of the map at around 4 30-ish, 432, 431, you're not going to get your warp You don't need your warp gate done before like 420 or 410 So you can even delay your warp gate, pretend that it's a star gate Is it possible to maybe also just put the darks right here now that you're showing your opponent everything in the future? Just make it easier At least if you put your dark shrine here, you won't have any clue what's happening He's like, ah, there's a dark shrine there There's no way this guy is such an idiot. You know, it's tricking them, making them believe that there's no way you can be this dumb But you, my friend, are four minutes in You're already breaking records Very impressive It's going to get supply block as well 43 out of 46 I'm kidding What is this? This is Masters League, man Get a grip, bro Two probes to build a pilot? I thought they were going to go into the gas and I was going to say, ah nice, he's putting his workers in gas Teamwork Very buddy-body Can do anything by themselves Amazing Absolutely amazing I am a little bit pissy because he thinks he's better looking than me I'm not going to lie. So I might be going a little bit harder on him than I would usually But you know, it's a consequence of his actions Maybe that's the one thing that he should learn in life, is that his poor actions have consequences as well, you know Yeah, if you start your cybercore 10 seconds earlier, then not do anything with it for 10 seconds and then Kronobo boost it, that sucks Just like if you send an email to me saying that you're definitely better looking than me, yeah, you're gonna get it A consequence, mate You're actually Nice timing, by the way, on the DTs Absolute clown I'm sure you're real glad right now that. you got that cybercore first look at this look at it for 4dd finishes at 5 minutes we're 5 minutes into this game and his timing's already hitting a solid 30 seconds too late impressive very impressive he's not even walking them either oh here we go where are they going oh he thinks the third base is here does he now think that his opponent is on 2 base or what i love this broadcasting to his opponent that there's a prism here very smart This opponent has 31 links, all of them out of position Amazing Gets the spore His opponent also has a Ford base on the way already This guy also is one hell of a dude No spore in the main base. Okay, this game is actually just completely over, like 100% over There's a nice supply block here at 6262 How long has that been going on? I hope that hamster puts like a timer on that Just making sure so we know how long he's been supply block on 62 I have a feeling it's going to be rather long So he walks into here, picks it up I don't mind him not going into the main base because that can be kind of risky You can get surroundings from two sides by queens You don't know what's in the main base Like you can know there's no spore here So I'm completely okay with that, honestly Like, I can tell you, okay, that is fine. Look at 200 energy That's impressive 200 energy on the Nexus Six minutes, 18 seconds Now, I once made a guide on a DT drop It's called DT drop guide, I think And I believe there I had a timing First of all, my initial timing to hit with the DT drop is at like 4 30 Then my second timing I hit Is it like an army that has about, I think it's like 115 or 1 15 10, 120 And let's say 115 I think it's either 110 or 120 So 115, nice in the middle 115 supply at seven minutes on the other side of the map I think I might even have plus one, but I also could not have plus one. I can't remember that Let's see what my good friend Orion manages to do at seven minutes 88 supply So that's about 20-ish supply less No more It's almost 30 supply less And that's very good as well See, this wouldn't have bothered me as much If he hadn't thought that he was also better looking than me, and if he wasn't masters If he was just, you know, a platinum player and he's hitting the timings late from builds that are invented already that have been made before You know what he is? He used to do it yourself, husband. You know, the guy that rather getting a plumber to fix his, I don't know, like his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his sink or whatever, decides that he can just do it himself Even though he has no skills whatsoever in plumbing, just like Orion has no skills whatsoever in StarCraft 2 or the making of build orders, Orion says, you know what? This Harstam guy with his tutorial videos on YouTube and his explanations of what is optimal, probe saturation, you know, building adapt the moment your Cybercore finishes It's fun and all, but how about I just go, I just mess around a little bit myself. then i hit everything 35 seconds later it's like my friend you don't have to reinvent the wheel it's absolutely not necessary there's people out there for you with higher intelligence and better looks that already made build orders just a fact okay nice speed as well on 17 8 pm it's not bad no i can live with that let's take a look at this uh this arc of harass i remember him mentioning did he mention this arkana i'm gonna i'm just gonna keep towing back to this stupid to the stupid one I say Arrassing with my Arcons, I saw he had 4 base, so I decided to attack because of my advantage in the early game. That's what he said, okay? It's an interesting trigger as well, but I like it I like it The thing with 4th bases is, is that a 4th base by itself means nothing This is a bit like if you imagine you want to know if another country has nukes and what they have is they have a factory with a sign that says we make nukes here and then you go aha that's a nuclear factory and then you look on the inside and there's nothing there it's just an empty hall that they use for conventions or something like that you know it's a it's a fake to scare the world something maybe north korea could do it's the same very often with ford bases of a zirk a fort base is only as good as the content of the fort base In this case, this is actually the third base now So you've got to treat it like a third base. And you look at this, you see he isn't even saturating his gases yet Your opponent right now is on 71 workers while you're on 6 No, you're on 71 workers Well, he's on 68 You're up three workers You're up in income against Zirk You're taking a fourth base yourself And you have an army that is increasing in strength every second On top of that you have three upgrades being chrono boosted out right now I hope at least one of them will finish before you attack That should be blink most likely There is zero incentive for you to attack right now Anything that you're doing that isn't just harass is a waste. Look at this! You know something is a good timing when two upgrades are over 60% done and you just invested in a fort base that hasn't gotten you any return on your investment yet Very impressive I also like that you manage to hit three seconds before your blink finishes to really, you know, drive home the point that you absolutely have no clue how upgrades work in this game Two zealous going, I like this move, this is a good move Should have also sent like maybe a DT here or two zealots, but sending away two zealots from your main army is good You had a big hit with a disruptor. But yeah, you attack into the Roach, which is the worst scaling unit in all of StarCraft 2 An army consisting of 200-200 Roach beats nothing There's no other 200-200 army that Masroaches beat They get a journey of this Disruptor Mom, I'm being sent out into the field I bet you're gonna have a great time I think so too, Mom Just hope my commander control controls me well Did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it, did it Kind of got Sarah Carragant here, once again Aye, aye, aye This is just, it's immensely sad Watching you play is immensely sad It gives me a headache It actually does. I decided to record a video in the morning for once and you already ruined my entire day This is People like you are why I can't record videos in the morning He's destroying Mahmoud for the rest of the day It's unbelievable This is a nice run by though It's a good job That's a good job I don't use this one as well It's the only unit you have after all Starting a Colossus at this point, I like it Deciding that a Colossi is better than disruptors against a Masroach army This actually is a good run by It forces him back I like this a lot This is the type of style even when you're behind can really win your games. Well, not in this case because you're really dead, but Like, you can really force your opponent back And if you would have done that earlier, when you still had the this pace as well, maybe you could have even survived a little bit I think it might have been possible It would have been hard, but perhaps possible Sirk, however, is just He's just He's just He's like, oh man, look at his ugly protos It's like, I don't know that he actually is ugly, but I have a feeling that he might not be the best looking at You know, that's probably what the Zurge is thinking right now No match What a name as all It's a good name for StarCraft 2 account. Yeah, you get absolutely blasted here and you have no chance Okay? No chance You did get some big disruptor hits But you're actually down in resources lost Imagine having the most cost inefficient unit in the entire game and then being down in resources lost That's also impressive All right Let's just get into this, guys No, before we get into it, let's go for the other claim to see whether he is prettier than me or not And we're going to do this by statistical analysis, okay? We have a couple of factors He's a protos player that tends to put people, make people good-looking Prodals players good-looking people, okay? So he has got that going for himself He watches harsh them on YouTube. A bit of a downer, you know, it's a minus 10, minus 15% You know, protos naturally 100%, and minus 10% minus 15% or so He's an idiot, minus 15 He probably doesn't know how to wash his face or shower or use towels or any skincare products whatsoever So that's another minus 25 So I think a good guess would be that he's in the, top 50, top 60% of pretty people, just mainly because he plays ProDos And now I found a test online, and I took a picture for it, and we can use this test to determine whether I am prettier or uglier than him So here we go Am I pretty or ugly? Face beauty analysis. this so we kind of put our face into this oval I can adjust the eyes later on here look at the outright eye that looks good left eye that is my left eye indeed we'll put it over here no wait more close to the white somewhere over here then we put this here I think it's a very very it's not a even it's not even one of my greatest pictures you know I just I just snapped this picture randomly I was like I'm not gonna try art I could do a little picture with some makeup on and and all that good jazz but I'm like no I don't I don't need that you know I oh natural I think I'm a good looking guy or well at least better looking than Orion get the side of my face the left most point of my face man I have a massive hat the hairline forehead is a little bit big I have to admit it. What's this? I'm looking for the nose Okay, nose is here Hop and hop Jeez, this is one hell of a test Middle of the mouth, the right most point of the mouth, and the leftmost point of the mouth Now all need to be is about 55% and I get 84 So my friend, first claim, is you prettier than me? I don't think so 84% Look at this Good face shape Normal forehead size Good interocular distance Normal mouth size Small chin and poor face symmetry Which idiot wrote this? Well, whatever So yeah, pretty clear to me Then the second claim. Is this imba? You, my friend, hit 30 seconds late with a DT build, which is one of the easiest builds to execute, Especially because you did nothing with your early game adept So I completely forgot about that So let's define this in three parts First of all, your build order Your build order sucked It was terrible Look like you made it yourself And if you didn't make it yourself, I'd beat up the guy who gave it to you Awful Never play it again Get a real build order Hit tight Get actual units out in time Secondly, your decision making You scout his 4. base but what you forgot is that you killed his natural location base which was his third base which then became his fourth base which is the base you should have scouted to see if it had any contents what you did right now is you saw a sign that said nuclear factory and just started throwing bombs no my friend you had to stay at home and do nothing just sit back your opponent is messing roaches worst unit in the game you could have won this game with a single void right like you could you could have just continued building disruptors at well Fantastic Also, you decided to attack while three of your upgrades weren't done yet. So for that, you get the very rare and unique ESS, boom, atrocious stamp when it comes to decision making And last but not least, you're not a very good-looking person Or at least, not as good-looking as I am So you get the ugly stamp Pop! Three stamps, all negative It can only mean one thing, my friend You suck Nice All right That's going to be it for today's episode of, is it imba or do I suck? And how ugly am I? Thanks everyone for watching I hope you enjoyed it If you did, don't forget to subscribe to the YouTube channel And yeah, that's it Like and all this stuff Thanks so much Appreciate your time Bye-bye."

        "text": "Dear Harstam, I've written you so many times that I'm starting to feel like Stan from that M&M song, LOL Let's be frank, Terran Mac is Inba Demp's Defects, homie It's actually what it says I will shout it from the rooftops if I must So the other day I ran into the A-Taron player ably named Teabag, very indicative of the buttwipping I was about to receive, Winky Face I fully acknowledge I ain't no awesome pro-pleased Play, yeah, once again, really what it says, like you, my shameless attempt at flattery Ha-ha Build orders are kind of like guidelines for me, like parlay for pirates But hey, I love the game and want to have fun That being sad, I had a pretty sweet start. I felt like I scouted well, had good vision, but then the harassment starts Silly benches are annoying and can cloak What nonsense is this? But I rallied, even caught a few drops, and took out a few drop ships and hey, started feeling good about myself At a few engagements where I feel I traded well, I felt the game was about to be in hand I even sent a DT run by, that took out a base Then literally all Mr Teabag does is make a few tanks, a few doors, and boom, my army is routed I thought Immortals were a good counter You referenced that silly infosheet that's in game, and hey, I made those bad boys Guess what? Didn't freaking matter. My army is wiped out and boom There goes the dynamite Game over Terran Mac is outrageously imba Thanks DPS is nuts and Thor's when used in combination with them make them impossible to beat This is literally my 20th letter to you Don't make me throw my PC off a cliff Please see reason and agree Terran Mac is imba Sincerely yours Stan Isn't it your biggest fan? Stan aka sleepless in Seattle Name MS van G Race Protos, league gold MMR, 2,600 All right Let's hop into this replay after these balance reports are getting longer and longer Just because you write more doesn't mean you're more correct You could have probably tried to summarize a little bit, guys, okay? It's a little bit shorter. There's no need to write me entire essays about why you're believe with your 2,600 MMR, my Terran is imbalanced I'm very curious He said build orders are like guidelines Now the beauty of guidelines often is that you don't need to completely stick to them, but that you just have to kind of remain close to them So that is how we are going to be judging MSVenge in this game is seeing how close he will stay with the build order How close will it be? That's going to be one thing that I'm definitely going to be looking at a little bit She starts with a low ground wall Okay, that's interesting It is a PVT, so it's not really necessary, but it's completely playable. I'm not flaming this It's completely possible to get a low ground wall, a core before nexus, and just chrono and adapt across the map to deny your opponent's command center That is a fine opener Look at that This guy's even going to go at the correct time Well, almost the correct time So usually what I'd say for the cybercourt to go down, I'd say 124 is a good time 124, 125 the latest This went down at 131, but it is what it is You know, you can't always win and gets all the buildings down We're talking gold here, you know This is, we're not expecting the highest level We're not expecting a lot, to be honest Expectations are low. And yet I have a feeling that our good friend MSMG is going to be able to kind of dive under the bar that we already set at the lowest possible setting Second piling is coming down We have a chronobo boost on Whenever I see a chrono boost on Warpgate, I immediately get suspicious because I don't think in my long time of watching Iyotis replays that I've once seen a chrono boost on a warp gate that did anything, okay? Let me just remind everyone what a chrono boost actually does. A chrono boost decreases the amount of time in a resource, a research, or in a unit that is building by 10 seconds if it hits the full duration, which means that now a warp in will be 10 seconds faster This tends to be completely useless because most of the time you're not even going to have a second gateway unit yet So you're chrono boosting out warp gate for your single gateway, which makes very little sense Like you're just going to, you just want to warp in a single unit real fast Makes no sense to me Second gateway is going down This built, by the way, I'm going to be honest with you guys This looks a lot. Well, I'm not sure about the battery, but a lot like my Robotics Facility guide I'm not quite sure what it's called I think it's called Crazy Colossus or something like that Very similar build order here I'm not upset by it Okay Now we get to see what the Warp Gate research is Oh look at that This is just a thing of beauty Chrono boost the Warp Gate research, so it's done 10 seconds faster Then as the Warp Gate research finishes, he starts another Stalker So his first Warp Gate is actually going to morph, what, a solid 20 seconds after the Warp Gate finishes, or what, 15 seconds And thus the Chrono was completely useless. It's almost like I can predict what's going to happen in these games these days, because I've seen it so much I know exactly Okay, this is not my crazy Colossus guide Forged Twilight and Forgas Now we're talking I do like the observer position, by the way that's looking tight Okay, and so usually when you play Forge Twilight, what you want is you want a very heavy mineral army, because you're most likely going to be wanting salads Just going two-base blink stalker with plus one is not actually good So you probably want to get maybe like fast blink into charge, and thus you want a faster third base rather than getting more gases. Unless you're rushing storm or Robo Bay, you don't actually need to get four gases before your third base or maybe if you play Stargate So, yeah, okay Well, wait, no Why do I say okay? I wasn't expecting the charge, because the charge makes the least sense with this You'll see that the gas count is going to rise, and he said, aka sleepless in Seattle, which means he's American, which then again explains his affinity for having big amounts of gas that he doesn't really need Benchie's going to roll in here This indeed is very annoying Not the slowest response time Also wasn't a quick response time, but it wasn't the slowest either. We need to keep in mind that this is Gold League level and that both players are just going to be a little bit slower Super Battery could have been activated here Not quite the case, but that's okay Who could have predicted that the Benchy would fly back? If only we had a way to defend two bases at the same time by leaving his stalker over here rather than running like a I like that he did it again You know he didn't learn from his mistake the first two times, then did it a third time But luckily for him, the Terran decided not to fly back into the main base. Could have just kept ping-ponging in between the main and the natural again and again Now this Benji, technically we could react to it, but we could also just idle our units in our natural for a little bit longer That also makes a little sense This is the one, this is the most ambitious Benji that I've seen in my life You're like my friends, yeah, I know they went for workers, but me, I got a pilot and I started working on the gateway as well I got like 200, 200 shields of that gateway, all right? I did a good job This isn't even Mac I've been lied to? Did he No, okay, it's the correct thing He said T-Back He was talking about Amnita. Am I going wild in the head? Terran Mac is Inba dams the facts, homie He's playing bio! What? This guy has four barracks I completely forgot what we were looking at here What is this, by the way? way, there's another observer, another observer I wouldn't mind having an observer here for full vision, get a unit at the watchtower for some added vision on as well There's an awful small amount of things happening this game I have to admit, Robo Bay finally coming on. Okay, this is, I know that you said that you see build orders at guidelines, but this is more like that if it's said that the guideline is to eat five potatoes a day, then we'll What we kind of mean with that guideline is that it's fine to also eat four potatoes or six potatoes Okay What you do instead is you see you need to eat five potatoes a day and put an eggplant in your nose hole, you know? Like try to stuff them It doesn't make a lot of sense It's nothing to do with the guideline This is a completely different thing than anything I have ever seen and hopefully different than anything I will ever see in the future. This is a warning for everyone as well that is looking at this and thinks, oh, that's fun This looks like a builder This is not a builder What is this cannon doing? What is this cannon defending? If you're going to get harassed, it's going to come from here This cannon is defending, this population of fish In that case, that's a good cannon I'm going to let it be Okay, here you catch a drop ship You're very proud of that You started feeling good about yourself I actually can't believe that I'm looking at a game that is considered Mac Just because he builds two tanks, doesn't make it Mac This is bio He went for Stim. He should have combat shields on the way, yeah And he has four barracks And he's getting an armory Okay, maybe he's going to be going to some BioMack You hate to see it When's the last time you built a worker? There's one building here, so about five seconds ago Well, that question got answered quickly Very rapidly even Plus two, thermal lens as well Okay, I love the vision that you have I find it very impressive that you have five observers and still manage to miss this move out completely I feel like we could give you map and you'd still be out of position this entire time Oh, I mean you're gonna win this fight, that's for sure. The other guy just wasn't even seats with his tanks Okay A thousand gas in the bank, as predicted Who could have thought that taking four gases this fast with an army that doesn't require a lot of gas would get you to float a lot of gas? That really is wild, okay So you managed to take out a big portion of your opponent's army You decide, hey, I want to come out a lot of your opponent's army Hey, I want to counterattack now and do some damage I kind of feel like you should just win There's no reinforcements again So you're building a prism Now this is absolutely fantastic What is this? And why weren't they included? I want to see this again. This entire interaction, okay? So let's see He walks up here, sees a tank Yes, okay, he has full vision I keep forgetting he has full vision the entire time He just can't judge anything, but he actually has full vision What? I missed that earlier How did I miss that earlier? Some cannibalism going on Okay, so he sees everything that there is Get shelled by a tank and his opponent stims Then he's like, oh, that is way bigger than I saw just half a second ago Let me run back I see my opponent is going back to doing nothing Let me recall my army Great sequence This was a great sequence I wish there was a second part of this. I kind of want to see this again but no we can't just keep repeating the same thing over it's like the people that watch like a shrek 12 times it's like come on buddy you know that the ogre is gonna marry the princess now you don't need to watch it again people who do that why do you always watch the same movies don't you want to watch something new every now and then it's like the lifestyle of an 85 year old at that point it makes sense you know it's like you kind of want to watch that you know you enjoy it but when you're 12 or 13 why do kids like doing that. How does that make any sense? Kids should be the one that are constantly exploring new things They seem to be you know, I remember when I was a kid I watched Peter Pan like eight times It's not even that good of a movie It's not like you're finding new things with every watch Oh, thinkerbell's wearing a pink dress Like, yeah, no, like it's useless Okay, now we're going into this isn't Mac. This is a single factory units and because your opponent has so little bio unit it looks like Mac but this is not Mac how are you gonna lose this game though you have 2k gas now as Protos you have this structure called the Templar archives which allows you to throw away your gas into a unit that it's extremely good called the Arcone oh my god you have so many cannons the cannons will just be able to hold this won't they be let's say at your response time okay robotic facility okay you look at the cannons Pull away the workers Maybe super battery it? No, not necessary Okay, well, no super battery, but the rest, honestly, not too bad. I'm kind of okay with that The problem is that you have 1800 gas, you're not using it Your Ford base started at the 12-minute mark This is a good DT That's not really a run-by because it is on the sides, but it is a DT attack and I like that You know, I can dig it I can definitely dig it These 3 DTs, they did a buzzing job in job Go get some vision again There's no way you're gonna No, actually there is a way You have an 18 second warning, but there's no way you're looking at this observer and you're dealing with these drops Oh my god This is just like with the Benchie. Do you not understand that if there is a death space, you can fly over it and come out on the other side? It's not like it's a black hole where he goes in and he pops out I believe you don't actually pop out of black holes anymore and just dies No. that space can begin here and end here and then you can fly back and forth and you have vision of it again how you can how can you have this much vision and be so blind at the same time it's like you get too much stimulation or something like that you know if you know too much too many things happening at the same time see people that get over entertained you know watching a movie, refreshing their Instagram, talking with their sister on the phone at the same time Something like that That's what you do while playing StarCaves Just constantly looking around the things because you have so much vision Ooh, look at them, vicious. I'd also be kind of distracted if I saw these fishes Yeah, cool fishes Anyway, T-Back's moving forward and this indeed is a massive Mac army I can't believe that you thought this was Mac Like immortals are not the counter to this Well, immortal charge is fine, but I'd say Colossi or Disruptor Just your standard army would do even better You're lacking about what is this? Seven Arcons that could be in your army Let's not forget that Finally you're going to get vision of your opponent Five observers again Five observers and now you get vision Completely out of position So you need to run back By the time you arrive back home, you're already going to have lost your back. Yeah, this is actually the weirdest game I've seen in my life It actually is It just doesn't make any sense Just none of it made any sense Why is there DTs in your army? Why is there no Templar? Why didn't you morph these into Arcons? Why are you still almost winning this fight? Why did you reinforce with 4 DTs? Are you winning? No The answer is now Now your opponent is actually playing Mac Mac bio combination with a raven This is I actually have no clue what to say The weird thing is that I'm not even quite sure what you did wrong specifically Like it felt like you have some knowledge It seems like you have a brain as well. Okay, well now I'm not so sure what is this move? to run by through your opponent's army like basically what you're doing is you played something that resembled a build order for the first two and a half minutes then you went and did your own garbage it's like if you were in like one of these Bob Ross classes you know and you start by drawing one tree and then you just grab your paint bottle and you just squirt it all out over your paper you smash your face into it and then you start licking the paper, like a complete idiot I feel like that's kind of what I watched here. Like you started with the tree, okay? The happy little tree is what you started with And you end up licking your painting Which is not good for you, by the way This is bad for your help, this type of game If you play more than five games like this a week, I would recommend quitting I really would, because the amount of stress and frustration that you don't only give yourself, but other people that have to watch this hot piling heap of garbage is very, very high I was happy with that insult All right, well, you're dead It's time to leave, so we can get to the good part here G Now, I think this game deserved more than one G. Your opponent absolutely blasted you with the weirdest army comp, with the weirdest build I've seen in my life Quick look at the balance form What is they say? Mac is broken Okay, first of all, we're going to make three categories First is game knowledge Mac consists of units that mainly come from the factory This was bio with a factory to supplement into Biomech hybrid You get an F, a massive, huge suck And an F Two stamps for this one Your game knowledge is negative People that know nothing know more than you Second, your vision For your vision, you get a good Your vision was really good You had observers all over the map, almost the entire time You saw everything. I give you a good Then we have a bonus category using the vision For that, I don't even know what stamp to give you Freaking terrible, god-awful, the worst Kind of like the worst Pop, the worst Actually, the worst use of vision that I've ever seen in my life Then to end with, your unit composition, you are lacking arcons completely I don't mind the immortals as much, but if you have some arcons here for tanking, it's going to help so, so much Add a couple of zealots in as well Don't get DTs As a fighting army, a DT is 125 minerals, 125 gas Instead, what you can do is you spend that money on zealots and High Templar. And you morph the High Templar into Arcon That has really nice synergy You get a lot of zealots and you get a lot of Archons with that as well, rather than having to build these very expensive DTs that are really only good for harassing So on that, you're also going to get an extremely mediocre to atrocious stamp Congratulations, my friend Altogether, you suck All right That's going to be it for today's episode of Is It Inba or Do I Suck? Where once again we have someone who sucked If you think that you don't suck and that it is indeed imbalanced, be sure to submit a replay in the replay submitting form below Thanks everyone for watching I hope you had a great time. I didn't Bye-bye Like."

        "text": "Dear Harstam, I am here to tell you that my brain, it's dying every time I'm playing a TVP, but especially this one My opponent had no clue about my build order, taking massive damage from one Reaper at the start of the game, while behind I'm playing a fast TRIRCC build, but still this was aunt enough My oops were better, my economy was better My opponent, it, Stephen getting outplayed a couple of times and he was doing a mediocre job at splitting his army properly But once Tos gets into late game and they're getting a massive number of disruptors and blink DTs, you can't do anything anymore. My conclusion is that TvP is unplayable as a Terran, but maybe I am wrong. So what do you think? Lord has them. Is it Imba or do I suck? Nice. Kuku send this to me. Kuku is a prodigy Terran player Playing for Team Rotti. I just dropped to the chair. He's about 5-7-58K MMR. He's one of the up and coming young boys that we have on the ladder currently. Like I said, recruited by Team Rotti. Very solid player. And his opponent is going to be someone we are all very well, very familiar with. It is the cowboy, also known as Harston. It's a me. So this is a game that I'm I played against Kuku. He sent me this replay, I believe, a week or so after this game was played And right now we're about two weeks after that again, because I kind of forgot about this Then I opened up my Discord and I remembered this message And I was like, hey, let's have a look at that So here we are Kuku, a pretty decent Grandmaster player I want to say somewhere around rank 100, rank 80 I actually don't know Maybe it's rank 70 or 50 I'm sorry if I said too low of a rank Kuku I know you're a fantastic player But we're going to be having a look exactly at what he does. I can't remember this game at all, so it's also going to be a nice trip down memory lane I assume that I win this game, not only because I'm a fantastic player, but also because he submitted his replay complaining about Protos Even though I wouldn't put it past most Terrans to complain about the matchup after winning, I have seen it happen I've had Terrence complain that they didn't win hard enough because ProDos is so imbalanced This is the type of stuff that only Terrans come up with Zirks are happy to win anything Proes are happy to win anything But for Terrans, they need to win in a dominating fashion If the game is even slightly close, that might indicate an imbalance. Okay? This Prodol's player is a little bit slow on the head It's going to lose his pro to the Marine here See, it's not too happy with it Happs to the best body Don't worry about it We have a single worker here, mining gas Okay, single worker here mining gas. so that tends to indicate that we're going to be working with a triple cc which is also what he said in his imbalance form i said i'll remember that he said don't forigate me please i said i won't and he said thanks there's some high-level dialogue um this this could be a hollywood movie with this level of dialogue this could be a ben stiller movie except i don't look quite as good as ben stiller and but i'm also not funny so still could be a Ben Stiller movie Okay, I opened up with Stargate and I didn't chronobo boost my second adept I am kind of an idiot sometimes I might not That actually is really dumb I'm not a big fan of that. All right Reaper pops in Yeah, I'm going to take some damage from this Reaper That much is obvious So, even said that, I took big damage from the Reaper I can't remember this at all I always chronoboose my second adapt I bet I was telling a great story at the same time to my stream or something like that This Reaper's going to get what? Kills Come on, this isn't big damage, this is two kills Oh, fuck That's messed up You can't say big damage when you get two kills with a Reaper That's okay damage Like it's like it's like a mule not working Immediately sends it into the main base though I really like that. Rather than losing mining time and keeping it over here, he says, okay, I'm just going to send my mule and my two extra SUV straight into the main base and I'm going to be fine with that I like that response a lot That's a really cool response cuckoo That's cool That's definitely a cool thing to do What else do we see here? We have a Phoenix being built for the cowboy We have two adepts moving in as well Two adepts Oh, they're gonna finish up Am I also going to do big damage here? Well, it doesn't quite seem to be the case I think I'm gonna be able to kill what? Two marines? Maybe escape with two adapts or with one adept. It's an okay trade It's like one adept against two marines I think if you're playing Stargate, that's actually a slightly better trade for Protos, but it's not going to end the game most likely Mainly if you play Oracle, trading out Marines against Adapts is a good thing, because then he has less Marines to defend the Oracle, right? But because I'm playing Phoenix, it's a little bit less of a big deal Third Bay is going to be going down here, and this is all of a One Gate So this looks like it's going to be forged Twilight for me, rather than Robo, maybe Twilight into But once I see the third base, I think I throw down a Robo as well. It's kind of cool I can't remember the game very well, but I can kind of predict what I'm going to do just based on how I know I think Okay, we immediately see a robo I'm surprised we don't straightaway see a forge and a second gate Okay, a second gate is here and forge also should be going down soon I think I'm not sure if I want to cut phoenixes here Ooh Now, this is actually big damage All right, Cuckoo, let me explain something to you Let me explain something to you A mew, a freshly landed mew will mine as much as I believe 3 54 workers or something like that 3 5 workers, I always say. So, I just practically killed 7 workers, at least for the duration of the mule During that time, you're going to have 7 workers less income That is big damage, okay? And I didn't even lose a phoenix for that You had to lose the Reaper to kill two workers Sure, that damage was permanent, but you also lost the Reaper And you always kind of kill one worker with the Reaper if you're going to sacrifice it So really, you only killed one extra work I'm not expected to get to Phoenix Look how upset you are Nice Nice Okay, so I scouted basically everything Here, wait Didn't he, what did he say? My ups, splitting My opponent had no clue about my build order. What do you mean I had no clue about your build order? Okay, let's, let's just go back The first time I scout At this, I just, I scout At this, I was, I was, I was a little bit At this, I was, I, you mean, I had no clue about your build order And what you mean? And I, I had no clue about your build order Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay. Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Okay Let's just go back the first time I scout At this point, I have no clue about your build order, but it's not because of a lack of scouting That's just because I cannot know That's like me saying, right now my opponent has no clue, how many workers I have in my natural It's like it's completely irrelevant because I don't have to respond to anything yet. Like there's no threat coming to me right now, and there can't be because I understand how the game works It's like me pausing the game and asking you, hey, what currently is my work account and you're not answering the questions and then me writing an imba forming like my opponent didn't even have a clue how many workers I had What an idiot It's like it's irrelevant how many workers I have It doesn't matter because I can't do anything even if you would have told me at this but I would have been able to do something with that information but I can't It's not possible to get that information earlier I saved up two phoenixes. Perhaps I could have gone a bit faster but I wanted to catch something And then I decided, you know what, I'm just going to go for a scout I see three barracks I see the amount of Marines And I notice immediately, okay, this is absolutely no problem for me I'm not building a battery So I realize this is triple C I am not overreacting, thinking this is some type of three wrecks I see the three racks And I immediately realize, okay, I know what this is now Like, I'm not taking any weird safety measures, any big prevent Okay, I do get a battery here I guess a little bit bad I take back everything I said in the past 25 seconds. Maybe I didn't quite understand what I was going I built two batteries Okay, that's actually kind of embarrassing I scout it now, though Do I cancel? You know what? Is that even that bad though? Because very often, beyond when he would play this build, he would still walk across the map with Marines, with Stim, and then he tried to do damage I think a battery is fine against this I take back that I took it back I put it back out there Everything I said in the past 50 seconds, except when I said that I would take it back, has been untaken back So it has been the truth I play the Uno Reverse card Second game, I don't like this, actually. This should have been a Forge This is a Twilight and then a Robo Bay Come on, Kevin Get it What am I doing? Oh, okay, I remember now This is when I watch Showtime play Charge into Robo Bay. with phoenixes i thought it was so cool and no matter what was going to happen i would have played this so i'm not completely responding to everything but i'm responding a little bit all right a little little bit of a response i'm okay with that a little bit of a response you know sometimes you just got to test some stuff out and yeah i'm happy with it what is these two barracks i feel like this is a weird timing for barracks and i find it a weird location as well i'm also not sure about the single ebay but i don't mind it i like when terence nah i think single ebay is actually fine in this situation because you got it so fast. So then you get a nice push with plus one combat shield, high marine count It's actually really good against big Phoenix builds And because my colossi is actually pretty late, I kind of like his position for an initial push that he could potentially execute He hadn't really made any major mistakes, except for losing the two mules where he wasn't really in position He's hunting for Phoenix's finds of Phoenix Honestly, he's in an okay spot The only thing that I do have a little bit of an issue with is with the fact that, oh, I get another mule, that's really nice. he's floating a little bit of money at times where it isn't quite necessary as you see that i'm also floating some money but i'm a protos player so it's allowed because i'm waiting for my warpins so you see the moment i warp in i kind of spend it automatically you really do have to be careful here because it just means that you're not producing properly or you're getting supply block i'm not quite sure what the case was here but it there is no way for tarrant to quickly invest resources into something um if your infrastructure is too late yeah this is actually a pretty painful supply block He needs the depot drop and gets another depot immediately He already had two depot drops. That's two strikes already, all right? That's dangerous Has to build three depots after he depot dropped That is the anticipation level of a duck when he's eating all the bread being thrown at him Oh, more bread That's delicious Idiots The fact that ducks managed to survive makes me doubt evolution Where were we? Five depots being built after after a depot drop, okay? This is kind of messed up I'm not going to lie It's really kind of messed up I don't think that is cool This is Nice move, Kevin Yes, baby Pick him up Get him a router for free Nice Phoenixes are brilliant Observer, also beautiful position Now, I could say. I was going to say, you should scan this, but I'm not going to blame you for it if you don't But you found it So I'm going to give you credits for that You did a good job there Yeah You did a good job there So far, except for the massive supply block, I'm honestly, like, nothing really has happened, except that I feel like your push is just late It doesn't have that many units I guess the supply block, and it kind of does help with that You go into plus one, and then what is your follow-up here? So there's a couple of things you can do to follow-up, and all of these are valid follow-ups. So what you can do right now is you could throw down a fourth base, do a 1-1 push, and get a second tech structure So like Ghost Academy, Fort Base, or you could get Second Starport, Fort Base Or what you could be doing is you get eBay Armory, Fort Base, and you go into heavier upgrades and you stay on the map for a long time with two armies These are all valid options I'm just laying out the options right now It's playing Fort Tech Lab, by the way Which is kind of rare Most of the time against Phoenix openers, you have these Terran players that really like to open up with a heavy Marine Force for the first two Metafax. and then after the first two Maddofx have hit, that's when they start sprinkling in marauders because they know that that's when the Colossi most of the time are going to come out This was a really good trade for him and really poorly done by the Protos player Protos in general in this game is a little bit in trouble actually He's going to give up one unit I am going to give up one unit Speaking of third person is really odd I'm having a very difficult time to get any type of map vision, honestly, over here Nice Send in a hallucination to tank the mine shot and tank it with your main dude Alrighty, it's that time again. Today it's time for the very best of the very worst Welcome to Bronze League Heroes Absolutely fantastic I think I'm going to go for a push now or something like that Second Robo going down I kind of like the way this toss is playing I don't mind it at all Good vision as well out of the toss Okay, so this is the plan here. He's going to be going for double eBay armory, Ghost Academy and a Fort base it's a little bit too much at the same time i think i believe you're going to need a sixth gas for this no in order to afford this you can start 2-2 and your ghost upgrades and ghost another supply block by the way it's a little bit painful do we have another supply drop as well no i'm keeping tabs on you buddy you're not getting away with any supply drops this game that i can ensure you you're just lacking gas no i think you're going to be lacking some gas it's floating a lot of money as well why you're not producing anything out of a lot of structures that's actually kind of bad like you I always like to translate units into supply and a thousand minerals that is 20 Marines 20 times 50 20 supply of Marines so you know you could be at 180 supply to be fair would only be Marines but you can some eroters in there as well which can be kind of useful you also could have already started your extra three barracks if you want to be going into that or your second starport whatever it is you want to be doing i think if you open with ghost double ebay i'd say probably want to be going into that eight racks first right um instead you decide to drop here do get the plus two this is a nice drop and the phil phoenixes are going to get at least one of holy crap this provost is a little bit of an idiot does end up getting the matter of fact though so it's not the end of the world salad's run by doesn't achieve much prism stays alive now a little bit of a supply block here for the prolos after his piling got killed on the right side ford base is about to finish up and now yeah you're you're lacking the gas buddy you can't afford this with five gas I think like he's going to be getting a so so basically the way I tend to this is your first real structure as a terran okay this costs a lot of gas This costs a lot of gas to get ghost out, to get the enhanced shockwave. And then this is also going to cost a lot of gas These upgrades cost a lot of gas So doing all of that at the same time, while in five gas, is extremely unrealistic You're going to have to cut something, and I'm afraid it's going to be the enhanced shockwave You've been cutting a lot of air units already as well Let's not forget we're 10 minutes in game You've lost three MEDFX, and you only have six air units out I think your first two MED of X finished at the 7 9 minute mark Is that correct? Then you produce two every 30 seconds, which means you could have had 14 air units out if you had the money to continuously produce. Right now you have nine out So I wouldn't have minded if there was three extra air units out, something like that Would have probably been good Second starboard. In that case, you also don't need such a fast second star port or you could get the a dregs first i still think in general the a dregs wouldn't have been bad if you're floating one k the entire time but there's just a lot of decisions where i'm not sure what is exactly best or what the complete correct order is but i really do believe a couple of extra barracks wouldn't hurt at this point especially because you're floating money like there's no shame in doing that you know even if sure you are grandmaster and you're supposed to be able to spend your money probably on this this is a good response by the way pull the workers away immediately while you're dealing with this crap that's really nice I'm a little bit weak here as well like you should you should be looking maybe to do something there could have maybe chased but it's tricky as well one disruptor shows up you lose your entire army that is something that that can be difficult to deal with so a nice pickup I thought he had Vikings as well though yeah these these bad boys probably should have been sent there a while ago to deal with that prism they will be going there right Now, your Ford base doesn't really have a lot of workers. I feel like you haven't been producing workers as well. I have to admit that your map vision ever since you kind of have been pushed back has completely decreased. And this is one of the things that I think sets good Terrans apart from fantastic Terrans. Is that fantastic Terrans always find a way back on the map to either get that map control or to deny their opponent's map vision. And very often these two things go hand in hand. This is an extremely risky drop and I'd even consider it stupid. Like this makes very little sense if you don't know if I have this Sensor Tower. I didn't have this Sensor Tower. Yeah, so okay, but this is fine. If you do it like this, it's actually fine You're going to be going here The problem is you have no vision on any other side My army could have been here and you wouldn't have known You need to send out more marines to check towers, to check the middle area, maybe even something here And then you can do things like that Or you need to make an opening with a small harassment group And once you have that opening and you force defense, So imagine you have two drops all the way going around here, going over here, walking into this place Then you see me making a defensive reaction Maybe your other army can start walking over here. But until, like, sending out such a big chunk of your army is just really risky, especially because your planetary isn't even done yet Like, you really had no clue where my army was or what was happening The only thing you knew is that there was a zealot here It is kind of scary, I have to admit It is kind of scary to more move out like this Two drops I would have been happier with I really would have been Because that also allows you if my army would have been coming from here, for example, to have another army going here, then maybe you can force a base trade if you can't defend. So a lot of the movement, I'm not the biggest fan of Do you like these two Vikings there? I wouldn't mind if it's a single Viking You're going to pull them back That's annoying, but yeah, it's not the end of the world And hence, shockwave, still not here You're still kind of lacking gas, which really is kind of showing in your lack of air units Another thing that I want to really put some attention on this is the fact that the way that it works for most Terrans, or the way that most Terrans see the game, is that against non-colossi, or non-colossi, you can survive with bio plus ghost, or just bio plus mine kind of wins that. On Stamplers are out, you need ghost, but if it's just Charged Lot Arcon, Immortal or something, like you can with bio, marauder, marine, most of it, you're going to be fine If you have a couple of minds, ghost will make you win that fight way harder Once Colossi come out, you can survive with Ghost, but you want to start transitioning into Vikings Okay? So you can, like you can fight against Colossi with a max marauder ghost army, but it's difficult to win a fight unless you're in a very good position You can most of the time just defend Attacking into positions is difficult. With Vikings, without having a good position, if you have the correct amount of Vikings against the Colossi army, you will win the fight Guaranteed You hit the EMPs, you hit with your Vikings, you're going to be fine Once disruptors are out, most terrorists like the transition into Liberators, liberators with range Now, you might be wondering, why are you laying out the entire history of the PVT matchup? It's because you need to be anticipating these moves Liberators gain a lot from ship weapons upgrades So even though right now you might not be thinking about disruptors yet or you haven't even seen them yet, this might be your first time, you probably already should have been getting them. You have a lot of minerals in the bank You should have been mining more gas in order to afford those ship weapon upgrades and perhaps even start considering throwing down a fusion core Anticipation is key in this matchup You always want to be a tech switch ahead of your opponent Right now, even though you had a good position in this game, you've just been tech switches behind You're still trying to pump out Vikings, well, I'm already transitioning out of Colossi because I'm believing that you should already have the units ready I'm going into this Rupter You don't even have liberators on the way yet This is a fantastic move Or a fantastic move This is a fantastic situation for you. I didn't like how the move came to be But I think the fact that it's here now is very good for you I really do believe that And it also forces me back It's absolutely fantastic Good job You know, even though I'm not the greatest fan of how it happened, it happened, and you used it well You also realized, okay, recall called Now you move on the map with your second army, but we're seeing an issue here, all of a sudden, aren't we? You're lacking metaphics Your army is extremely bruised All of these medevacs are empty, not because you're over stimmed necessarily, even though you might have been a little bit too trigger happy with the stims at times. I've been paying attention to that But because you're lacking air units We're 12 minutes into the game You have lost total four air units, and you're still only on 10 air units, six metaphics for Vikings You've been in double Starport, but I don't think I've seen a single time where both of these star ports were producing The fact of the matter is you've just been lacking gas for a very long time in this game, and now even though you aren't, you're still not really producing from that You're getting your three extra barracks after your fifth base finished while you're starting your sixth base. You're just lacking production for bio units, and you were lacking production for your starport units because you didn't have enough gas. Sorry for that guy, some dogs started going, absolutely bananas in the background we'll have to have a talk with him later tonight all right this is a good move but the problem is it's not going to be a great move because this army is already so damaged so you're never going to be able to really get done what you want like this drop would have been really really sick jesus christ this guy's actually an idiot come on buddy this drop would have been really really sick had it not been that most of these units are already really bruised and you can't heal them up oh this is the f2 of a lifetime as well look that as a thing of beauty upgrade finishes nice good job Kevin we have a drop here as well I don't actually like this type of dropping I on do I understand why are you doing it no not really another stim yeah and we're losing even more meta effects and now because you're losing these meta facts you need to reproduce more meta facts and you're still not getting into the zone where you need to be and that is liberators you should already be having a decent Viking count Like I could switch back into three, four colossi at this point, and it would be really bad for you. You're lucky that I didn't because, well, as we real, the brain on this protocol isn't the brightest, but you had a good position, and now you kind of lost that good position You, within about 20 seconds, look at this So right now, look at the position we're currently in, okay, you're in a position where you have complete map control, you're going to be up You can be up a base by getting this one And you should probably already be, well, first of all, three, three upgrades maybe, getting some extra liberators, things like that And you can do that because you have map control, okay? I can't move out until I have cannons and batteries up here. And I want to be taking a fifth base So it's going to be very expensive for me to do that I don't have that many work I don't have that much income I can't really do that So if you just keep this army on the map, you can transition into an army that you need Unless you have 100% sure damage, there's no reason for you to do this You're giving up your map control with this and you're giving up very, very important metaphics as well Both of these things at the same time, giving up map control and your air units That's a mistake, my friend That really is a mistake Okay, let's skip through We already saw this So this gets semi-cleaned up. Yep, that does get cleaned up This gets cleaned up What else do we have here? Now I start moving out Now all of a sudden I have map control and this would be okay if you already had the units ready to deal with disruptors Sadly for you, you haven't even considered building a single Liberator yet You have zero ship weapon upgrades I'm going to be getting blink DTs at this point because I'm getting ready for the next step Once Terrans have liberators, it tends to be nice to do I get that shot off? No way, right? That was really close It tends to be nice to get blink DT so you can snipe planetaries. And in that case, Terrans just need to defend properly and then if they can force a fight it can still be good for them Now you don't really have anything to chase that already tends to not be possible against disruptors So I would not recommend doing that, especially not against eight disruptors With the army you currently have, I would say the only thing you can really do is either go for base trades, try to get map control back, basically, or, well, actually, there's no or You can't chase this army You need to force base trades And ideally, with a couple of liberators here to hold positions, but you don't have that. You haven't taken your fifth base yet, which you probably should have had a while you had map control Now all of a sudden you don't have map control anymore So, well, yeah, you can't take your fifth base no more, even though this base tried is best And now, yeah, you're just going to be stuck defending positions that you don't even want to be in Like, you're pretending like I'm a 5 3K Protos idiot You're trying to snipe disruptors from the back with an entire army, stimming while you have four Madovacs Like, welcome to the Big Boy League, man This don't work no more, all right? What you need to do is you need to start base trading like your life depends on it. Get a sense of reality, okay? I don't lose against a flank It's not going to happen, okay? More than one thing needs to be happening for that to happen And it won't Because I know what these babies are worth Okay Okay, this is not the cleanest Boom Boom Yeah You flank This is what happens You were already in a bad position, but you can still make something better out of a bad position This is kind of if you have like, okay, imagine you want to cook a nice arabatia, arabia, arabia pasta Okay delicious pasta, except there's a problem You don't have any peppers, you don't have tomatoes, and you're lacking the pasta. Really, all you have is water and a little bit of salt and olive oil Now, what you are doing right now is you're pouring the boiling water over yourself and spraying the olive oil into your own ice, and then you're confused that it didn't taste good. obviously it didn't taste good you didn't even try eating it okay what you should be doing is you should be making olive oil salt water and drink some of that stuff and in that case it would have been base trading far-fetched analogy but I think it lands I do think it lands at this point let's be real you're pretty dead okay you tried well you had a big lead but you didn't manage to leverage it okay that's just the way it is you had momentum at times but you didn't push it You didn't keep map control You couldn't control the pace of the game The other player was faster than you. He was brighter, and that's a low bar to cross, my friend, because I know this guy a little bit He's not the brightest man in the world He's not the brightest man in the world Fifth base going down right now for this protos Your fifth base tries to go down I hope I actually get this Yeah, yeah, nice Nice That is nice I mean, you're completely dead We can talk long about it We can talk short about it We could talk about it for a couple of days, but there's absolutely This was a nice move, okay? You should have been doing this rather than trying to flank my nine disruptors with your tiny bio army. She's with two metaphax over here, boom, four through the middle, bang, a Liberator queued up on my third base, another Liberator here Like, I don't have that many cannons in defensive positions for Liberators That could have created some chaos, but instead you went for the sure play of losing, you know? Sure, the chance was low, but yeah, you made it zero I gave you maybe 15 to 20% And you were like, no, let me show you what I can do with that 20% Boom, threw it down the drain Out of this world, my friend Out of this world You're dead You're dead It's just the way to it Gigi You're a good man, though You juggied I appreciate your work ethic. I think you're a good man, good kid You know, I think you're absolutely fantastic, but this game, you know, we'll judge you on a couple of things First of all, leveraging situations or keeping good situations Having an advantage tends to be, it is possible for everyone, okay? I can get an advantage in a game against Cyril The problem is, I can't turn that advantage into a win, or I can't keep that advantage You had the same problem here Every single time you had an advantage, it felt like you got so nervous that you just threw it out of the window It's like playing a game of hot potato. Instead of a hot potato, you got like a massive bag filled with dollars and you're like, oh, this is annoying Throw it out You had the chance and you threw it out When you have control of the game, you play out the game as it already was intended to be So what I mean with this is if you have a plan that you start with and your plan is to win the game with liberators or with a one-one push and you get an early game advent try, the only thing that happens to your plan is that your plan just got better because your opponent's plan got worse His defense, by definition, got worse. So if your plan already was good, now it's even better So try to stick to that plan That way you also have an easy way to evaluate whether that plan works or not, rather than just doing random things Now every single time you got an advantage by playing well and playing proper, you decided to send four medevacs in here, three in here and be like, ooh-hoo! Let's see if I can accidentally with a game Like, that is after Sarah loses his first two links against me because I found them with my adept I just pull all my work and just aim off across the map, then get upset when I don't win No, you still need to play out the game properly. Just because you get an advantage doesn't mean you're entitled to win the game. That's number one. Number two is your control. Your control is not bad, but you seem at times a little bit naive in the, in the, it's a little bit It's a in that you believe that your opponents are all idiots. And now, I can't blame you to think that your opponent is a bit of an idiot if you're playing against a cowboy. But I think I am good enough where I'm not going to get flanked by a massive Marauder army. You need to realize where your chances are in a game, and you didn't realize that. Trying to flank a 9-Disruptor army is just no use. Just go for a base rate, really This is genuine advice I care about, no, just kidding you should do base trade It's good advice Do base trade It's your best opportunity very often If your opponent just has a way bigger army, don't go for the sure play If the sure play is a loss, then go for the risky play If you're winning, go for the sure play If you're losing, yeah, go for the risky play, of course And then finally, I do want to say something about your map vision I think at times your map vision, not only that, but also the map vision that you allowed the opponent to have was a little bit too much. you were very often in such a good spot and in a place where you had a little momentum which tends to be the case against Phoenix Colossi where Protos plays very defensive Terran can establish a network of vision of having watchtowers, making sure they have two armies on each side of the map It's very difficult for Protos to defend these bases and to get any type of vision and to walk across the map When TOS gets to walk across the map, they tend to be in a good place because the Toss army tends to work around timings like I was talking about earlier You have that Phoenix colossite timing. If you don't have enough Vikings, you could just die because you don't have the correct units So, yeah, you're lacking vision I think you played a good game You got a nice advantage at times, and there were some good moves in there, but altogether, my friend, this had nothing to do with imbalance This had more to do with you sucking Would you playing a little bit atrocious? With you being a little bit bad? Yes, you suck All right That's going to be it for today's episode of is it imba or do i suck thanks so much for kuku for sending in the replay much appreciated and i'll see you all next time for a new video tomorrow bye bye."

        "text": "Dear Harsdom, I think we can both agree that Zirk is completely broken race, in the sense that it can always make a kill move by making a big amount of the same units that are difficult to deal with until you can get your own answer, like Ghost for Hive It's also a race that arguably has too good recovery abilities, as it is difficult to always know whether Zirc makes mass drones or some units too It is in my opinion always a gamble for Taryn Most Terrans are either too afraid to go or too peaceful. While Clem is able to beat speed bailings on creep, most people just can do that because it's too difficult to think at the same time for the strategy aspect Wait what? Most Terrans are either too afraid to go or too peaceful While Clem is able to beat speed bailings on creep, most people just can't do that because it's difficult to think at the same time for the strategy aspect This guy, while he should be targeting down bailings, actually is thinking about the grand strategy I hope he never gets into a fist fight He'll be thinking about what he wants to cook in the evening. He's like, oh, I can't punch my opponent because I'm not quite sure if I want to eat spinach or beans tonight Pros can do it automatically, but we amateur players don't have the time to get those reflexes I feel like this game I had arguably played a better game than a lot of people in Diamond, maybe even Grandmasters Until the Luce of Benches All right, we're going to plan the flag here until the loose of the Benchies, he thinks he played a game better than a lot of people in Diamond, maybe even Grandmasters I think I expanded too slowly Well, I had a fifth, but didn't move until a lot Maybe it's the main reason that I lost, question mark. Anyway, good luck, Captain You'll need a lot of creativity to tell me I didn't play higher than Diamond and losing because Terran is the hardest race objectively And then he has an emoji that looks like this His name is Napoliton, Diamond Player, 4,000 MMR on EU Let's just hop into the replay hamster Let's just do that for once in our life All right, what do we have here? The map is Oxide, and that's actually really nice, because I have a game that I very often reference is the game Clam versus Rainer on Oxide I think it was one three McMasters ago They played on this map, and Clem spawned in the exact same position as Napoliton, and also played a Benchie opener. So if they played a similar opener, we can actually nicely check the difference between Napoliton and between Clem in those games Isn't that fantastic? The only difference here is that rather than playing against Rainer, Napoliton is playing against Nintendo So it makes it a little bit easier, but he said until he loses the Benchies, he basically played like a Grandmaster Well, at least that's what I got out of that sentence We're going to have a look That means that for the first part where he didn't lose the benches yet, we will be very, very rough on him And any mistake is going to get called out. After that, we can drop our level a little bit to diamond, but until then we'll treat him like he's clam, basically Send out a very quick SEV scout that is unnecessary in TVZ Scouting after barracks is completely fine It is safe It will get you all the information that you could ever need in time So you just waste a little bit of money It's not a massive deal, but if you're trying to be a grandmaster, then it is something that does matter The Reaper starts immediately That's good Orbital command starts immediately Well, I can turn on the music No, I don't want that I lied. We have a pool going down for the Zirk, and it's slowly but surely mining a little bit of gas here. and then we'll take a look at this Reaper Micro as well of course we all know that one of the main things that top Grandmasters do very well is microing and on top of that while they're microing they're also spending their money this is usually at the lower level it becomes more of a decision it's whether you micro or whether you macro correctly at the high level they manage to do both majority of the time I have a feeling that we might just get one of these cases where neither is being done but we'll see all right factory going down immediately wait what there's a reaper okay yeah there's a repair factory this all looks normal perfectly standard no second gas yet so the builder looks good the control on the reaper honestly is quite good as well i like that it's gonna get a drone for free this is good control you know what i don't think clem actually got a drone against reiner so this this actually has been pretty decent control um you're not floating any money because this is the money that will go into your third base right now yep goes down perfectly on time and as well, your reactor is on time. This actually looks like a very tight opener You've done a very good job so far I want to say I'm proud of you, but it doesn't mean much yet Well, in general, I'm not sure if that's your goal in life Me saying that I'm proud of you Starport should go down ASAP as well There's two ways you can do this You can either go Starport before Helions In that case, you also need a second gas right now Oh, there we go Gets it on luck This is a good start. Now, perhaps you could be doing a little bit more, trying to get a tumor but this is a map with a ramp so just attacking the third base or ideally what you be doing is just patrolling this area in that case links can't go past because right now these links manage to go past um if he would have been a bit faster the zirk that is might have been able to snipe like a mule or something so that could be a little bit painful so far you're actually doing a fantastic job at executing the build order um it does look really clean i'm going to have to admit control the hell in the hellins is not bad either and we're going to have to see a couple of extra cars. Nice Very solid start I'm happy with that Go immediately into the gas as well Where is that Reaper of yours? Oh Well, while this is what's happening, the Reaper died That is a pretty decently sized mistake because now it becomes very tricky for you to move out with these two Helions Bailing nest going down on the other side, not sure why, as well as a first banshee on your side So, so far I'm pretty happy with everything you have done You start your cloak as well. passive with the halions but you're focusing a lot on the macro and you don't really have map control so yeah I I don't mind it that much I don't mind it that much here comes to move out though okay I love to see it let's see what you're gonna double deepos going on I'd like to see what this Benji is gonna do are you gonna send it across the map this is perfect this is perfect this can this can fly over here oh you can also go like this yeah this is better sorry yeah this actually is Perfect You need to build one here Get a tech lab on this barracks. I was thinking it could fly on the reactor, but that's not actually how it works I made a mistake there My bad It's going to be going for a quick stim as well Continuous, well, almost continuous worker production The control on the heliness perhaps isn't all that This hasn't been spotted yet by the creep tumor So far, I'm not saying it is as clean as clam, but it's pretty darn close This guy is not playing a poor game whatsoever, Napolitan Now, he hasn't really controlled his halions once and no damage really has been done We haven't seen a single rotation The bench he has been shown as well at this point. As now this barracks is going to go over here and you have three barracks pumping marines already Gonna swap this What are we doing here? Oh, quick scan Tries to jump for a creep tumor Isn't quite going to work So far, I'd actually say it's pretty darn close to, well, not perfect but it actually has a really good start Barracks too I'm very impressed I was going to make massive amounts of fun of you, but this is good This really isn't bad, honestly The only problem is, I guess, is that you've built a lot of units that are meant to harass, and you haven't really harassed yet, right? You've killed, well, nothing, a single worker, and that was with your Reaper. So I guess that's a bit of an issue Now here come the Benchie Let's see if that changes anything Let's get let's just get the first person view here from you You're controlling the Benchie You're killing workers, killing workers, killing workers Oh, building a couple more depot, two depots You are slightly supply blocked here at 85 You're not building any marines because you are supply blocked Your metaphics can start because you're supply blocked You're getting some damage This is not the cleanest micro either You missed a couple of shots already The control is a little bit sloppy You go from supply block, I think straight into another supply block here Yeah, you were only building a single depot. So now 93 out of 93 Still only building three Marines You did do quite some damage, though, with these two banshees, so that is nice You should also be moving out at this point I believe the timing that you want to hit is 648, with like 16 Marines and two metaphaks You have 11 Marines, no METAX, and you're not on the other side of the map Your combat shield hasn't started yet Your MataVX are still 15 seconds away, so you're already pretty late So yeah, you're just going to be, like you're floating I don't think you've macroed once properly ever since you started controlling the Venshes, and you're, are you going to lose this? I guess not Oh, never mind. You did lose it Okay So 709, you have 92-7 supply out of 125 Your 1-1 is almost done and you have 16 Marines For reference, let me actually quickly check what Klam has at a time like this All right, I quickly watched the VOD and Klam had 121 supply, so that's about 30 supply more, and he already lost a bunch of units, and he was doing a hellbat push on the other side of the map So, the claim that you were as good as a Grandmaster, you might still be as good as a very low-tier Grandmaster, but down 30 supply really is a lot at seven minutes And you were floating 800 And maybe Clem lost something before as well. And your push was, well, it hasn't even left yet I know this build because I play this myself Usually at the latest, you're supposed to hit like 645 or so, something like that, after double Benchy six car So you're going to be hitting about a minute late, I guess? Well, more than a minute late You're also going to hit with slightly more But, I mean, your timing is off We also forgot your combat shield for quite some time However, you're still in a good spot I still think your early game I actually agree with you I think your early game was better than a lot of diamonds At least it was better than what your opponent did You killed some workers. You're now up 10 workers, which if you're a terran player, you should know how good this is This I'm not the greatest fan of Walking on creep unseached We'll see what happens You're up 30 supply and after this you're up 10 supply? So, yeah, you lost about a 20 supply lead there in three seconds If you're up 11 workers, you're getting faster upgrades than your opponent, and you have tanks, there's no reason to rush up creep You rush up creep if he just killed 45 workers and this is your final desperation push You were far ahead You could take it slow You could siege a tank here siege your tank here, kill some creep, pre-spread your Marines, all of that good jazz. You could have even dropped two of your medevacs here and left both of your tanks at home for defense Lots of options here You went for the worst option and you lost a creptone of units I still think that you're going to be up No, actually, your downing resources lost at this point as well, which is impressive Once again, you just move forward with your splash units You're going to lose, you're not going to lose it, but I think you could have lost it Very sloppy Once again, just running on creep Running on creep like there's no possibility of there being banings Oh, that was a good drag That was a really nice control out of the circle, honestly. I think you just managed to snip a banning there, which is also good It's not a bad game You should really scan for this creep though, buddy You just Why'd you just keep moving forward? That can't be it Because now the creep isn't really disappearing It's really easy to deny creep spread, especially if your opponent isn't really actively spreading creep You just kill the active tumors and you just keep going there again and again Can you go for a Liberator? There's no Fort Base yet, by the way, which worries me Oh, no, there is You build it in the back In that case, that doesn't worry me It is a little bit late, and usually you'd build it over here. It's safe there and can fly to your Fort Base location pretty easily You have a second factory as Yeah, second factory? Drilling claws And you're going into Barracks 6, 7, and 8 Okay, so far, you are someone that I guess you stole this build order Like, you copied it and you copied it pretty well All the ideas behind it so far has been good Like, you actually have been doing a pretty decent job, I want to say You're getting all the correct buildings You're getting them at almost the correct time The problem just so far has been your move-outs You just actually move command on creep And then I'm surprised that you get destroyed by banlings It's like, this. This is literally the only thing Zirk has against Taryn is banlings on creep If there's no creep, bainlings really suck Here you go again You just walk Now you stim? This is like trying to stand into a landmine to attack it Well you also have perfectly long-range weapons to make sure that that landmine detonates from a distance Now you rotate towards this side I don't mind that too much You really need to kind of leapfrog forward with your splash, whether that's your mines or your other things It's nothing worse splits It's just you only had three mines here and one of them didn't burrow It's only two mines shot You're going to get cleaned up by Ling Bain and a single swarm host. That's a classic You haven't done a single drop yet on the far right side Your opponent is moving in one big ball You're moving in one big ball pretty decently sized army at home again it feels like you're just sending in a big army then you lose your entire army and your Medivac count keeps growing with that army oh there comes a Widow Mine drop a single Widow Mine up no oh three Widow Mines but why this one this one wasn't allowed what's wrong with him look this drop and cap them he smiles all right and then everyone else but him gets picked? What is this? This is ridiculous He actually is leaving me Look at him all his friends in the Medivac Poor guy. Well, absolutely the best That's actually insane I What is this? range on the planet area need no why would he build it here he does know that that command centers can fly because he built one over here earlier why would you okay imagine you really want to use a command center for a wall you can still build it over here initially like this isn't even a full wall now whatever let's continue sorry I just some things here are happening and I have no clue what they are okay here comes a drop oh accidentally spell it up a little bit Happs to the best Oh, drop Boom, boom Get some kills. Not the greatest amount of kills, but once again, just move commanding on creep Not a single scan Okay, here comes the scan Burrow the mine And then you can kind of move back Or you can, yeah, another This was good This is the first time you've almost done it correctly The problem is there's so little mines with this You just dropped all of your mines and now you don't have any splash You also have 194 supply Where's the rest of your army? Holy crap How? This is what, like, 18 Marines, five mines, three marauders? This like legit, like 40 supply that's at home That's like half of your army Hey, you're going to snipe this, that's good. I think you could just kill your opponent Or imagine splitting both armies, just having a double drop here and then the main army going here You're also lacking metaphax, actually even though you haven't lost any yet we're 12 minutes in game right now have you you lost one look at this fight this is an almost max terran player by the way what is this and he's pushing him back okay here we go yeah we're 13 minutes in game you've lost a single meta back and right now you have six meta vex Six How is that even possible? If you ever lose any, it's going to take you 12 minutes to get back to six Oh my God! Corruptors are out. Oh, who, who, who, oh Yeah, no, mines Burrow the mines! Nice Okay This was really good You burrow the mines all at the same time Use the mines Use the mines No They just run back to the mine Captain, we have back up in the south Alright, we'll be heading east Like, who does this? It's actually unbelievable He just lost 50 supply because he didn't want to walk up this ramp again Sir, we've heard that there's landmines in the south All right guys, we won't be going to go in the south there no more Like, Wittal Mines don't have friendly fire Like, Wittal Mines don't have friendly fire This could have, oh my God, this would have been really big in the fight. They actually would have, now you don't have any Mettavacs left, right? Just Marines and Marauders Fantastic The Madafeck is like, you know how you have the pyramid of needs, the pyramid of human needs And on the bottom, it is like food, shelter and water and things like that And then the second one, security, safety, that type of stuff You also have this for Taryn, okay? You have the pyramid of Taryn, and on the bottom of the pyramid, there is Marines, okay? Marines and mines is on the bottom Now, we put Marines on the bottom On the second level, you have mines Without mines, again, Sir, you're not going to make it. Then on the third level, there's going to be Metafax, okay? Your first level is absolutely perfect you got your food, you got your shelter You have plenty of Marines, but you're constantly lacking minds And the worst part is you're not even really lacking minds You have the mines, except you're not using them And then the meta facts, well, you also don't have the third level yet And the fourth level would be marauders, then you get ghost and liberators You seem to just skip certain levels I can't remember I think it's called Maslow's Hierarchy of Health Something like that That's what it's called You have that for Terran as well, TVZ And you're still at the bottom of the pyramid, my friend. So far you only have Marines out of all your base needs And you're securing this area real nice as well Honestly, what actually is it? Okay, you're still up in units lost You're doing fine in that, which is a miracle This shows how cost-efficient Terran is When people say, Terran is cost-efficient, and then Terran is going like, well, I don't think that's true you can just take a look at this guy's fights He's been fighting with half of his army on creep without mines, 90% of the time, and he's still up in units lost The Terran army basically controls itself when it comes to mines These are basically high templar They're hidden, and they auto fire, and they don't require energy. They're too supply and they're insanely cheap It's like a high templar on drugs I can't make this type of propaganda, because most people that watch these videos are Protos players. If I'd say something like this and most of the people watching me were Terran players I probably have like a couple of extra hard attacks around the world you know Ladies and gentlemen we see another spike in that Oh they turned into a planetary It actually works It works the madman did it All right comes back look at that Look at that complete lack of meta facts here Beautiful absolutely beautiful Ultralisks are going to get the Well I'm quite a sure if They're going to get slaughtered or if they turn around that these Marines and marauders are going to get slaughtered There's not a single Mettavac This guy's real balzy. That investor had a fungal, didn't he? I'm pretty sure that investor could have fungled Oh, 74 supply, energy I don't think the Terran clicked that I don't think he was like counting Okay, in three seconds he's going to have 75 I'll snip him before then kind of bossy if your entire army has minus 3 HP I'll give him that That's cool High testosterone move, Napolitans I like it No planetary here You already used these resources on the planetary they wanted to build there Makes sense For a meta-fax being produced at the same time With a couple of ultralisks So the army composition right now is ultralisque, corruptor, single investor, a couple of links. Marine Marauder Mine is pretty okay against that as long as you No way He's like, not my entire army is in the orange yet I think we can do better this Maybe stim another time as you run away Neal He's what an overdosing population looks like Look at that Poor health Where's the metaphics? All right, here we go A couple of metaphics This is going to be another planetary That would make my day Nice And another planetary And another Okay, so he actually just blocks of choke points I don't even mind this too much He's playing in someone that's playing messily bay We haven't seen a single What did he say again? I need to go back Where are you? Inbalance complaint for. Clam is able to beat speed bailings on creep Most people just can do that because it's too difficult to think at the same time for the strategy aspect What strategy aspect? You just, you're following a plan and don't pretend like you're not. And your plan is, your plan is to go Marine Marauder 5 racks Double Factory, Fort Base 8 racks and then you add 3 star or 2 star ports and a Ghost Academy and you go into Liberator Ghost You do this every single game The reason I know this is because your transitions are not like natural transitions in a way You know you just I can see you just following the plan So you're not thinking about the strategy That was an excuse for your poor micro Caught him I mean watching a show lately and when I say lately I mean I watched it once it called how to catch a smuggler and the cops in that show are relatively incompetent or just doing useless work they should hire me because I just caught this guy out on a lie saying that he's thinking about strategy he's not thinking about strategy at all he just doesn't know how to micro oh Are these traders? It's like they see the battle starts happening and they load up in their in their meta-back and they go away. This is the first time he wanted to drop Okay, let's just have a look what happened here with the decision-making Okay, so he has these meta-fax Okay, so he has these metaphics He sees them Okay, he F-2s them back initially Then in his sensor time, and with this mine he sees a massive army come this way and he makes a conscious decision okay he just sees an ultra and ten banlings jump on top of this and his decision here is to send three medevacs filled with units to the far right side as he's being fungled and being overrun by ultras he spent the effort on sending away three medevacs only for them this is my theory to be F-toothed back. See? They turned around I don't think No Did he actually pull them back manually? I can see that with the control groups I want to have another look at this I'm sorry, but this is the most interesting thing I've seen all day I've had a bad day, I can tell you that much Okay He turns them around When does he turn them around? No He does it manually He manually turned them around Which is for? funny because at this point he's already lost the base He has the planetary and has a defensive setup Yeah, now it would make sense to keep going They went back and forth three times In that ping pong medevax. You're going to be in a pretty bad spot now, by the way He is in a pretty bad spot now I do like drop Oh, once again, F-toot This is the problem is that Terrans are too used to F-2ing, that even when they try to do it properly, they really can't It's going to get this base Or maybe this extractor. Depends a little bit he's going for it's going to get the base nice that's really nice this was a good drop your first drop you did and it was well except that it was a little bit slow at uh at getting there it did do a lot of damage that was a good drop i'll give you that nice good job buddy um your follow up here is going to be more ghost i really think a couple of extra mines wouldn't hurt you i feel like at lower level just in general not just lower level at any level minds are just really good having a couple around the map and having 10 12 mines is almost all always worth it honestly. So here you see your opponent in the sensor tower Do you respond to that? Not really Is Liberator stay here? Maybe want to defend that base A couple of snipes Good snipes There's no mines once again So the moment the banlings burst through, your ghosts are actually in semi-trouble EMP, EMP, EMP? EMP? EMP? Well, no EMP He could have EMP What?! What am I looking at? He accidentally used microbial rather than fungal I like this base rate move though, this is good I like this move a lot That's fantastic Actually fantastic You could have maybe picked up and dropped into the main base, but there's a lot of corruptors So, well, went a little bit back It's okay. This has not been great for you Okay? The last quarterfights, what's the units of lost actually? You're still up in yours loss You just haven't been mining as much That's painful Single muo could maybe repair this base and start mining here again I mean, work account is still in a place where it might be possible You fly an orbital over here, throw down a couple of mules I like, well, this is very focused around just this area What if the Zerk, with its huge brain, just kind of walks around? Well, that's not going to work Holy crap Imagine if you would have repaired it just a little bit That would have been sick Because actually, this army wasn't that strong. If he still had his base, if Napoliton still had his base, I think he would be winning I also think if he had two extra minds in this fight, he also would be winning Actually, maybe even right now, he's potentially still winning? He has six ghosts It's not that bad, is it? Fly the orbital Yeah, nice Where are we going? Where are you going? Oh, okay, wants to let the tank out This is great. this is efficiency here this guy the guy from the natural flies over here and the guy from the main to the right so both of them have a longer flight now that's nice that's real nice I love that they can gather a little bit more energy before they land that is the only reason I can get from that it's more trouble as well no well whatever these guys are never gonna leave are they I don't think they're ever gonna leave Do you think you realize that he could just make a MataVec and get them out like that? I don't think so I don't think that's actually going to have it You could also just kill this building. It's not like he's still here at that reactor He already replaced it I don't think our Terran's ever going to realize I don't actually think our Terran is ever going to realize that he can get these out Actually, did-da-da-da-da-da-da-it-da-it-da-it-da-it-da-it-to-day Mid-game quiz Before the end of the game get out of here. if you think the answer is yes press one if you think the answer is no press two good luck we'll come back to that later the midgame quiz we haven't done one of those in a while wonder if hamster still has the animation for that whatever the old tune i did was remember we did this before tough luck people that thought they wouldn't come all right they're out gets a barracks well I do like that a lot I think that's a completely fine call I think that is a completely fine call but he's selecting them I'm so curious what he's doing okay is he just looking at it is this what what high-level strategizing looks like is this the reason why he can micro-bank links well a lot of strategizing there is I think he scanned this and then realized, well, I'm dead. All right. Let's just go over your thing one more time. I think we can both agree that Zerg is completely broken race. It can always make a kill move by making a big amount of the same units that are difficult to deal with until you can get your own answer like Ghost for Hive. Okay. Let's just start at the start. Okay, let's start with your micro because I think I'm immediately going to answer a question here. Zerg is very good at massing units of one type. I agree with that. They have Lings and Banelings and they're very good together. They can switch easily into Hydra Ultralisk composition. They can switch easily into Corruptors if you're building Liberators. However, against Ling-Bainling, if you have marine mine and some marauders, you're just going to trade really well majority of the time, as long as you micro that correctly Every single fight that you have had was A, on creep, B, without sufficient minds, and C, relatively poorly split as well And like no pre-split So none of the conditions that you need to meet in order to have a decent fight against Zirk was ever met And it's even difficult for me to judge your micro in this case If I would tell Klam that every fight against the Zerk would have to be on creep without minds and no pre-splits, he would also lose majority of the fights. Like, these are very simple steps that you can set up So it's not even your micro, it's just the preparation before the fight It sucked I'm sorry Then second, your multitasking, it was non-existent for 16, 17 minutes straight You didn't go clear creep on any other side except the site you were attacking to Your unit movement in general just was off. of your army tended to be at home doing nothing just waiting rather than splitting in two parts or just having a massive push at one end hell even just staying at home and then dropping an army would have been better most of the time because it comes as a surprise now basically what you were doing is you're constantly showing your opponent hey this is a tiny army and i'm over here please come fight me he would fight you you'd fly back with the metaphacks you go with your next army obviously that's not going to work so on on the side of of unit movement you get fairly mediocre stamp, bum For the micro or the pre-fight setup, you get god-awful, bum. And finally, for the strategizing, fantastic I've never seen something like this in my life I can really see why you're having so much trouble dealing with Bain-ins-on-Creat Because I can see your mind is constantly going in overdrive, just strategizing and thinking about other things So for that, you get an absolutely fantastic you're a blessed to hang out with Boom Altogether, sadly, my friend, that still makes a big fat, you suck That's my judgment You have to do with that All right That's going to be it for today's episode of Is it Inba or Do I Suck?

How's your Zirk to GM? I'm a Zerk too I'm about to be masters. If I have a master bother, guess what they will call me They'll call me Baby Caryl I just had a game versus a provost effort, though He wasn't doing anything I did all that I could, and was ten times above his skill level There was no storm he could have hit I know you probably hear this every day day, but I'm sick of Skytles camping and sitting doing nothing I even watched all the Lambo guides that I could find on the internet and watch Cerro every day I got a replay folder full of Cerro's games and his VODs as well I like the crap you did with Rainer and Lambo You and the boy's Slay Anyways, I hope you get this man. Hit me back Just a chat through your biggest fan This is Stan My points are gone, I'm wondering why Who did I see up at all? Protostero roots my latter. see no green at all even if I could it would all be fake Cyril's pictures on my wall it reminds me that it's not so bad it's not so bad has some trouble the zvp enjoyer he's called on the letter it's uh you have some trouble with skytles camping sitting around doing nothing first of all very nice balance complaint creative indeed good job good job let's have a look at this game though see if you're as creative in playing the video game as you're creative in writing complaints about the video game so actually i didn't even check what what leak you are let's do that first huh what it's a Diamond, EU, 4300. So a pretty decent player, okay, on the way to Masters, that's for sure If you're Diamond and 4 3K MMR, you're on the way to Masters You're getting close to it Let's see if that's going to be, if that shows here All right, opponent is meta, who is, of course, a Protos player We're going to be paying some attention to the Protos player, and we're going to be paying some attention to the Zirk player as well Look at this This is beautiful He also has the rapid fire on the move command it whenever he moves his units Just infinite spam So I think the APM, yep, it's going to be really high because of rapid fire. This is the beauty of watching Zirk replays It doesn't matter what level the Zerk is If the Zerk knows about rapid fire, they're going to have 1900 average APM Look at this This guy's Diamond with his 300 APM, just rapid firing his life away, spamming rally points and spamming other move commands You absolutely love to see it All right Actually, this is not a bad game to start with Look at this Look at this harassment This guy's doing a pretty decent job, harassing with the probe I'm kind of impressed by that Going to be seeing actual build orders as well, as we've hit a part of the ladder here where people tend to employ real build orders I think usually above 4K, 4. 1K, at least the first four to five minutes tend to be relatively standard After that, all bets are off and you can do whatever you want again But the first four minutes, they really do like their systematic approach in doing build orders that they've copied from professional players or from non-professional players or from players that cosplay as professional players, you know, the whole range of people that you can learn from And it looks like both players have an opener that makes some sense, at least And that's always nice to see already to start with I do like that Double queens going, coming out, and then I'll start his speed. Curious to see if he's going to take the forward base or if he's going to expand in a triangle That's always kind of important So the triangle expansion, I think, is much preferred in ZVP at least Sometimes you see the forward one if they want to do an ill-advised queen attack But so far he's not sending, he hasn't started this speed either yet So he wants to get the hatchery and then go into speed Meanwhile, at the Protosite, we see the standard Stargate behind the natural Honestly, I have nothing to complain so far Both of these players seem to absolutely know what they're doing He loses his worker, unfortunate, but also not the end of the world, maybe for a cheeky sky. As you see the Zerk go around with this Zirg link to try and get some information with that bad boy Third Hatchery is built on location, the way it's supposed to be It would be really odd if the third hatchery was built in the main base I've seen things in my time, all right I've seen some things I remember one time I got a replay where a command center started building a planetary on the other side of the map And ever since then, I haven't been the same I didn't quite realize how deep the pit goes There's a movie called, I think it's called the hole, El Jolla, or something like this I think it's a Spanish movie. And the concept of this movie is that you have a lot of layers where people live It's like a prison And at the top layer comes a mess It's called a platform actually, not the whole The platform is what it's called There's a platform with lots of food in it Okay And the people on the top floor, you get it placed on a different floor every single month And the people of the top floor get to eat first, and then the platform goes to the next floor, basically And it keeps going down And if you're at the bottom, you basically have no food left. So, yeah, I always thought that there was an end to that pit as well in StarCraft 2, where eventually, you know, at the bottom of that prison, there's nothing anymore And the platform will have to go back up to be refilled eventually In StarCraft 2, that doesn't seem to be the case There's a bottomless pit of complete idiots there Like, it just keeps going down They actually infinity When mathematicians think about infinity, they think about the amount of crap players that there are in StarCraft 2 And that is how they come close to an estimation of what the number infinite actually means This is true You can Google this Don't do that All right Now, this opener now makes no sense anymore. So we started with a centicle opener from this protos, and then he built two sentries, while he needs to be afforded his expensive, his gas-intensive tech and probably more Stargate units So I'm very curious to see what he's going to be doing Unless this is like an immortal push, this doesn't make a lot of sense Meanwhile, the Zirk player is playing a pretty standard game It's a good worker count, spreading some creep across the map He has close to zero information right now He saw the second gate start That is something His spores are really late as well Has absolutely no overall threat, which makes sense because there is a void ray out. But he also doesn't have his queens in proper positions and didn't have spores ready in the basis where he needed to have them Even though there is a void, right, you can still put an overlord over here or over here, maybe over here So you have at least some extra vision of where these oracles, or in this case, this single oracle might be coming from Extra gas is being taken all at the same time This is obviously the optimal solution usually So the way that it works in StarCraft 2 is that the one resource that provides economy is minerals So the longer you're mining minerals, the more resources, it snowballs into more resources. Because everything you need to build to gather more resources requires minerals Nothing requires gas Think of queens, hatcheries, drones, extractors Anything that could provide you with more economy requires minerals, never gas So the longer you can delay your gas mining, the better your economy is going to be And that is always the goal of any Zerk player and in general, also with Teram, it process a little less because all of our good units require gas, so we do want to get gas pretty quickly But as long as you can delay the gas, you want to be delaying it as a Zerk And we've seen ZVP Enjoyer It's been doing a pretty decent job by that His third base is extremely late. He's been floating 900 minerals, which makes no sense And I'm not quite sure why he's doing that either He hasn't scouted gases yet either. So actually everything he's been doing is, it's been a little bit risky as the scouting has been mediocre he just went up to a very high work count takes this base as a fourth base i don't like this and no one really likes this because it's a bad fourth base um it's it's a relatively short path to attack it isn't easy to expand from here to anything else like this is an outside base and uh this ramp down makes it potentially vulnerable to force field um there's not a very wide angle where you can engage with a big amount of roaches Imagine the ProD's over here. Storms could be very powerful, aggressively, and it's difficult to get creep here as well, which means that this is just a prime location to attack I'd always say pick this middle base You can clear the rocks, and I basically have a 360 surround, easy fifth base You have access to potentially this base as well once you get this down, and creep spread just progresses very naturally on from there So not a huge fan of this Also, way oversaturated for anything happening yet minerals in the bank Now, this looks bad Okay, and it actually is bad I was going to say, if he has the larva available, what? Why? Okay. If you're long distance mining with, what is this, 20 workers or something, you just should take this gas Because as a Zerk, eventually against Tos, you are going to need the gas And it's better to take the gas than long distance mining Before you saturate your fourth base, you always take the sixth gas in this matchup The only time you don't is in like CVZ when you're messing roaches or in ZVT when you're playing LingBain off of four gas or maybe if you're really old school Lingbane Hydra off of five gas but that isn't very popular anymore because it sucks Otherwise always get your six gas faster and in this case definitely get your six gas faster. Another thing I would like to get your attention to is I've mentioned this many times before for other races where I always say hey if you're struggling with spending your money just get extra production I know it's really cool when you see Cerro and Lombo and Dark having four hatcheries and they always have 10 minerals because they have perfect inject If you don't have perfect inject, just get an extra hatchery in your main base And once you realize that you can spend all your money with that and maybe you're lacking money, then you can take it away again once you reach a higher level But there's absolutely no shame in spending all your money very quickly. in real life I would not I would not suggest that but in StarCraft 2 try to spend your money as fast as you can sometimes you can save larvae if you have like 1,800 minerals and 1,800 gas in the bank and you want to wait until you can build 18 mutalis then yeah that's completely fine but otherwise I wouldn't say that's a absolutely great idea you have scouted absolutely nothing about your opponent's composition so you don't really know a lot you know there's a couple of gateways but you don't know much more going into seven gas now while still having this gas. It's actually a little bit annoying because actually all of your transitions as a Zerk, especially once you go into hive or things like lurkers or even like something like banlings, you require a crap ton of gas as Zerk into that mid to late game transition stage In the mid game, perhaps not so much, but in that mid to late game transition, you're going to be getting two, three upgrades at the same time You're going to be getting a hive You'll be getting gas units that you need to invest in Now, here we see something as well that is always so interesting to me. So basically you decide to go for a timing attack here, right? You're maxing out on an army that is relatively easily replaceable and doesn't scale well into a late game And yet, you're not attacking with it So you're basically doing a timing attack, but you're not attacking and you're not hitting a timing And the word or the phrase timing attack consists of two words and you're doing neither So the moment you're doing a timing attack, hit at the correct timing And that timing was either the moment you hit max or if you would have timed this out a little bit better with plus two. Now you're already delayed, what was it? Maybe 20 seconds or so where you probably could have been hitting faster You're just kind of running around doing nothing Because for whatever reason, all of these units are so late You were floating a lot of money You could have built these earlier If you're hitting timings, the main thing of the timing is to hit as fast as possible So it might look nitpicky to talk about 10, 15, 20, 30 seconds, but 30 seconds is a difference between storm finishing and not finishing It's a difference between one immortal extra being out or a cannon and a battery finishing up, you know These things do matter. So to start the fight off, you're going to walk into two stasis wards, but you do catch your opponent out of position because he had zero map control. This is probably going to be a pretty decent fight here. There's a couple of storms. You're not aware of that whatsoever, but now you see it so you start presplitting. This is very good. The fight so far, control-wise, has been pretty good. I don't really like that you're sending eight Hydras here because this is a lot of DPS that could be assisting you in the battle. I think if you do three Hydras, you still get a lot of workers and you have a little bit extra DPS. Doesn't matter too much because you absolutely just destroyed your opponent Okay? You have infinite larvae in the bank You killed a creptone of workers You killed every single unit that he ever had and you completely burst open this base So at this point, what I would recommend is you did your damage with the first push, your plus two just finished, is you just go again immediately into the same location Okay? And the reason you want to go into the same location is because you already busted this open You know there is no wall here anymore, which gives you free entry here It allows you to make a very big concave over here as well. Well, at the other basis, there's still a stasis ward here There's four cannons There's two batteries And even though it might be a surprise that you, you show up there Very often, if you completely burst through like you just did, you killed all of his important units It's just better to go into the same spot exactly, right? It's if you dig a hole, basically, the first day, because you're trying to get to water, then sure, the ground might be very surprised And be like, oh, no, he's going to dig at a different side now if you do that the next day But it doesn't make a lot of sense, because you already have this massive hole that you just duck. And as we see, you actually are going to be going here I was kind of afraid of this This is something you see a lot at lower levels So you're now attacking into cannons First of all, it gives your opponent quite a lot of time to respond to that And also it's going to give this army a pretty decent position here in this choke This is nice to defend Gets a couple of decent storms You're completely clumped up You send 10 roaches here and they won't be able to do anything So I feel like this fight should have been completely one-sided If you fight in the open, you're just absolutely going to destroy him No chance Now he at least got some kills. It still wasn't a great fight for him You guys are equal right now in the unit lost that, but it just wasn't that great of a fight for you Well, it was a good fight, but it should have been fantastic You should have just A-moved all over him, won the game Actually, you just won the game anyway, so it doesn't really matter I'm curious to see how you're going to lose this game You should obviously be mining from this gas Once again, you're lacking a little bit of gas. in total the earlier you get those gases going the better you're already on well you should be on 10 gas that's exactly what you're doing that's good that actually is really good going into hive as well i would suggest even already having the hive at this point and having a second evo chamber so you can get carapace upgrades now that you see carriers very often carriers if there's a carapace upgrades they don't do too well especially if there's not a good templar counter there's no disruptors your opponent has none of that carapace helps so much against interceptors just like plus attack upgrades would help a lot for your opponent but he isn't doing that so would carapace really help for you now at this point you're still working with these armies that are easy to replace for you are relatively cheap and you can build them very quickly um so you just should continuously be attacking into this like the moment you have a new army you go as long as you're trading semi okay because you're completely out mining your opponent especially in the gas department so you go in i really do like this i think this is a fantastic call and now Now you basically, after the second day, you dug your second hole, rather than digging a third hole trying to go in here, you decide, okay, I'm going to go here again. And you see, no cannons, no batteries, no storms, you're just straight up going to walk through I really do like that And as you kill this fort base, you now know that your opponent truly has nothing So you could start thinking, there's a couple of things you could do You could either really prepare for a longer late game or you can just keep pushing the issue again and again and again and keep trading cost efficiently or semi-cost efficiently because you're double outmining your opponent If you want to be trading, the only thing that matters is time You need to go as fast as possible And you can still keep going in and do things behind it So you're getting a spire. You can get a second evo chamber, go up to 12 gases, you know, that type of stuff, as long as you're trading semi-okay The only thing is that as long as you're building HydraLIS, you need to be trading quick and you need to be trading semi-cost efficiently Okay, at least I would say one to one and a half or something like that So for every hundred resources you lose, he needs to lose 150 It's not quite the case here, I think I think he lost, no, actually it almost seems okay At this point, however, you didn't kill, so you need to realize here what happened in this fight, okay? So in this fight, what you kill is mainly interceptors, a couple of stalkers. and maybe you shot half a carrier, did you? No, there's no carrier down, yes, so probably not And you didn't kill Templar either So your opponent kept a lot of its assets that do well against an army that consists of mainly hydras, especially if you wouldn't have morphed his Templar into Arcons immediately I would not suggest going straight back into Hydra again You could get a couple of hydras or you could get a bunch of hydras again, but you need to add something to it because the trades aren't going well anymore And in that case, I'd probably say, well, add a couple of. of vipers here, perhaps start thinking of getting some lurkers so you can deal with the ground and then your hydra viper can deal with the air That way you can transition out of hydras into a composition that especially against a three-based protols is going to be absolutely viable It's not the greatest and at higher levels I'd always say eventually need to go into double spire, corruptor viper. But at this level, anything up until like 6K MMR, which is like top 50, top 60, a hydra-lurker viper is going to do absolutely fine against any Protos player because the control of their templar is too tricky because the range of the lurker is very large can just kind of fly around with these vipers and grab stuff now you go into 23 corruptors and hydras and both of these units have a similar purpose they're there well the hydra is there to kill interceptors and eventually win a game or to abduct a unit and then kill that unit specifically and the corruptor is also there only to deal with the carrier. Right now, you have nothing that deals with the ground, which could potentially be dangerous if your opponent decides to attack at this point or you're forced into a fight at this point Also, the complete lack of viper is really pissing me off The viper is like the High Templar of Protles It is absolutely vital in the army Sure, there are games you can win without the High Templar, and sure there are games you can win without the Viper, but it just makes life a lot easier if you do get those units You're going to be going for. This run by is really nice if your opponent has eight bases and is extremely spread out, but your opponent has one and a half mining base, so you're just going to give him a lot of your units And this is not really the transition that you want If you're transitioning out of an army, you want to either do it gradually and slowly get rid of these units, or you want to just continue and build on the units. that army with like a hydro lurker fiber even though like you said at high level not the greatest composition but definitely viable no second spire either for carapace upgrades which is a mistake you're getting brute lords now so the army composition most likely is going to be brute lord corruptor infester viper as that is probably the most correct composition there is to go into a late game as long as there's no tempest out most of the time zirk is going to be absolutely fine with that army and once there's tempest out you can often use small run bys to deal with outside bases. You do need some type of spellcasters though, or you're going to be fighting against a bunch of spellcasters without any spellcasters, and that can be very tricky, especially because your upgrades also kind of suck, okay? Go forward with the Brutelords and with the corruptors We can tank a couple of storms This is not the greatest control of the corruptors What was that last shot? Did you Okay, let's just follow, okay. So the first shot is on this carrier the second shot is on a different carrier then you go back to that carrier you clear that carrier so four shots two carriers you shoot this and here i guess you turn around too fast so rather on getting three carriers you only got two um and then you keep pushing i'm not quite sure if you can't keep pushing look how low all of your corruptors are and look how much stuff he still has this is not really the way you want to be fighting you're going to kill most of the ground but I mean, you just don't have enough units to kill his error He could have just used the carriers and beating you there. Probably should have returned a little Are you just dead now? You don't really have upgrades You're losing all of your broodlords Your spores also could have been pushed forward, by the way I kind of forgot about those That was the game? I guess you were kind of dead if he would have attacked, but he wasn't attacking. It still had pretty decent income, especially gas income was good i don't know i'm not sure a if you should have left and b why you would complain about a game like this it seems pretty clear to me that you're you're a single hotkey user you use one hotkey and you just go with that army and you expect to win and then you're probably also the type of guy that completely complains about carrier a move all you did this game was a move with armies and sometimes your army was better and then you won and sometimes your army was worse and then you lost the fight Like, you need to improve your army in order to win fights. Like, this is a little bit of a confusing game, because very often when I get these games, I see the Zerg working hard and, you know, with two, three control groups, infestors and vipers, but you just, you didn't even have upgrades on your second army composition Like, I just don't understand what your goal was here You did fantastic with the Roach hydrat timing Your macro seems completely fine Your creeps threat for a 4 3K player was great as well, but your unit control was quite frankly atrocious You did very little correct I mean, you just kind of A moved into this area and then there was some pre-splitting going on initially with a-hreau Then the second attack, I mean, you just A-moved again. Then the attack over here, you A-move, but you had no spellcast Yeah, I really can't say anything here except your army composition just wasn't good Everything else you did was good. Like your macro was completely fine, but, you know, if your goal, if your goal in life is is to build a boat and the only tool you have is a toothpick is just going to be really difficult to build a boat and I know there's people that build these small sized boats out of toothpicks and I'm sure there's one guy that spent 12 years of his life building a massive boat out of toothpicks and I'm sure you guys will talk about in a comment but in general if you're going to build a boat the toothpick is not the thing the material you want to use you know and planks and hammers and, I guess, nils and salts and that type of stuff. You just had the incorrect tools, not easier or harder tools You just didn't have the correct tools You just used corruptor Brutlord without upgrades to end with Corruptor Brutlord is fine, but they require the supplement of the investor So honestly, your micro, well, it was non-existent, so you get a neutral stamp there I guess we make that orange maybe, the orange stamp, neutral, no clue We didn't see it it exists, maybe it doesn't, then your macro was fantastic, especially for this level Like, you completely out-macrored your opponent, you had insanely good creep spread, but your unit composition just freaking sucked. Like you massed hydras one too many times, you built 30 hydras when you shouldn't anymore, or you should have transitioned out of it and probably have gotten Carapace upgrades a long time ago, and then you went into corruptor Brutelord, you A moved into your opponent, they were like, well, I didn't win, this game sucks, it's broken Yeah, I, that was God awful, like actually, monstrosity, terrible, terrible is the stamp I want on the unit comp Bam, and altogether, that makes it, sorry to say, a massive suck Sorry, you do suck All right, that's going to be it for today's episode of IOTIS If you enjoyed it, be sure to hit the like button, subscribe to your general.

        "text": "Dear Harstam, this Protos player I faced is so used to playing against marine reactor expense that he struggled to deal with my Reaper On top of that, he did absolutely zero scouting other than the first probed and adept No hallucination and his shade never got in For this reason, I decided to fly my halion drop around to keep it hidden My brain is bigger than his, and my reasoning paid off as I killed 16 probes for three helions and a medevac When he took this much economic damage I knew I just had to not take random damage from Blinkstalkers, which I didn't. I thought I would be in a good spot from this point, but the Protos units just crushed my first push like an ant I'll admit he was patient, made a nice around, but anyone can do that with zealots In the meantime, I played faster than him with Raven harass, and had a double drop in his main shortly after, but lucky for him, recall is a thing After this, he just moves out and kills me without any effort I had absolutely terrible vision and didn't see his move out, but I don't think vision would have mattered Name, find my appi, race, terran league, grandmaster, 5 6K MMR, European Terran player, and his opponent is going to be Showtime All right. So just to make sure that everyone knows, showtime is about a usually floating around 6 8, 6 9K MMR. This guy is what, what was he? 5-6 Why isn't my game speeding up? There we go So that means that this is about a 1,200 MMR difference. The freaking audacity of this guy to send in a replay against Showtime though, that's something big. Holy crap. This is what Terrans do, okay? It doesn't matter who they're playing against. Terrans actually believe this. Terrans actually believed that if the game was balanced, that find my Appi should be capable of destroying showtime on the ladder. They think this is insanity. 1,200 MMR, okay? 1,200 MMR. That's low Grandmaster against the absolute top of Grandmaster. This is the difference between like a silver two player and a master's three player or like maybe Diamond 1 That is the level of difference we're talking about here I never get that replay though, do I? I never get a replay from the Silver 2 Protols who played against his Zirk friend that is 1,200 MMR above him, saying, hey, I didn't manage to beat my friend who's been playing for five years more than me This is imbalance No, you only get this with low Grandmaster Terrans This is what they do This is what they do All right, let's have a quick look at what's happening here He said he struggled with my Reaper because he's only used to playing against Marine Reactor Expans. Now, let's see if that's correct I already see something here This is Okay, so what's happening here is Showtime is playing the map Showtime is a highly intelligent player And I'm going to pause the game here for a bit I'm going to explain you guys a little bit of game theory, okay? On this map, walling off the Reaper ramp is so good because you can double wall this with a gateway and a Cybercor, have your pylon over here, and hide your tech in this location This means that if there is a Reaper wall, that the Reaper will never be able to scout what tech the Protos is doing. As most Protos do a Reaper wall, this means that building a Reaper on this map is really dumb Or well, really dumb It's not really dumb, it's just it tends to be very useless As a result, what Showtime decides to do is he plays Nexus before Core, and that means his first adept is going to be delayed, and also that he won't have a Reaper wall If his opponent opens Reaper, he's going to be in a bit of trouble because his first adept is late and there is no Reaper wall If his opponent opens up with a Marine, it's going to be in a great spot So that's kind of what Showtime is hoping for, that this opponent does the more intelligent thing. Now, that doesn't mean that you should never play Reaper on Oxide I think it's good to mix it in, but whenever you see a very good player struggle with something, always try to think, hey, why is this? Was there something different in the build order here that I missed? And in this case, the answer is, yes, I missed something in the build. order as find my appi probably doesn't even know the difference between a Nexus first and a core first he's going to be popping in we'll be able to pick of one yep one probe that's actually just the way it's supposed to be this reaper should die though just pull the workers put that was really sloppy that actually was dealing with it poorly you know what i find my appi i'm going to give you this one one o for you you know you manage to stay alive with the reaper and you kill the you kill the worker so good job um you even manage to scout attack i believe yeah so this is At this point, the Reaper's already done his job. He can do two things with this Reaper A, he can keep it alive to check for a potential third base and for like a moveout, so you can just poke in every now and then over here and you just patrol this area and sometimes poke in here just to make sure nothing is leaving the base, maybe even see like the ADEP moving out or whatever Or second, you can try to jump in again, scout the secondary tech, like whether that's a robo or blink, and maybe get another worker kill Because there's no Reaper wall. Showtime needs to keep both of his units at home actually I understand why he's moving out with this because he wants to get information but this is kind of dangerous because he only has a single unit at home so if a Reaper walks into the natural he might be in trouble Adept scouts what did he see well not much really he saw a barracks and that's pretty much it didn't see anything else so a complete lack of Marines in total though so maybe that's a clue It's hard to say Shata wants to take a third base, so he moves there, and now the Reaper comes in I'm not sure if this is good timing out of Find My Appie. Like he knew that this stalker was going to move out But if it was, then that's pretty sick If it wasn't, then, well, nice, nice lucky Two workers have been killed so far Yeah, that's nice It's a good start It's honestly a good start The follow-up was going to be a Where did he go? What is this? flying pad Did you just fly to the corridor? I love to see this It is Why is he going over here first? Why don't you just straight away go to the left? I'm fine with it You know what? I don't even care You're allowed to do what you want, find my up. If you think this is the way to go, then this is the way to go You know that? That is absolutely fine We have a factory, a Raven So it's going to be a third C Or sorry, factory Raven Factory Starport So most likely going to be C This is a build that someone like Hero Marine would do a lot And if Hero Marine kills like three workers with his aliens, he'll move out afterwards with his barracks, with his three barracks production and just kill you with like three, four tanks, a Raven, one one upgrades He hits at like 7 40, I believe, usually 735, something like that, like 120 supply Like actually, absolutely insane amounts. Hero Marine is probably, I think he's one of the best triple-CC openers in the world Like he just has one of the best triple-c-c opener out of anyone Okay, so this is actually going to do a crap ton of damage here That's really, really sick Now, this is going to sound stupid, and I'm going to make an excuse here for showtime, okay? His start was a little bit rough, and he actually held all of his units in position until the timing for a helion drop was completely open Over So, like, this actually made sense It makes sense that there's nothing in the main base at five minutes. You want to be moving out, or you want to be starting to think about defending your. third maybe there's going to be a push or something it is a little bit risky because you didn't have the observer here yet so moving out well you open yourself for this type of stuff but yeah like i understand why this happens it's not good it's not pretty and it's not super tight out of showtime but i understand why it happens now while this is happening it's always important to know what's going on on the other side of the map okay so yes our friend is doing a lot of damage but take a look at this supply block okay okay Let's have a look at this supply block This is a supply block of a lifetime. So he drops these and at this point, it wouldn't surprise me if this Terran player does nothing but micro the cars So we're going to see if that's correct 70 out of 70 at 5 minutes He shoots He shoots He's building SUV, he's not realizing he's supply block Look, he's constantly swapping You can see that here in the bottom He's building more and more units it's not realizing his supply block still He's going to wait for his CC to finish most likely Every time he loses a unit, he can build more units Yeah, he was supply block during the entirety of this He actually waited for his CC to finish That's going to be the first time he's going to get unsupply block. It's going to get double refinery before the eBay's as well, and he's floating 500 minerals He's going to be floating a fair amount of money He's going to go, where's he going? Where actually is he going? Not going to go straight for an orbital command Now the follow it most of the time is indeed going to be blink stalkers So you always got to be a bit careful against that I like the bunker on the high ground He's not producing anything out of these barracks These tanks are not in position either Like what are these tanks defending? This tank is actually reaching nothing It isn't defending his mineral line. It isn't even really, well, it's defending the bunker I guess, but if he jumps up here, he doesn't defend anything, doesn't defend the low ground, this is a really bad tank This tank also isn't that useful as it's not defending this bunker Like nothing is defending this bunker and there's two tanks out Now finally unit production continues, here we go It took a long time for anything to happen here There's almost 24 seconds without any production on this barracks eBay's still not going down by the way 200, 300 gas in the bank He's going to get Metafax before he's going to be able to get his upgrades going That is extremely rare That is extremely rare, actually I really don't like that. So even though he said he didn't take any real damage from the Blinkstalker attack, he took a lot of indirect damage because his macro isn't that good Like, and he's been messing up his build order Double Depot drop at the same time as well right now and still almost instantly supply block again That's going to cost him money No worker production during this I don't even know why, because he did have the money Now he can finally start 1-1 1-1 is never going to finish for this push Unless he decides to push at like the 9-minute mark or something like that, this is never going to actually do it He has no real It just has so little units because he's lacking money. He also didn't manage to land this third base yet, which is a little bit surprising, because he should have been able to land that, already You should have just been a little bit more confident in moving out Now, this push is about to hit at this point, I guess, with 1-1, Stimbat Maybe not with 1-1, yeah, with Stim and combat for sure It's going to start moving out There's a decently sized army I should cancel this bunker I'm not quite sure if this is enough He just lacks a bit of money and got supply block a lot But, you know, he's going to get a setup here He's going to get a setup That's nice at least. Should be sieging up at least a single tank already All tanks at the same time This siege up really achieved nothing I wouldn't mind if this was two tanks and then two extra tanks are being sent forward Good first force field out of showtime Like you're not forcing anything here, you know? This has now been two siegeups, which basically delayed this fight by about 20 seconds And he hasn't really been producing too much behind this I'm not quite sure why that is he just hasn't been It has two extra barracks, but there's just no real units being built I don't quite understand what's happening But double armory is what's happening Maybe it's a Mac transition? I haven't seen that before. See, yeah, this army now is just, it's the same army as it was about a minute ago, except Showtime had three extra warping rounds So yeah, he's going to clean it up, of course It's not that big of a surprise So Terran loses about everything Doesn't really have a lot of reinforce Where are the reinforcements? I was going to get the double drop in the main If this would have happened a bit faster, it would have been sick, or if this first fight would have happened a bit faster Gets a double drop into the main, yeah, but there's a recall Yeah I mean, that's life, isn't it? That's just what happens. Like there's recall available, he uses a recall and you get pushed out. So what did you say in your little thing? What did you say? I thought I would be in a good spot from this point the Proton's units just crushed my first push like an end yeah sure because you announced you were there a minute ahead of time then you stood around doing nothing seizing the rocks rather than seizing your opponent's base not fighting reinforcements being slow you'll admit he was patient he wasn't even patient there was just no use for him to attack into you like he wasn't under siege this is like if you would set up camp outside of someone's fortress and then you still see the supply lines supplying the fortress and you just wave at the guys bringing them like the cards and the wagons filled with food for the castle it's like you just didn't cut anything off you weren't doing any damage it wasn't threatening at all like you might as well have been sieged up at your home base it didn't matter in the meantime I played faster than him with what with Raven Arras and had a double drop in his main shortly after, wait, did I miss the Raven Ars? This Raven got four kills. What do you mean? Played faster with my Raven Arras You might have killed like half an observer and two workers Played faster with the Raven Arras I don't care if you played faster It's whether you do damage or not I can also play faster than my opponent If I smash my keyboard with my fist a couple of times, but I don't think it will achieve a whole lot How's you say? And you had a double drop in his main shortly after Just getting a double drop into someone's main doesn't mean that that's a good thing You know, I can have a mothership and eight carriers into my opponent's main base as well. But if my opponent has 25 corruptors, three vipers and four investors there, that's actually a bad thing, not a good thing Like, you're just saying things that don't really mean anything But let's continue this game As Showtime is still looking for a drop You just lost two drops for free, is really what happened This drops stayed alive, but you lost these ones, and you lost the main army as well, basically So all your tanks are gone, your major defense is gone You now have two armories, and you have a Ghost Academy Ghost Academy is really useful and actually is the correct call here I do like that a lot You realize your opponent is going into storm rather than going into anything else. Probably you could show all the Templar Archives and the Double Forge, I guess, with your Raven, which isn't being used right now So nice playing faster here Probably could just throw down a turret at some point You also have no map control, no map vision One of the main concepts, this is good, one of the main concepts in PVT or one of the main things in PVT is being on the map Protos armies very often are stronger than Terran armies in most stages of the game. The problem for Prodos is that they can't get across the freaking map because the moment they move across the map, there's five drops in their main base and two in their natural and they just can't move out You, however, are actually completely blind You have a drop on the right side You have a raven here You have not a single Marine on the map You don't really have anything You're building four turrets Also, your fort base is really late, by the way I'd like to focus some attention on that That your fort base really is quite late Now, he's just going to walk in You don't have any mines burrowed He storms your entire arm. What were you looking at? So you have 29 workers on one base, some slight oversaturation But what are you doing? I just don't understand it Okay, two more barracks You're going up to 7 wrecks of 76 workers before a 4th base Guess you you're scanning And I see, oh crap, my entire army It dies Yeah, I mean, this is what happens If you don't look at your army for 15 seconds, someone manages to take down these rocks without you noticing and move their entire army across the map and you're not prepared or even controlling your army, you're just going to lose the game. If you're standing still and a Zerk throws in 30 bailings into your army, it's weird to complain that balings are too strong No, you just stood still and tank the banlings If I hold position in a 15-tank army, I'm also going to lose my entire army Then I could potentially complain that tanks are too strong if I'm hold-positioned in a tank line I think that would be a rather silly thing to do Now, we could look at this game and we could actually perhaps even make the argument that Terran is the imbalance one here, okay? You're a player that is 5 6K I played the reverse card You're a 5 6k player with obviously inferior mechanics than your opponent. The problem for ProDos is that they always need to gamble in the early game So it's very tricky to play PVT, especially against lower level players that don't really know what they're doing too much You build a Reaper, which, you know, I can accept Then your Hellion drop pad makes very little sense It hits like literally 35 seconds too late Confuses showtime He loses a lot of units If you were semi-competent going into a mid-game, if you hit your timing's correct, you got your upgrades on time, or you would have macroed at any point in the game, you probably just would have won and beaten a guy that is literally the difference between silver two and diamond one. Like, he is that much better than you, and you still got close I don't actually think that Protos is the imbalance one if we look at this replay This is someone that honed his crafts, been playing for over 10 years Every single game, six, seven hours, one of the brightest analytical minds and you got him because you delayed your helen drop by 30 seconds? How dare you? Unbelievable No map vision, poor unit control, bad execution in the macro, a lucky early game and you think you deserve this win? No, what you deserve is this Bam! The mega suck stamp!

        "text": "Dear Harstam, I know that you're bored about complaining about Skytos, so I get something different I played against Protos, go 12 pool and have some damage on his eco, but he built Mass Stalker High Templar I got my 3-3 upgrades before his ground attack 3 upgrade, if my memory is good, and I build Mass Roach, which, if I know correctly, counter-stalkers. And Templars too, because they are tanky, but he's beating me, no matter how hard I try and how much roaches I build, he's unbeatable and he don't even get disruptors or sentry just stalkers and that's it he won with 310 upgrades this guy should truly start considering using punctuation i know that i didn't attack his basis but it's still embarrassing out of context he almost stole my nickname so i wanted to beat him even harder but you will see is it imba or do i suck and sorry for this ant words but it was late and i was tired and he frustrated me to maximum so you know but i have to so you know but i have to i do i do i do i do do know but you have to indeed name tolo race zirk league bronze we're indeed here in a bronze league replay starting with a 12 pool you know you see the links making their way across the map this actually seems a properly timed 12 pool I have to admit the links leave at around the time where you would expect links to leave with a 12 who may be three or four seconds delayed we'll see it's actually pretty funny it's tollot versus tolo it is very similar nicknames He said a couple of boys get left behind here. Oh, they move back to make sure that the others can catch up. A rally point over here. Start chasing a worker now. You love to see it. Now, let me explain you guys a little bit about the 12-pool. The 12-pool is a strategy that is supposed to hit as tightly as possible. And the reason for this is because if the Protoss had scouted, which, let's be real, the Protoss didn't. He could already have a Zealot out and his Cybernetics Core could have been done already had he gone Gateway before Nexus which the toss did here but for some reason his core still isn't done for another 12 seconds and his first Adept could be out in about 14 seconds. This is why you need to hit as tight as possible around like 153 154 Our man hit about 20 seconds late 15 seconds late that's okay What is this micro? I've never seen this before in my life He is stutter stepping with links Okay, wait, I want to zoom in on this To truly, I want to open up the APM tab here Okay, so currently he's spamming 200 APM on stuttering Look at this Does one damage on this worker, like a 5, 10 damage on this worker, then goes to the next one, goes back to this one He's just damaging every worker individually Look There's like five, six, what is it? Seven, eight workers that are damaged here None of them have died. 400 apm of this Look at this He goes back now Has one link still at the ramp Goes in again 300 apm Of moving back and forth getting hit Look, he doesn't even attack anymore He hasn't done a single damage I feel like an AI easy would be doing a better job with this control He actually, he did 10 damage total on two of these probes now with 4 links He lost 3 links to do 10 shield damage He killed nothing He did zero damage None So the trade, didn't he say he did eco damage? I played against Protos 12 pool and have some damage on his eco. Well, that's a bit much, no? He pulled workers away to deal with your 12 pool So you delay your hatchery by like 45 seconds in your case She also went a very fast gas for some reason Delayed your eco, cut workers, so that your opponent had to pool workers of the mineral line for about 25 seconds before you lost six links By the way, with a 12 pool, you're supposed to build 10 links at least You're supposed to get the gas way after the hatcher because you can't really do much of anything You damaged two workers That's it Two workers One worker lost 5 HP and the other one lost 10 HP. So for the price, the small price of about what, the 12 pool cost I think about like maybe 500 minerals or so, or 400 minerals, a normal 12 pool You managed to do 15 damage Spread over two probes That is just impressive as a result I don't think that would be possible Even the Red Cross does more damage in their operations And they're a charity that tends to heal people Like they accidentally dry over like a rabbit or something like that You know? Like on their way to set up tents Holy crap You just start a charity my friend The way that you manage to keep things alive Even if it isn't your intention is very important is just big. This could be big for the world, my friend You should become the accidental doctor, you know? Planning a military, like, governments can hire you for military missions where you think you're about to attack an area, but really they just want the people there to get better They send you in Here comes Super Tolo again It's a bit like the Truman Show Everyone is in on the joke, except for you You buy all these RPGs and weapons try to shoot down a building, accidentally create a brilliant piece of architecture and saving the lives of many people at the same time Not sure how you would do it, but you can Holy crap, that was terrible, Ling Micro Actually awful. We often discuss the concept of negative micro, but this is taking it to the next level, my friend Very impressive Okay, your follow-up is going to be what? double evo Okay, so you're talking about the fast upgrades that you were getting, the quick layer You're down about 15 workers, but let's just pretend that isn't the case here So right now you're about 500 down in mineral income, about 300 down in gas income, which means your opponent is going to be capable of building a lot more units Your opponent also is just up in supply overall, but you do have very nice upgrades. I'm going to give you that, okay? I'm just going to try to look at the positive here, because I feel like if I'm going to be focusing on the negative, I might actually have a heart attack by the end of this game Because there's just a little bit too much information So you get good upgrades, glial reconstitution, you're spreading creep And honestly, for a bronze player, a very decent pace Very nice It's difficult for me to believe that both of you are actually bronze Like, this guy is micro-ing quite well It's getting glaves now after a Templar archives This strategy really doesn't make a lot of sense from the Toss either 14 drones got produced at once by the Zerk here. And honestly, the injects have been somewhat okay because there were a lot of larva available So it's just nothing is being done with these injects and quite frankly nothing is being done in general, I feel like I'm just going to first person this for a little bit I'm just curious what's happening here Like you're spamming a lot of hotkeys Wait, am I not following your screen? Sometimes I'm not sure if I'm following the screen or not Okay, now I am. I think I was before already as well you just didn't move it let's check the APM yes 80 is 100 just looking around making sure everything's okay you see the lack of workers on your third base and obviously the first thing you think of is let me get some workers on the third base what actually is happening here this is very weird to watch I feel like you're just watching things happen most of the time kind of clicking around this is how I used to play age of empires one you know me and my brother and we just look at the guys mine the woods we had a great time playing that game for hours on end just watching these guys mine woods and get like food from the sheep and stuff like that this is a very peaceful experience people don't appreciate this when they're at this level but this is the type of peaceful experience once you get better you're never going to get back you know just building stuff and enjoying seeing as like like zooming in on the evolution chamber going, oh, like, it moves when an upgrade is happening, dancing, you know? That type of stuff, it just feels so nice. I feel like both of these players just kind of are building up and having a good time playing some StarCraft too I'm not even going to blame them for that, you know Have you a good time building up your army I would, however, suggest adding a couple of drones You have a third base You want to kind of saturate that You're down in workers by quite a bit You have been down in workers for a long time. you also don't really know much about your opponent the last time you saw your opponent he was barely building a natural and had a gateway in the main base an overseer or well you even got overlord speed so you could just send in an overlord and scout even though that might be a little bit of a foreign concept for you as yeah you didn't even know how to micro and scouting usually comes after microing oh you actually do get a scouting look at that you see things you see storm what else do you see see a lot of units here, a bunch of Templar, okay? And in your head, you think, okay, that's a lot of Templar, that's a lot of gateway units. I know that the Roach is a tanky unit They can tank storms, and they're good against most gateway units, and this is actually completely correct As long as there's no amount of immortals or disruptors or some air units or maybe even colossi, roaches actually trade surprisingly well against everything that Toscan build on the ground Zellets, High Templars, Stalker, Sentry, yeah Roaches do indeed, do very well Now, when I say that they do well, I mean that they do well, if you have a lot of roaches and the other guy has a decently sized army as well, you're going to win the fight It doesn't mean you get to just absolutely stomp over your opponent. Like there's going to be trades like there is in most armies, right? So you walk in here, a couple of storms Don't forget that storm also is quite fine again Like, it's not a bad spell against roaches Roaches are very clumpy You can hit, like, 12, 13 roaches with a single storm And if the Roach player stays in the storm, Storm is actually a decent counter against it Like, I think if I were to control this army, I could definitely beat this one Like, a couple of forcefield, a couple of storms, and then you just aim of your way to victory, in my opinion Now, of course, there is two upgrades. But I'd still suggest, even if you're playing against such a gateway-focused, army to eventually transition out of this And you could transition into many different things, but as you're already getting the range upgrade, lurker could be a good suggestion here, you know You're going to get your two-two upgrades, your three-three upgrades, add in a couple of lurkers and an army that has no immortals whatsoever It's just going to get completely blasted here Now, this is good control out of you, honestly I like this control You're moving back and forth, you know, the kiting There's a lot of creep There's actually a lot of creep. There's actually a lot of even though nothing has happened and sure you had a lot of time I appreciate the creep spread I mean you're actually just kind of winning this game you can fight this army as an interesting pile I'll see it again yeah it's so good show to me one two This is like the guys in a protest and when like the riot police shows up, they're all the way in the back They have like this small tiny rock and they accidentally throw it into the floor onto themselves, you know? This by all did nothing, but I still appreciate that you tried, you know You were there, Mr Reveger Appreciate it my friend A job well done if you ask me. Now the toss is going to attack into you without plus two That is obviously a mistake This is a nice, nice concave These were good bios It seems like your control with this army is honestly not that bad After I saw what you did with the links in the early game, let's just say that I wouldn't have signed up for your army if I had the chance You're also still lacking workers in a very big way Like no extra gases You're just down in income by a lot Like you're just mining a lot less Your army also is less valuable than your opponents, but I think your upgrades largely will make up for that. like you're down about 800 gas or so and gas often is very important in arreys because gas units tend to be spellcasters and expensive units that do well in fights i also feel like that your max out is a little bit slow like i remember that back in the day in wings of liberty a 12 minute max out was fast but that was off of a six-worker start nowadays people can max in like seven minutes to be fair they don't max with two-two so You do have that going for you Just have a crap ton of money You have four more raveragers You could start 3-3, maybe some tech added Maybe you could do a run by or anything. I feel like you're just mainly running back and forth with these roaches, not really wanting to engage, but not really wanting to stay back either So you see your opponent You move into the storms You lose about eight, nine roaches And you retreat You build them again and you go back This is one hell of a fight I actually can't believe this is the type of game that I'm missing You borrow Okay To hue quicker, I guess I do like that as well Tunneling claws So maybe we're finally going to see some action Like we have a base here that is open to attack There's really no observer whatsoever here So tunneling clause could be very useful. Let's see if these roads are going to be able to do something now Have we had any fights yet? Okay So far the fights have been. in favor of the Zerk every fight that has happened in total resources lost heavily or heavily yeah kind of heavily it's almost double heavily in favor of the Zerk this is a really bad engagement for Toss so far good Biles as well and good control out of the storms I I do like that a lot and once again you're even though your army was probably a little bit weaker and still is a little bit weaker especially gas wise the way the Toss is fighting is a little bit debatable with the storms everywhere he's still going to be trading out some units against you but I think in general if you don't lose all of these roaches this probably was another good fight for about an equal fight about an equal fight I think this was not bad not great it was fine you're gonna end up cleaning up so you'll get like plus 2,000 or something like that hamster will have that on the screen I'm sure so so far actually your army has been very cost efficient against this Like, especially if this guy keeps sending in units like this. And you're also up in supply Your opponent does have more money in the bank and still has more income because both of you are on four bases, but you are mining off of, well, two bases total Half a patch here, or half a base here, half a base here, and then one base here This one's highly oversaturated So there was two base economy against about three and a half base economy, if we include the gold as well Then you attack into someone who is messing stalkers I think you can just straight up kill your opponent here You just have way more army. You have 35 roaches with 2-2, soon to be 3-3, and your opponent only had 10 stalkers, but instead you're just waiting here I do think you have a bit of a timing here I really do believe that You can just fight this But instead you're just going to be chilling on the creep I wonder what you're doing Let's open the APM tab again Okay, so you have 150 You have 200 average APM Holy crap you're fast I love watching this This is so peaceful He's just doing things, but he's clicking very fast I'd love to see the actual first person, like where he's clicking, because he must just be like spamming buttons or something This is good It's a good fight. You can fight this 100% You can kite back and fight this You do need to kite back. little bit but even if you don't I think you're gonna get a good trade you're fighting three three against two two and that a couple of moves here reminded me of the initial Zurgling micro where you attack you move back but you don't really attack and you're gonna get cleaned up here I think overall you ended up with a semi positive trade still your opponent just had a pretty big army there so like you're you're gonna trade out something at some point in your life you know I'd really recommend here getting about 20 more drones so you go up to 78 80 drones take a fifth pace really get that eco buzzing and then transition into something different so far you've only really built one unit that's the roach you built six links six links and you've lost 135 roaches and seven ravagers so far and you remaxed on 31 new roaches well it's not really remaxing because you're very far from being maxed Your opponent's about to get plus three as well. And once your opponent gets plus three, sure he's down in carapace or in armor upgrades, but it's not that big of a deal with ProDos most of the time If you, again, Zirk, if you don't have shield, shield and armor Because it's not like roaches have a very high rate of fire So the armor would be nice, but it wouldn't be absolutely game-changing If you're playing against Marines or maybe even Hydras, that would be a little bit different. But in this case, like i said it would be nice to have but it's not game changing see that you're going into malay upgrades and more queens as well getting some trades i wonder why the rest of your army is it feels like your your supply doesn't quite match with your check there's nine queens somewhere this probably was the first fight which wasn't that great for you so far oh a burrow i like that you can also burrow the drones oh roaches get rallied in i mean Yeah, this fight wasn't absolutely brilliant, and you're probably decently far behind, especially considering that your opponent keeps expanding and actually sends probes as well to the outside basis, and has just constantly been outmining you. Like, I don't think I've ever in my entire life seen a game where a Zerk builds mass roaches and actually is up 6K in units lost Like the roach, the description of the roach in my mind is a very respectful. placeable unit that is inefficient but quite strong especially in the early to the midgame it's good for staying alive that's what the Roach is for and it can be used in certain all ins you're using it as a core unit well you're using it at everything it's a support a core a carry what else do you have in these mobas you're just everything at once you're juggling as well my friend like you're going hem with this Roach but eventually I would suggest switching out not because you're not trading efficiently but because you could trade even better against the mediocre army that your opponent is building if you would be going into Broodlords Ultralisk if you had the upgrades I have to add that Broodlords Ultralisk or Lurkers you would completely destroy him like you turn these fights where you do have superior your upgrades and you tend to have pretty decent numbers and okay micro against a bad army composition which the Protoss quite frankly has like mass Archon Zealot is just a bad army composition it also isn't what you said you said it was mass Stalker this guy hasn't been building that many Stalkers lately this is good control by the way by you very nice control out of the Zerg i do like that a couple of Roaches taking out these Zealots you know i think this was a very good fight so far for you even though you were down in army supply once again i think you're actually going to really get a head out of this or well get a very good trade you're never going to get ahead because you're down 25 workers so no matter what happens you're always going to lose um in the long run no matter how efficient you're going to be trading i also like that there was like nine Queens with a bunch of transfuses just standing around doing nothing but they are going to get used now i really want to be up 8k in units lost playing pure Roach pure Roach Queen please use some transfuse it's fine you don't need to like you're getting good trades you just don't have any money this is not an issue with the Roach sucking or Storm or Stalkers being overpowered this is an issue with you a not transitioning out of an army which you could transition out of but more importantly it's just a complete lack of money and I don't see how you don't understand this Like, there's more factors in the game than just upgrades. It feels like you just focus so much on the upgrades and the fact that you had better upgrades that you should be capable of building anything Let me tell you this If you have 3-0 links against pure Archon with only plus one, the Archons are still going to win because Archons are just a hard counter to links You could have 3-3 links with adrenal glands. if your opponent has plus one arcons and like six Templar with storm and he manages to hit the storms on the links you're going to win as well or you're going to lose as well with the links like there is just unit counters that are better and even if you have better wait was this double spire even if you have better upgrades it doesn't necessarily mean you're always going to win the fight against people with worse upgrades unit counters the amount of units the amount of reinforcements all of these things matter so much in this game and you're kind of approaching it in a yeah only from a single angle I would say the upgrade angle which is good usually if you focus on one thing and you do that very well you can get pretty far but you're not really using the advantage well like you could be transitioning into lurkers and be doing so much more also you've never used the tunneling claws yet it really would do some damage because there's not a single piece of detection on the map I think there might be a cannon here, but nothing else. You could actually just go into your opponent's main base and completely destroy him But instead, you're just standing on creep doing nothing You're finally aware that he has five bases, but I mean, just the awareness of your opponent having five bases, it doesn't do much for you It's nice to know, but you also need to be able to do something Now your opponent attacks you again And the thing is, is that I can see you getting another okay trade here, you know? You're probably going to end up even further ahead in the trades But your opponent still has 1,700 in the bank, is still outmining you by almost double the income and just took out your gold base. So yeah, I think you once again that's slightly better in the trade Woo-hoo! Especially when it comes to army value Supply-wise, I think, is actually pretty close, but roaches are just really cheap So if you lose one, that's not a lot of units lost because they are only 75-25 Like roaches are very supply to resource efficient in a way Stalker is 125-50 and roaches 75-25 Both of them are two supplies So if the toss loses 50 supply of stalkers and you lose 50 supply of roaches, that's actually really good for you in the units lost step and overall because usually you have better mining than the toss. But in this case because you're mining so much less, It seems like your opponent can lose 50 supply of stalkers, and if he kills 30 supply of roaches, it's still going to be a fine trade because he's outmining you so hard And that's just basically what's happening here You're not doing anything I just can't believe that you're just sitting here, not doing anything with any of the tools you have You can burrow Also, you started your greater spire, but now you don't have any money to get any broodlords out I also kind of stop believing that brute lords are going to be the answer here, because your opponent now is on an army that consists of 34 stalkers. And even though stalkers aren't the greatest counter to broodlords, they can deal with them, especially if they're in small numbers, and they're not well upgraded And your broodlords would not be well upgraded So at this point, I'd maybe recommend going into some investors to catch the blink stalkers I like this run by I really do I would like it even more if there was some multitasking involved So rather than just trying to lose these, you could tunneling claws maybe out of here. that could be a possibility you have researched it after all your opponent has no detection you could have done that but you also could have given away all of your roaches I think this was one of the first fights where you actually didn't trade very efficiently I just don't understand how it is possible that for so long you can do absolutely nothing and still be in such a fine position building only roaches 24 minutes into the game just relying purely on your upgrades. I actually, I'm going to say one thing, though, I'm surprised that at the level of this game, like, I really thought that bronze was going to be way less creepsread, way more money floating, but especially the Protos when it comes to spending money, actually hasn't been bad at all He's been expanding pretty rapidly The APM was 100 The Zirk had 200 APM I'd love to see what this guy is clicking. I just want like a video of this guy playing like I want to know what's up here I really want to see this I think at this point the stalker army is simply the big no 43 stalkers to 14 roaches Yeah, it's not great It really isn't great Yeah, you're just gonna lose this fight It's just what it is nice control now out of the toss as well for the first time by the way Toss also let's be real hasn't been controlling too well You're just gonna lose everything Two broodlords? Where are your broodlers on the way? Okay, over here Yeah At this point I think. I am no expert, but I think two broodlords against 39 stalkers is going to be a very tough battle But I do appreciate the micro He's even kiting with the brood How is it possible that a guy that controlled six zirklings against eight probes and killed nothing, lost all six zirklings, then manages to kite broodlords? What is this race? What do you mean? Do we get anything else or is that it? I have max upgrades since 10 minutes And you have three attack, one shield That's true And you are winning That is also correct Because of storms F toz Because of storms? Where are you watching the same game, my friend? The unit lost step in the end says 4. 8K resources lost for the TOS, 43K for the Zerk And this is after TOS killed every last building on the map If we slightly go back into the replay, it's probably going to be even worse As we see, before all the buildings go down, it's like 11K in favor of the Zerk of the Zerk Spamming mess roaches, by the way I've never seen this in my entire life A Zerk player that is messing roaches and is up in the Yunus Lost app Just in general, Zirk being up in Yunus Lost is super rare once players go into the main, into the late game I just actually can't believe this This is so odd. And you dare, you dare complaining about the High Templar? What's wrong with you? Okay, let's have a look at it I harst them I complain about Sky Tos I got my three, three upgrades correctly You know what? We're just going to go over We're going to go over the little complaint for him, and we're going to figure out if this person lied at all I played against Protos I go 12 pool That was correct He went 12 pool And I have some damage on his eco That is debatable If pooling a couple of workers for half a minute is considered damage on eco, then everything is damage on eco mine dies, but forces away five probes from the line, that would be eco-davort. So that is a lie That's lie number one But he built Mass Stalker High Templar Yes, but not exclusively So a partial lie A lot of it was also Mass Zellat-Arcon I got my three-three upgrades before his Ground Attack 3 upgrade That was true And I built Mass Roach That was definitely correct That is a big truth and Mass Roach counter stalkers This is, this was more of a question, but I so-so, they so-so counter-stalkers, and they also counter-templers, according to him That's just not really true, I think I think if you have pure stalker Templar well-controlled against Mass Roach, the Roach player should never be able to engage because of good zoning storms And you can't really stand into it. But if both armies are max similar upgrades, I actually think the stalker Templar player would win But you know what? We'll give that to him as well They're tankie He's beating me no matter how hard I try and how much roach I build He's unbeatable He don't even get disruptors or sentry, just stalkers And that's it He won with 310 upgrade Okay He is not unbeatable Actually, at one point, you had won 60 supply against like 80 supply You could have just a-moved him at his third base He was beatable there. but also you just kept killing his army there was no issue with you killing his army there was an issue with you getting your own army back you just were lacking eco completely you just you completely misread what lost you the game you didn't even watch the replay you didn't even check any of the graph showing that his income went like straight to the sky off camera that's how high it was and your income was like like this basically it wasn't even close I know that I didn't attack his base but it's still embarrassing It was really embarrassing to watch You had good tools to harass You had tunneling claws, you had roaches Well, that's really all the tools you had. But those are good tools, as he had no detection whatsoever You didn't use it I'm sorry, I'm going to have to say it, my friend You just sucked You weren't very good at all You need to get more eco You need to get more transitions going But stick with the upgrades and your midgame micro wasn't too bad you know the roach control thumbs up for that but overall big fat suck all right that's going to be it for this episode of is it imba or do i suck if you didn't enjoy this episode don't forget to hit the subscribe button smash like and we'll see y'all next time for a new episode thanks so much for watching and bye."

        "text": "Dear Hirstam Yeah, this is not a good start, my friend At least get my freaking name right Dear Hirstam, I encountered a T on the ladder Both of us had not tried to harass each other in the early game, and I had better economic than him in the middle game Therefore, he was easily defeated by me in his first push After that, he was also beaten by me in next several engagement I tried to scout if he had any Viking, so I sent my army to his base After I saw them, I decided to make more high Templar, yet they didn't do much damage. I knew it is so stupid to produce lots of colossus after scouted Viking, but his economic, produce speed and army strength was just incredible He had less base than me I admit that his APM and micro was better than me, but with such a big economic gap and produced that much resources with just four bases, was irrational Is this imba, or I was just so sucked that don't think even though Zellet plus Arkham Plus Immortal would be better than Colossus Please taught me how to deal with such a troop better Sincerely, subscriber And his name is Columbus He's a protos player in Platinum And yes, we got another one A Chinese replay, ladies and gentlemen. You might think, hey, Columbus, didn't he go to America? But no To China he went, my friends The China, he went And we got our, this is going to be a banger The moment I see that the server is Chinese and it has more than three lines in the complaint form, I already know it's going to be fantastic I've never had a Chinese replay in my life that disappointed me That's actually true Every single Chinese replay that I've ever had was brilliant Now we're starting Now we're talking Assimulator first here Now, assimilator first is only useful when you actually go into a no scout from there. If you're going into a scout, it's pretty terrible because you're just going to be undersaturated on your minerals You don't actually want to be mining gas yet at this point Gate timing also was a bit weird Oh, my God Oh, he's mining a lot of gas already Yeah, this is not a great start So I explain this every week, and I'm going to explain it again The main resource required to increase your economy are minerals So the earlier you start mining gas, the worse it is for your economy Because probes, nexie, violence, everything that builds more economy requires minerals Nothing that builds more economy requires gas So the faster you get gas, the less minerals you have, the worse your eco is. This is how the easy AI scouts Exactly like this, at 130 I once did a beating Grandmaster with stupid stuff where I copied builds of the AI, and I had the words replays of the Easy AI And at 130 or something like that, the Easy AI sends out two probes to start scouting for proxies Now, what did Columbus see in order to do that? Columbus saw a CC first And then decided to go out with two probes, go scout the entire map All right Yeah You can see that Columbus doesn't have a lot of knowledge when it comes to StarCraft 2 CC first is the most economic opening for Terran, and it means that their first barracks is delayed. Columbus probably scouted this, had no clue that this was a CC first, and instead was like, hey, wait a second, there's no barracks up here Probably proxied Oh, this is great as well Here we go, the third gas Look at the timing here on the third gas, okay? Gas takes 21 seconds to build The Nexus is still about 35, 36 seconds away from finishing That means that Columbus' plan right now is to start long-distance mining the third gas on the natural while he's already floating 140 gas three minutes into the game I knew this was going to be They never disappoint I've never had a Chinese replay disappoint Double Robo I knew Columbus. was there to discover new areas, but he's also here to discover new strategies Two robots in the natural with a battery behind this This is the type of wall that you never see these stupid Terrans make They always use depots and cheap buildings that are easily replaceable This high-level chat protos just throws a couple of robos, the most important structure that he has, into his wall, because you know what? I'd rather lose a robot than a gateway That's some good thinking right there I'm so curious we're going to see her charged Chrono boost on that Let me note, by the way, that this war brigade didn't start immediately. We're going to go back in time a little bit, okay? Look at the timing where the This is not going to be pretty, okay? Okay, look at this, look at this Look at this Oh, 205 The cybernetics score finished Okay, 205 That means He has the money for it, okay? He has 50 minerals and 50 gas He can start his warp gate at any point during this time, okay? At any point Ooh! Starts it almost a full minute too late A full minute too late And then in order to improve the timing where Warpgate would finish, he chrono boosts it once. He's going to waste a Chrono boost on this word gate to get the Warpgate 10 seconds faster, even though he just delayed it by 60, 60 seconds for no real reason He's still 50 seconds late I mean, if you're going to be 60 seconds late, it doesn't matter anyway You're going to die against everything Just let it be Just skip warp gate altogether, you know, pretend like this was your plan If I was this guy, I would have pretended like I didn't need warp I would have started plus one error rather than this, you know? You got to stick with your guns If people call you out on your mistakes, you just double down on your mistakes rather than admitting you're wrong. Otherwise, you're never going to make it in politics Okay, it gets a robo bay as well Charge Ah, weird This is going to be a game I can feel it already I also like that he, what did he say in the? I'm going to have to check back into the, okay He was easily defeated I had better economic than him in the midgame Now, I don't quite know when the midgame starts But I have a hard time believing that my man Columbus is going to have a better economic into the midgame Okay? And let me explain this to all the slow people in the back right here Kids in the back, all right? Pay attention Hey? Listen to this. Mules count as about three and a half SCVs Okay So even though it says down here that the Protols has more workers than the Terran, the actual income is higher for the Terran because he has these bad boys that work real hard and real fast and real efficient You can also see that in the income graph, my good friend, Columbus It's not how it works, okay? More workers doesn't necessarily equal more income, especially if you're also not mining that many minerals You're getting a lot of gas You have more gas income I'll give you that But you're down 11 supply at the five minute mark, and that's not because of his race That's because you just haven't been building enough eco. Also, I'm going to be real I don't quite know what this build is out of the Tarran, opened up with four racks, then went into a factory, then into two more barracks, and then into a star port Somewhere in between there, a third Commence Center got built, but if I were to flame the Tarran here, it would be going against my principles, so instead we'll just say that his opener is also a rather special, but at least he's the one winning currently Wait Double row away, of course I'm so stupid I can't believe I never thought of this Never in my life had I considered going for an observer speed rush Without having a single observer out That is brilliant. Now, you might think to yourself, Kevin, why would someone chronobo boost out, observer speed, if they don't have any? observers yet And the answer is actually, why would anyone ever build an observer if they don't have observer speed? The question is the answer itself It just doesn't make sense If your observers are slow, why would you get them? I bet that the moment this observer speed finishes, he's immediately going to boost out an observer And if not immediately, then the next best moment. And the next best moment will be defined by Columbus as difficult for me to judge what the next best moment would be, could be in 10, 15 minutes from now, but if Columbus thinks that is the way, then we're great, this is great, by the way, look at this We're six minutes and 35 seconds into the game, and I just like to tell you guys what we have We currently have an immortal and a colossi, two robotics facilities, two robo base, a forge, a twilight, and a Templar archives We have almost our bingo card filled with buildings is complete. Hell, if the Robo Bay if we missed that the first time around, we could still strike it off on our little bingo card, but we don't have any units Skewing up a couple of bad boys See, he didn't actually need the Warbgate whatsoever He probably just built Warbgate because he saw it in replays, or like in pro games But he's like he doesn't actually like it He doesn't actually like WarpGate Seven minutes in game Not a single gate I've never seen something like this There we go The first gateway unit, seven minutes into the game And neither player has really, this guy hasn't even moved out yet This is fantastic Columbus plays like an AI. And this guy just plays like he doesn't give a crap about what's happening in the world But this is high quality stuff I like this so much Okay, we get Blink storm, a prism I think I saw an observer by the way Oh, this speed is being utilized very well here on this observer Look at that This observer started following this colossi as soon as possible As soon as it left the robo it went out It's actually insane how good all of the Chinese replays Yes, of course a robo here as well For a semi-wall I was going to say it's insane how good the Chinese replays tend to be. Like these guys just have a gift when it comes to creating memorable games Storm, plus two, blink, a third robotics facility He's like, okay, I now have two robotics facilities that aren't doing anything If I add a third one and the other two see the third robotics facility actually producing something, maybe they'll also get motivated You know, it's how people say that if you have a friend that is really into fitness, it's more likely to rub off, you know? It's a bit similar If you have a robotics facility that is doing very well and producing lots of units The other two bad boys also will get a little bit jealous I think that is kind of what Columbus is going here for. He's exploring new ways of motivating his, not only his units, but also his buildings So he has storm He has four Templar, two colossi, one disruptor, two immortals He's fighting against 61 Marines Now, I am very afraid He also mentioned the APM, by the way This indeed is a big gap That's 81 average APM against 72 He said his opponent has better micro and better APM That I do want to see We have armory on the way as well Okay, nice He's getting the building armor, the Neil Steele armor That's great as well I love this stuff This is a high-level game I am afraid here. I'm going to have to be honest that this turn is going to walk into a couple of storms I just have a feeling that we're not going to be seeing the greatest micro, okay? We have a scan here He's going to move around the army This is kind of exciting This is a scan here, make sure there's no observer Starts attacking the rocks Make sure to warn your opponent that you're coming Let's take a look at the first person here from Columbus He isn't seeing it yet Scanning the upgrades Okay, gets scanned on his army Columbus is like, ooh, he sees me now That's unfortunate Gets attacked? Columbus? Sends his army? Okay, here we go Now, this is the fight First storms. The first three storms only hitting our own units is unfortunate Of course, the opponent moved away from it very quickly as well So I don't think Columbus is the one to blame here Columbus, by the way, has negative eyesight There is rumours that there's moles that see more than Columbus in this game Okay, back to his forehead base He doesn't have object permanence He is a pigeon Not again Look at this The army moved out of his vision and he pretends it doesn't exist anymore He's an ostrich Actually sticking his head in the ground He's like, oh, army moved away What if the army had moved here or here? Do you not care? Negative map vision Absolutely negative map vision Impressive. Observer speed being put to good use, by the way, here Look at this bad boy We've been following the observer at high speeds right now My internet connection is jealous of the speeds that this observer can reach Let me tell you that much Okay, we now have a couple of Vikings Now, I remember Columbus mentioning that He felt that he built too many colossi against the fact, is it two more robos? Three more robos! And prism speed! Because he's been feeling that the speed of the warp prism that has been following this colossus, it's what's holding him back This is the reason that he's been losing That the fights haven't been going his way. Moves into a random location now? Did he get scanned or something? I heard a scan and then he started moving Okay, there's a single marine here this is a good warning though for Columbus Columbus Columbus just chases wherever he gets attacked you could send one marine here Columbus sends his entire army there then just straight A move into his natural destroy everything before Columbus realizes something happened I like that I like that okay look at this look at this this this okay this is the absolute highest level of following orders, okay? If your commander in the army tells you, guys, we're moving here, and you ask, boss, what if we encounter enemies? And the boss says, we just keep walking. Look at how this colossus looks, okay? Look at, look at how this colossus looks at this marine Look at them, look at them, look at them Oh, we see you And they still gets taken out in the end, but the idea was there Oh my God This is going to be the drop of a lifetime as well Colossus, sorry, Columbus is completely blind No clue what's going on here Now it gets this base destroyed It's going to get a massive drop into the main base How many Marines is this? You 75 Marines Okay, let's see what the response is Hopefully a recall to the correct base Oh, correct base recall Natural goes down Main base Honestly, the Terence movement is not too bad. He's going to get sandwiched though, but is that really. Oh my God, another stim Oh my God, another stim! Maybe stim one more time? He just stimmed his own units to death. Say no to drugs, guys. I'm not even sure if Storms did anything here, but. It's difficult to say what actually killed these units. Was it just himself? or was it a Storm hitting? I think it was more himself over stimming. Upgrades are good here, by the way. This is a lovely game. I really like this game. Hey, observer's feet Observer too fast for his own good. If these observers were just regular slow observers, this wouldn't have happened. Look at this. Oh Oh, all three, F2 as well. solid Protoss operator. Look at this If these guys were slow like usual, if these guys were slow like usual, they'd just be floating behind these Templar or something like that They would have survived So for the observer speed not paying off, but perhaps in the future, you're never quite now It's always possible that in the future something happens I need to resume Ship weapons Okay, we have the new steel armor still done It's lovely to see Immortal We have three immortals, four Templar I feel like there's actually a timing here in which if Columbus would decide to attack and hit like just one of his storms, that could be powerful We'll see though Okay, another miss It's so close Yeah, yeah, we hit one. Well, you know, we only had four storms and hitting one of them is better than he's done so far this game So I see this fight as an overall win for the Protos, even though he's going to probably lose this entire army I still feel like he made progress as a person, which is also important You know, personal growth In the first three fights, he hit not a single storm, unless you count hitting your own units as hitting storms And here he did hit one of the four storms So 25% That's a percentage that Columbus is going to be pretty proud of I can imagine He does have more bases, by the way. And if you consider the 15-minute mark the mid-game, he is now officially ahead in economy So as we're entering the five-based stage, or as Columbus would call it, the mid-game, he is in a fantastic spot right now economically because realistically he's still down a crap ton of money I didn't even know that's possible as Stoss He's double the units lost It's painful as well Kind of painful, but it is what it is Impressive, that's what it is Oh, look at that Four robos are being used right now I guess the two robos in the natural did end up dying May they rest in peace Where are all the robos? He adds three more four. He already finished his attack upgrades so he can only use two forges So one of the forges will be used as a backup forge If one of the others dies, then he can take over the task of the others Makes a lot of sense Four colossus being produced at the same time Where's, okay, so that's one, that's two This is three and four and this is five, of course He builds five robo units at the same time and starts his plus one ship weapons or air weapons it's called for ProDos, excuse me That also makes a lot of sense because it does feel like that the Stargate transition is imminent I mean, he already has zero Stargates and there's no fleet beacon yet. So, oh, here comes the first Stargate, two Stargates at the same time Columbus never builds buildings in once They always come in pairs Doesn't want the Stargates to be lonely Builds them close to each other Armor and Shield starting It's crazy that he starts the upgrades so quickly, but then just does nothing for the rest of the game He's just sitting, he doesn't Do you think Columbus watched the replay? Or do you think Columbus? He just looks at the mini-map at the end of the game and says, huh, weird that I lost this game My opponent only was on three base I had five, building a sixth Man, Terran Eco Taron Yuen is completely broken That's just insane. Yeah, let's have a look at this army So we're going to maybe see a nice F2 here See how this fight will go Oh, it's an A move We have no storms here We have storms in the back No storms in the back We have some storms here Okay, let's count storms Well, so far the storms haven't really been necessary There's the Coloss been doing a fantastic job Oh! That's two hits at the same spot That's better than not hitting though And one more Oh! That was a really nice fight And this guy improves quickly He went from zero hits to one hit to like three to four big hits He's kind of a hat He's winning We're winning. The Protos player is actually winning at this point Columbus is doing it Wait, how are you going to lose this game? Wait, this We're up 14 supply. We have Templar against a guy that has more air units than ground units does have three three upgrades just one storm needs to hit buddy i feel like this terran is anticipating storms and columbus is just he's just not he's just not using them he says i'm not going to use my storms mate i like that the disruptor ball got sent exactly where the zealot would have been if the zeal it was still like he just used all of his templars to morph into arkons Okay, loses the Colossus But we still have five robos Ten gateways and two stargates And there's about 1700 minerals in the bank We're fine We're mining way more than the Terran at this point This is looking solid To be honest I don't quite see how this is going to be possible to lose Oh, is this maybe where The Vikings kill Oh, he's going to go for pure Colossi Now I don't mind getting three to four Colossi but you do need some ground support with it. Fleet beacon? Like some stalkers, some Arkham, some salads or I guess some carriers or tempest he's going to go for? Okay this this attack is going to hit hard Couple more Templar What am I looking at here? Okay, the base falls The Vikings are shooting Okay, control, Viking control is not happening There's no kiting, but I think the terran actually does win this I mean, there's still 3K in the bank, which you always kind of transferred it into the cheapest unit which you could buy, which would be the zealot There would be 60 supply of zealots That definitely would have been helpful here 30 extra zealots being warped in Yes, sir That would be real nice Wasn't the case. I can't believe he lost this game though That is indeed a little bit broken I wonder how he lost the game I mean, his control was pretty decent The fights definitely felt cost efficient I just can't imagine a reason Why Columbus here would get kicked out of this game That's so odd Colossi and Immortal still stuck Is Columbus realizing? He's rallying probes into his natural right now Completely undersaturated third base, or whatever base is, sixth base Columbus decides to rally them straight into his net, which has two mineral patches remaining This is the type of high-level decision-making that stops me from reaching the top, I think. Sometimes I watch my games against Cyrilbeck and I think to myself, what could I have possibly done better here? But I think I'm getting the answers watching this Okay, it's a fort base again I like how Calmie is under all of this as well It's like, oh my opponent's still on three bases, I think I have a chance Didn't he say in his form that his opponent was on four bases? His opponent is actually on five bases And there's a planetary here Like, sure it's not a whole lot of it Sure, it's not a whole lot of bases, but it's still more than four Oh, my God He once again stormed his own zealots. Also hit some of the marauders initially, though, so not too unimpressive Yeah, and at this point you're just dead This was a fantastic game All right Holy crap Where to start? First of all, you didn't speak the truth You said you were ahead economically into the midgame, unless you define the midgame as the final part of the game you weren't actually in the midgame I decided to make more high templar, yet they didn't do much damage, is another thing you said They did do damage, but mainly on your own units So a statement that I'd consider a half truth, basically Okay, now we're going to judge you here on three things One of those, first one is going to be the map vision. Your map vision was not, existent you had no map vision you saw nothing your response to everything you did see wasn't there either so both your responsiveness to the things you saw and seeing the things you wanted to see were the worst that I've ever seen and thus you get a big fat that is absolutely terrible massive suck stamp for that one then for the second a new category invented especially for you because I do feel a bit bad for you and that is buildings You had many buildings You sometimes built the same building five times Out of the buildings you made many upgrades which weren't all useful but you did build them So for that you get a sticker. Three stars, three golden stars for you my friend Good job Keep fighting And finally, um, your unit unit control It's been a very long time, a really long time, since I've seen a protos get doubled in the unit lost step or doubling the terran in the units lost, while the terran is on mass marine marauder fighting against Colossus Templar I'm not even sure how this is possible It is actually very difficult to do as a protos And I am impressed, appalled, and I want to shoot myself all at the same time So for that you get a massive truly atrocious stamp, especially hamster crafted stamp. Dish! On that one, put all three of these together and what do we get? My friend, Taron is not imbalanced You just freaking suck All right, that's going to be it for today's episode of Is It Inba or Do I Suck?

        "text": "Dear Harstam, Zirks' ability to reproduce lost economy and the Nye Scouting is insane, exclamation mark Playing against Zirk feels so coin flippy, and it's discouraging that the only way to win his pro-lose against Zirk is with a two-base all-in or boring Skytos This Zirk never did run-bys or split his army, except for borrowing Lurker so he could still use Zirks' beloved F-2 key In this game, I scouted that he went super-fast hatch with a quick pooling gas Because my probe can scout the Zirkspace, I had the plan for both a link flood and for a roach ravager bust I can't scout which one it is because the adept would just get killed by speedlings, and then I just died to a link flood. So I went Voidrace, and his roach ravager bust was a complete failure Because I couldn't tell whether he was following up with drones or more roaches and ravagers, I decided to go DT as it could punish both a hatchet, queen walk, and stop another bust All of these decisions were pure guesswork as I couldn't scout with my void race, lest my third gets destroyed by a ling flood I pick off the sand of mutas, and I decide to go Phoenix It turns out I'm right, and he suddenly shows up with 20 mutas Had I guessed hydras, I would have been dead right there Noticing he didn't go spores, I counter-attacked with DTs, hoping to buy time for Phoenix to come out. I then proceed to kill about four mineral lines, worse of drones No problem Four S D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d Those are these He means that he pressed the four-button control group hotkey, which is usually where the hatchery is, then as for select larva, and then press the D-button many times Now, it probably just held down the D-button once, but I understand what he's saying He should have been dead there, but I couldn't kill him, but I couldn't kill him, because he my anti-air was too undeveloped I kill hatcheries everywhere, but he just seemed to have infinite economy He even goes ultras, all caps, against the ground proto's army, exclamation mark Yet he still wins despite all of this. After being so inactive with his muras, losing four mineral lines to DTs, losing another 60 odd drones to run bys, as towing everywhere and going ultras, he should have been dead as dirt, but nay, exclamation mark, please, Captain, this is totally imba Is it? Or do I suck? Question mark This is a great little form here as really, this is kind of how most stories get told, you know? Whenever you're telling a story and you're upset about something, you always leave out the things that you did, you know? It's like, yeah. So the other day, I was just having dinner with March and all of a sudden, out of nowhere, she just threw a glass of wine in my face, leaving out the part where you joint an entire lobster straight onto her plate, and then started throwing chairs into the air, make them into a header just to land into her food as well So I feel like we're lacking a big part of the story here All we've seen is brilliant moves out of the person called Probius Corp, who is of course a Protos and his masters on the NA server and the Zerk just being a little idiot Now, this sounds pretty unlikely to me. I have to say already at this point, if I read a complaint form like this where the Protos does everything correct and the Zerk does everything wrong, and this guy is hard-stuck-in masters, I'm already thinking, I doubt that you did everything correct, my friend, but, you know, as always, I am very open-minded to the possibility Just perhaps a little bit more skeptical than I usually am just because of how his complaint for him was worded and You know the structure of it with him being the complete hero and the Zerk being the complete idiotic villain So yeah, I'm curious to see what's going to happen here. Oh, look at that 14 hatchery Now this is a cool little move here out of Yeast was a nice name as well I like that yeast And this is for sure is going to confuse the mediocre-minded protos player, but of course not Probius Corp, as he is definitely not mediocre-minded, at least not what he wants us to believe Now, the 14 hatchery, worse economically than the 16 hatchery, means you get the hatchery before the overlord This allows you to always get the hatchery down before the nasty protoz comes over and blocks that hatchery with the probe, forcing you to take this base, as you're natural or dis-base as you're natural. So actually a pretty cool little move, something that a lot of pro players did for a while The problem is because it's worse than 16 hatchery If the Protos decides to go for a no scout, you're just in a bit of a bad spot as a Zirk, because you're sacrificing a bunch of eco But it's definitely playable and it makes the games very consistent because you always open up with this hatchery over here Now on top of that he follows it up with a very fast Actually, this is really rapid speed So, yeah, this speed is going to finish at what, the 310 mark? And straight Roachhorn So I like this build order here out of yeast, honestly I'm a big fan. Now, technically the Protos could have scouted it, but it is really tight with the link timing And, I mean, he just gives up the probe for free now I kind of understand what he's saying, okay? I kind of understand what he's saying Now, I have a word of advice here for all tosses around the world and also for probius score If you're afraid of a cheese and you're not sure what it's going to be, a really cool thing that you can do is rather than letting your probe die for free on the ramp, which might have seemed like a good decision at a time You're like, oh, you see a ramp It's a nice burial site for this probe. I could just let it die here to the two links that never would be able to catch it if I just send the probe over here Rather than doing that, what you could do is you could actually send the probe over here It stays alive, you move down to the tower, then you check this third base, and then you check this third base And even though you're not going to get any direct confirmation that it is indeed going to be an all-in, what you can get is indirect confirmation that your opponent, or well, direct confirmation that your opponent is stuck on two bases because he doesn't have a third base. If there's no third base, the likelihood of their being an all-in does kind of increase On top of that, he wasn't sure whether it was going to be a roach al-in or a lingal-in, because he was afraid he would die to link speed The beauty with the probe is that you can kind of run around, being chased by links, in front of your opponent's base Imagine if it would still be alive, that probe, right? It would just be here Link speed isn't being built right now because yeast went for straight roaches this means that your probe just would have seen these roaches move out, right? And if it would have seen link speed, it would have seen link speed. So you would have gotten to see it Sure, you would have lost the probe, but you also lost the probe now and you got no information So rather than just losing the probe without anything, you get some info for it And that can only be a good thing in my mind. And I also think if you're playing against two base, if he would have scouted that it was just two base, getting a Shield Battery and going into Stargate is always a safe play and will always what is this holy crap what is this wall getting a Stargate always will allow you to stay alive with a Shield Battery just make sure you try to have a super battery alive as well and that would definitely help oh this is brilliant oh I've never seen this before but look at this he can basically play musical chairs here with the wall and where the biles are, he'll just walk to the different wall. I don't think this was done on purpose, but this is actually kind of useful in this type of situation Like, he could, he gets bile here, he just walks to the next wall Well, he doesn't do that, but he could have done that, in theory That is actually pretty cool Also, that first void ray is pretty late I don't know why, but it's just late by 15 seconds or so Of course, he's still going to hold really easily, because let's be real, he has a full wall, he had a battery Quick tip, by the way, when you see this orange marker that doesn't indicate a spot where you need to move your units. That actually indicates the spot where the bile, these things that are now going up in the air, will fall down into, okay? So try to move your units away rather than to stack as many on the same spot as possible It's just a quick tip there for all the tosses well, everyone really out there So he did it correct with the stalker, but the adept just stayed there It's a little bit of a mistake Another thing also is that usually you want to focus on one units rather than trying to kill all roaches and ravergers at the same time, by making sure they all get red health. One of the main things in Starcraft is to lower your opponent's damage output as fast as possible And a good way to do that is to focus units, one by one, especially if there's very little units Because the longer they stay alive, the more damage they get to do, obviously I like that he finished a pylon here There's no real use, but still, you know, extra safety You can never be safe enough This is a double bagger We can feel it already, you know? This is a double bagger I've never actually seen someone doubleback I've heard people speak of double bagging, but I've never seen it in real life yet. Maybe I should move to whatever Probeus Corps is living because I just stake out the local grocery store And, ah, there we have him Do Voidreys do find the overlord? Also, I'd like to note that despite the fact that Probeus Corps completely stopped this push without taking massive Well, he took some damage He still is probably not in a brilliant spot, right? He sure has some map control with these Void Race His opponent is getting a double expansion a lot of money in the bank There's 47 workers Like, it's not super brilliant And I think this is because he wasn't producing workers all the way throughout His third base never really got started quickly afterwards either He still full walled out himself. And probably was loading a fair amount of money during that push as well I didn't see it, but I can only imagine because otherwise he would have had more crap at this point I also feel like there might have been a couple a probe cuts because it doesn't seem right that he only has 44 workers six minutes into the game Did he lose any workers? He lost two So technically you should have 48 Now, I'm pretty sure you can have like 58 at this point, maybe even 60 I think I'm actually fully saturated at six minutes, but at my third But we'll, you know, we'll leave it for now We'll leave it for now. I'm not going to put the bar too high here We are dealing with an American and we're dealing with a master's player and these two in combination are can be very dangerous they're actually the most dangerous kind of american the american master because they they have to believe that they understand the game so they start making their own builds and their own shenanigans you know and before you know they invade another country again so you're always got to be uh you got to be very very careful here with the american masters okay charge being researched forge is here as well well, I like these things I genuinely do like these things This is good play We're lacking some obvious vision. This is one of the themes that came back in the balanced complaint forms This was a thematic, thematic, yeah, thematic complaint form I had a lot about the lack of scouting and the ability to reproduce That's mainly what it was about And Protos doesn't have an easy time scouting, but we do have a couple of tools for scouting And none of these tools are three void rays and six adapts Now, the tools are an observer, hallucination, and an oracle And Phoenix, I'll also count And in the early game, an adept, you can use it He didn't build any of these and then started complaining about scouting This is like not inventing radar. And I'm complaining that you don't know whether planes are coming or where the boats are You know, like it just doesn't make a lot of sense Like just invent radar technology It's not that difficult, my friends Bats have the same as well I've actually once heard a story This could be completely fabricated So take this with a grain of salt Most of the things I say are completely fabricated I once heard that the American military, the guys who made the radar technology, couldn't believe that bats also were capable of doing similar things because it was such sophisticated technology that they wouldn't allow it They were like, there's no way this is true That was the story I know it wasn't very good. These two void rays also aren't doing a very good job They now went into the main base, lost one of their brothers, then started focusing an extractor, and then as it almost died, swapped onto one of the queens that got transfused by his friends So, wait, didn't this guy say that he sniffed out the mudas? I'm gonna have to read this again What did you say? Control F I pick off the scent of Muras and decide to go Phoenix Did he have a Phoenix before this already? He had one Phoenix already Okay Yeah He had one Okay I'll give you that Decide to go Phoenix Okay I can feel that To be fair, having a blind phoenix is always good. For a second, I thought that he, when he said picking of the scent, he meant I got attacked by Muralis This is like getting mauled by a bear and then going, I'm picking up the scent of a bear I feel like I should get my bear spray out But no, he actually already had a phoenix out You know what? You win this one, Probeus score You beat my analogy Before it even got out of my mouth I love this T run by That this is a banger This is great Sends in 70 T's Imagine just having the money to spend on 70 T's. Then you know you've been a good saver, you know? It's like when I was a young boy, I had saved a lot of money, me and my brother together And then once the Game Boy Color got out, we could buy it together with Pokemon Silver And we felt very good about herself Probeius Corps managed to do the same thing now He just warped in 70 T's when he needed to them the most He was like, damn, that's a cool Game Boy color I can buy that And he is, there's a cool 70Ts Let me just warp them and run them across the map He's actually doing a crap ton of damage. My favorite part of all of this though is not the fact that he could afford 70 Ts or the fact that he killed like infinite workers No, it is that during all of this, he didn't build any more phoenixes So first he picked off the scent of phoenixes, remember? He smelled them, then he was getting mauled by Muraas as he moved across the map And then as his DTs were keeping his opponent busy, he decided that the best course of action was to completely idle my Stargate for the next minute and just start working, start building immortals instead. Because the thing that we really need, if there's only flying units on the map, is a unit that deals well with ground units that are armored That is just a brilliant call and this is the type of call you don't really see anymore past the American Masters level I did a good job at the IRS, you know, I'm going to give you that You're in a fine spot Starts once again You have cannons, batteries Good setup No fort base, by the way My man is on 80 workers Fantastic economy He is outmining his opponent because he just killed like 50 workers, but he's on three bases Now, very often if you have 80 workers, you might want to consider getting a fort base. As right now, most of your probes are just doubling onto your third Like, you actually double saturated almost It's impressive Fort base goes down You lose every single Phoenix to the muralists Like, phoenixes are good against muralists, but you do need to control them, which What do you think that stalker was thinking, as his friends were just standing around, admiring the unbouldable rocks Okay, boys, how about you help me as well? I like this counter Do I like this counterattack? I actually don't like this counterattack at all No It's a counter attack that is meant to kill workers because there's no ground units. But because there's no ground units, five zealots would have done probably the exact same thing, except in that case you wouldn't have lost the stalkers I'm also impressed by Probius here that he can warp in, what is it, like 20 stalkers without getting blink or without starting blink and just kind of using them as a stupid zealot Like, so far they haven't really achieved much of anything After realizing that his Phoenix control isn't quite what it used to be back in the day, just on a fleet beacon to get the range upgrades, I approve of that move I approve of that move I feel you as well with your Phoenix micro not being what it used to be. honestly you've done a lot of damage but you've also thrown away a lot of armies at this point and you haven't really transitioned into an army that is great at dealing with large numbers of mutas except at least not with the control that you've been showcasing so far so yeah i'm not a massive fan of everything so do you have plus one I wouldn't mind plus one either on the phoenixes at this point it tends to be very very useful Your control here is quite good I have to admit as well You're controlling this well You really are Also as there's no spores yet, I wouldn't mind seeing like a single DT being sent by. Very often in lower levels, people believe that DTs are only useful when you warp in 12 But actually if you send a single DT to a base without any detection, you're most likely going to get a lot of workers anyway And often what's better is to split DT tease up rather than to send all of them to the same base You see, these two bases do have detection, but the outside bases don't 74 workers once again for the Zerk So the Zerk actually is macroing up while he's playing He's doing quite a good This is a very good run by Well, okay The idea behind it was very good Okay This is the, okay. When I said, this is a very good run by I didn't know you just walk straight into your opponent's vision This is like if Frodo were on his way to Mount Doom, and the entire time he's just screaming, I have the ring Hello, I have the ring Like, this is not really how it's supposed to go You know, Lord of the Rings would be a very different movie if that was the case If Frodo had like 12 IQ, you just literally walk through a watchtower to attack this base I like the idea, though, of sending out rumbis against Muralist Ling because it forces the Muralist to come home because Lings don't trade to well against salads very often. So, of course, there's some hydros there as well, but they have crappy upgrades Unless there's like roaches or banlings, salads tend to trade pretty well by themselves You don't even really need to pay attention to it I like this move Once again, I would have preferred to see them split or just to have one send in, but it's not necessarily a bad move At this point, the Zerk is actually, I think, slightly ahead It's because he's been trading better and because he's actually been mining multiple bases most of the time Like the Zirk before this happened, actually I think was in a good spot Even though it seems like all of the things the Zirk did kind of fell flat. But he did do some damage and he kept you on three base for a long time So the game is, I think it's honestly kind of evenish at this point Upgrades are fine for the Zerk Yeah, I really don't mind this too much Do you have the range upgrades yet? Okay, you have Any Impulse I still wouldn't mind seeing a plus one upgrade here You don't have a cybercore, do you? Yeah, you don't It wasn't in the front It died, and then you never rebuilt it Okay Makes some sense Now, at this point, as your opponent is transitioning into a more Ling Bain style, I'd recommend getting Storm You're getting a Templar archives It's a good thing I do enjoy the Trobeus Corps. The game slows down a little bit here You get a very big zealot army I'm not even sure how that's possible that you have this many zealots in an army Why do you have so? little gas Okay, well, you're not mining from this gas That doesn't help Maybe you were late on the gases on the fort as well You were pretty late They just started mining Now, whenever you have zealids in your army and your opponent has banlings, you kind of got to think of how these armies interact with one another, okay? Like, if you have 30 zealots and they're fighting 10 banlings, you're not going to trade well. Like, most likely all your zealots will die and all of his banings will die If you have five zealots and he has ten banlings, all of your zealots will die and all of his banlings will die as well So what we learn here is that in order to get rid of banlings, it's best to not run in with big clumps of units that are easily splashed upon Run bys are a very good tool, especially run bys that go unspotted Now, once again, I do appreciate you announcing where you are, but you're straight up walking into towers, but this does make it lot easier to get spotted So try to send one unit to a tower first. I also, in theory, I like this move, okay, where you send a runby to the right side and then push a different spot, a different location However, as your first runby got completely blasted, right now the Zirc can just actually send this entire army to deal with this force And let's be real, this force isn't the biggest force I've seen in my life Especially, against banlings, it is really tricky to fight with heavy zealot compositions So you see the banlings just trade so darn well against zellets And then the hydras should be capable of cleaning up the rest of your army This is a good run by if it was doing anything. What's going to happen is, look at this, he realizes his main army died He's going to pay attention to the mini map in 15 seconds from now Oh, he just did And now he sends it in After his entire army died, once again, allowing the Zerg to respond to it without having to deal with any other threat This is what I call fake multitasking This is setting up groups of run bys, but only using them after your other thing that you were controlling died or has pulled back It is completely useless because the main thing about multitasking or about having multiple groups attacking at the same time is that it's really difficult to split off in the moment. Like, it's just extremely difficult for all races This is true across the board But also really for Zerk, because you have a complicated army Look at this army This is an army that right now is Lurker, Hydra Ling Like, if there's 10 zealids here, what do you send there? Do you want to have a lurker there? Can you just send, like, what, 20 lynx and five hydras? It's probably not enough You need to send a decent amount By the time that these units arrive, this base might have gone down already as well it's difficult to split an army. However, if there's just 10 zealots there and the rest of the army just got killed, you go, well, I just sent my entire army there Like, nice, you know, it's all good So when you're trying to do runbys, try to at least have them semi-synchronized, you know Something you can do, if you're struggling with this, this is going to be a hot tip here, okay? Listen to this hot tip as you storm your own observer and your own zealots do manage to win this fight Holy crap, you have a lot of Templar This was a good fight for you I almost glossed over my whole tip, but I'm going to give it after this fight, okay? Don't go anywhere. Okay, listen to this whole tip Imagine you have a main army here, which you do, okay? And you want to start pushing into this area, but you know you have crappy, you have crappy control of multitasking or just of your army in general So you only need to focus on your army What you can do is you can just rally five zealots with a massive attack move command And you just go on the mini map, you go like A move, A move, A move, A move, and you just aim move a couple of things And you make sure that the run by arrives while you are fighting. So you send a runby from here pretty far away, and it will take like 20 to 30 seconds And you just start moving to the watchtower and you start doing things like clearing a bit of creep, throwing a storm on this army And then while you're fighting, your Zellat Rambai arrives And the Zellet Rambi will take care of stuff, you know, by itself Like, Zellis are really good while they're not being microde They're even better while they are being microed A lot of top Protos player will make you believe that that's not the case and that when you leave Zellets alone, they do their best job. You know, they don't want to be those micro-managers, but it's completely fine to just let them work by themselves Just aim off in a certain pattern and then start controlling your main army It's not really multitasking, but it is. a run-by and it is it is a setup that works really well very often what I see is that people send in the run-by first gets cleaned up and then after they see that a run-by died they start moving in with their main army so like this is exactly the type of move that I was talking about this is brilliant except this could have just been salads salads are really good when not controlled these are even better but dTs are super expensive and they're kind of similar to to salads anyway you know they're a ground unit that probably doesn't escape so you rather have cheap units On top of that, the Zerg is on 98 workers, is mining a creptone of money, and the resources lost is still pretty close. So you do really need to start doing some damage And now you see your DTs are starting to do some damage They take out the base Zerk needs a split of units This is annoying for the Zerk If right now you would be moving forward here, I think you could just pretty much blast this little army that is here It's what five lurkers You have an observer You have a creptone of zealot You could lift two of these one of these lurkers look, he's really struggling with it This is what I'm talking about Run bys are just difficult to deal with because you don't quite know what is there or what is going to be there in the future. Your army composition also sucks You need a second robotics facility for more immortal production against the Lurker Ultra Army, which is not really an army This is always so funny to me when people complain about, oh my good Lord What was that fight? There was no support there It was just lurkers This is why I sent one unit to the tower first If there's lurkers there, they'll show themselves Oh my god Well, painful Painful I wonder how you lost this game Good Lord It was like 50 supply there for free You're like half a lurker Okay, anyway, what was I gonna say? I had a good thought in my head Right. I think you complained about the fact that he goes ultras against a ground Protos army What an idiot Now, this is the type of argument where you actually own yourself It is a complete self-own If he manages to kill your army with Ultras, even though you have a full ground army, it is probably your army composition that sucks even more How can you not understand that? Like, if you have an army that consists of mass Templar, zealad Arkon, and almost no immortals, and you die against Ultras, then you can't say, what an idiot for being Ultras No, you're the idiot for not building enough immortals Like, it's a complete self-own. And the fact that you didn't realize that makes me doubt that you actually have double-digit IQ Phoenix comes home, I like that Like, you can say a lot about this Zerk, but this Zerk is making place He really is Attacking, left, right and center, different unit compositions He doesn't have to at all This is a run-by He's been doing run-bys He's been splitting of his army when he is been getting harassed Like, this Zerk has actually been playing quite well Sure, his creep friend wasn't brilliant Some of his fights have been mediocre His dealings with harass hasn't been perfect, but he's kind of outplaying you, my friend. And so far, the only person that actually dealt with harass by splitting of units actually was this Zerk player You say that he kept F2ing, but you have freaking phoenixes and observers all in the same move command Like, yeah, you're not F2ing, though, because the phoenix sometimes flows behind I'm not even sure we're still controlling the phoenix at this point I do like the dedication to your army, but I say just let it patrol some area and pretend you forgot about it, you know? You don't want to be controlling a phoenix when you're fighting a ground army like this Once again, slightly too many zealots, so you want to split off like seven or eight off Go to this base. Once again, Zirk splitting off part of his army to go for her ass It's looking quite good Honestly, the Zerk is pretty decent I really do believe the Zerk is pretty decent This base You have too little immortals You have too many zealads Not enough Arcons really either Sure, you don't have a lot of money That's because you also haven't been expanding enough You also have pretty poor map vision this entire game I don't think you won managed to occupy a tower Now you get chased by ultras, lurkers, banings Good fight by you though Really nice storms Pretty decent target fire as well with the immortals And you manage to conserve most of your zealads. So after a fight like this, rather than always send you DTs across the map, just go for like a five Zelladromb, I just go like bang, bang, bang You know, on the mini map, I just pink that You just boom, go to that watch tower and then you walk into that spine and you don't even really have to look at it Just go for it, man Meanwhile, while you're doing that, you take the gases here, you probably have to take another base because currently you have 49 workers on this base Now, I am a person that does like oversaturation every now and again, but this is pushing it even for me And you give up this base. Because, okay, who is F2ing now, baby? Who is F2ing now? What is this? So he sees two lurkers here And he sees three lurkers here And I think this was a response to the lurkers over here, actually Now he pulls away the works He's like, oh crap, I'm out of position I think he pulled himself out of position and then pretended like he wanted to give up this. build because at this point in his mind he's already hatching the plant to send us into iotis i can feel it i've got kind of a a six cents for that at this point well i already have a regular six cents so more of a seventh sense i would say now his army is still quite dangerous yeah it's a pretty big army um however the zirk army is just a lot larger and not just a lot larger I think at this point more stuff just beats less stuff There's 14 Ultralisks against four immortals This Zerk could probably fall asleep at his keyboard and still win this game at this point And he isn't falling asleep That's the beauty of this. It's not falling asleep whatsoever He's just A moving across the map and he's going to take you out That's absolutely brilliant Hop Hop, good control out of you, by the way You're micro in these fights it's really not that bad It's, you know how to keep an army alive This fight that you just took, honestly, I kind of like that Your control in general hasn't been too bad It's just the decision making of where to fight and what army and where to fight with what part of your army Like very often the zealots are in the wrong place. You had a really bad fight over here where you just kind of didn't pay attention for 10 seconds or so, but that happens to the best, you know I once remember there was a clip on Reddit where an entire Zerk army got nuked by a Terran And there was one guy in the comments who said, this is why Terran is so ridiculous You don't pay attention to your army for 30 seconds and just like that you lose the game And at first I was like, yeah, that is kind of ridiculous And I was like, wait, what? Probably if you don't pay attention to your army for 30 seconds, surely you deserve to lose the game. Like, what kind of idiot are you to not pay attention to your army for 30 seconds? And I feel like, that's not kind of what happened here with that fight, you know? At first I'm like, you know, that's tricky Lurkers are pretty good I'm like, wait, you saw that fight going south for like five or six seconds already And you're just sitting there and like, oh, that seems pretty all right Good kiting Really nice kiting with these immortals The Zirks engagements haven't really been that hot And you're actually doing a fantastic job You're making this game close and I'm impressed Like, okay, this is good You're actually, unit lost is probably, yeah, it's going into your favor now. It actually is going into your favor Ooh, that was a bad recall You could have gotten this I think you're just afraid of lurkers I, too, would be afraid of lurkers I've seen you engage into them Nice Pulls the probes back as well I like it No mining, though Which is why I didn't like the recall Because you're really worried working with a situation where things are getting worse and worse for you, right? And your opponent just gave you an opportunity to pick off four lurkers for free, and you decided to pass it on so you could go back home That's not really the way it's supposed to be I can assure you that It's not the way it's supposed to be. Now you're doing a salad run by, but this is not the time anymore Just keep your army together, my friend I think this is going to be kind of the final fight These lurkers actually should be coming home at this point These should be coming home too Sirk is still mining though Sirk actually needs to be really careful He really could lose this Yeast Oh, the Lurker flank I like that I like that move Yep And now with the Ultras in the back Okay Yeah, this is going to clean it up finally So Tuls does end up dying A painful debt I mean, no income still And we have a base here We have another base going up here Lurker defense there. I love it having 14 workers and 4 on 1 gas that's big especially because you already have 1500 gas i like that move i do like that move a lot come on prob you it's over like okay this is just a little bit pathetic and it's wasting my time like what is this you know your opponent still has a base and is mining you have two immortals you know the other guy has lurkers hydras and ultras and you have two immortals like do you do you really do you really really believe this is going to work. Like, actually, do you truly believe that with these two immortals, you can do what you couldn't do with five immortals and two zealads? It is just so difficult for me to understand this type of behavior You're going to camp at the cannons while you're long-distance mining with seven probes Like, you must have dropped out of like third grade mathematics or something if you don't understand that your opponent is out mining you Like, you need to go There's been a freaking type timer on top of your head for the past eight minutes, and you're pretending that it isn't there Like, the bomb has already exploded Your limbs are off It's time to die now, my friend Yeah, Gigi, probably your score leaves the game. Okay, so your main concerns here, your main problems were with the service ability to reproduce lost economy and deny scouting Okay? Well, to reproduce lost economy, yeah, Zirk is pretty decent at reproducing lost economy They can rebuild anything very quick That is something that is inherent to the Zerk race, and it's one of the reasons why they're capable of being competitive If they would be like the other races, they wouldn't be capable of being competitive because their units are just a lot worse They need that ability This is what kind of makes it balanced Like, on top of that, it's not like he actually got a heading economy He got a heading bases. You were up in workers for the majority of the game The problem was you were on three bases while having 80 workers, or on four bases while having 85, well, two of them are already mined out You were just way too slow with expanding The problem here wasn't so much with the worker count It was with the base count And when it comes to the base count, what is stopping you from taking? taking extra basis Nothing So on that point, on the reproducing lost economy, I'd say, yes, they're fast at it, but that wasn't the issue You missed the issue here Like, the issue was the basis, not the drones. So on that, I'm going to give you a big fat, no, a deny Then when it comes to denying scouting, well, he didn't even really try to deny scouting so much as you're just giving yourself like these mental blocks where it's like oh there might be speed or there might be Roaches and i can't figure out what it is sometimes you don't need to figure out what it is you just need to figure out what it is not it was not a third base so building a Shield Battery is fine and getting a Void Ray is fine you did those two things and you survived like you would have survived against both the Ling flood and against the Ravager so why are you complaining. Like, that part of the game went very well for you That was probably one of the only parts in the game that went very well for you It's discouraging that the only way to win as Protost against Zurich is with a two base all in or boring Skytos This game could have been win in like a million different ways As they say, all roads lead to Rome, except perhaps the road that you picked because that one led to Atlantis Like, you're dead under the sea, my friend I'm not sure what you were doing, but you never. to rebuild your cybercore after it got taken out at like the 14 minute mark against Muralisk, which didn't allow you to build a second robo to pump out more immortals, which was the one unit that would absolutely would have won you the game Your army composition in general was way to sell it heavy because you were lacking that gas from a fifth base, a faster fourth base So you kind of dug your own grave, build your own coffin, then jumped in the coffin and laying in your grave, and then all of a sudden you're surprised that you find yourself in a grave, in a coffin It's like, well, this is what you did, my friend. Well, like, I can't help you anymore from here on now Like, the Zerk isn't broken The Zerk made a lot of mistakes, but you made way more mistakes, and the biggest mistake was just never expanding, and, well, that one fight against the Lurker also wasn't it? So, my friend, Zerk isn't broken Zerk isn't too good at denying scouting They aren't too good at reproducing drones You just suck, and that's the hard reality I'm sorry All right That's going to be it for today's episode of Is It Inba or Do I Suck?

        "text": "Dear Harstam, in this game I was ahead since my opponent opened with an early pool, so I reacted correctly against that I also built a battery to be safe because he had an extractor I don't know why he didn't detect me For this reason I sent my units across the map and kill some drones In the scouting I saw no third base and a weird build order focused on upgrades What a weirdo, god In the midgame I had three bases and a high-tech army Zirk had no micro and was constantly rebuilding his entire army I had some favorable battles with huge disruptor connections But then he showed up with another 200-200 army on my side of the map. Maybe my mistake was the counter-attack before having more reinforcements or waiting for my upgrades I don't know what to do against that type of stuff Is it Imba or do I suck? Name Raul, race, protos, league diamond, surher, North America Indeed So we have Raul who struggled with an early pool Well, no, he didn't struggle with an early pool He had a good time against an early pool He was very far ahead, gone into a high-tech army, and then still somehow managed to lose the game against some weirdo that opened up with lots of upgrades So, yeah, let's just have a look what exactly happened here And now I'm inclined to agree with Raul already. I mean, his iotis form is very, very compelling I have to give it to him And I'm almost feeling like shipping I mean, this is an early pool This is a 14 pool This is one of the faster pools that there is You have a 12 pool before that, and then you have a 14 pool So it's the second, oh, this is not a build I am whatsoever aware of Okay, that's a quick extractor as well That's cool Raoul, like the safe player that he is and superior intelligence, scouts his opponent and wants to get some good reactions going I like that Opens up with a gate expand on the low ground And this is looking fantastic already for Raoul. I'm a big fan of Raoul already personally I also like the little thing that he has on the U I don't know what it's called I'm sure loads of you will make fun of me for not knowing what it's called But I like that The little dish, you know, it gives his name a little bit of character. Okay, so he scouts, sees that there's a single, a single larva turning into eggs okay sees the lack of a hatchery right right now if this was a regular 14 pool and your opponent is pumping out six eight or ten links this is a good response no this is not a good response you're not supposed to chrono your salad you're only supposed to get a single zealot However, if your opponent goes a 14 pool and builds two links, you actually have nothing to fear You can get a zealot if you want to, but in my opinion, you could just get a nexus out for all I care. This is a little bit like seeing a wasp flying around and calling the exterminator, you know? It's just you don't want to be that type of guy There's a wasp and they go like, like you mean a, a hive, a wasp hive? Is it a nest? And like, yeah, yeah, no, no, no I just saw one It's like, all right, buddy And they hang up because they think it's a prank call Like, you can't be discautious in life, my friend Like, you overreact This is like when your girlfriend's spirit is two hours late and you start construction of the baby room already Like, calm down, sit back, relax, you know? It's just two links It's not the end of the world All right. Like, we, we can, we can perhaps respond more strongly in the future if we have more information If he does indeed throw down a road corner, we'll 10 willings He got a battery, two adapts, three pylons It doesn't even make any sense 2832, 31 he could have been Now he's 2839 and gets the Nexus after that This is like installing airbus. bags on your shopping cart like nothing bad is going to happen to you my friend trust me all right like one salad would have been fine and you didn't even need the crono with you really did not need the krono it but you know i'm absolutely glad you did i'm i'm glad you did um the one thing that is nice is that if you ever oh speeding it up a bit too fast if you ever stay over you sleep at raoul's house he is for sure the guy that checks his uh monoxide detector batteries every single night you know just changes them into the new ones just making sure never living life on the edge just slightly cautious slightly cautious all right so let me open up that stupid form again what did he say i reacted correctly against that i liked that he just stated that like that was fact um i was ahead since my opponent opened with an early pool so i reacted correctly against that he would have gotten me if i didn't have a brain. He is very unlucky here that he sent it into me and that I do indeed have a brain Because this is obviously not the correct response You're down 10 workers Like, in what world are you ahead? The only thing you're ahead in is in idiocy, maybe And if the competition was to have the lowest possible IQ, you'd be a solid competitor as well Because this is not the response Battery, double gate, three adepts, nexus Your tech is insane. late like everything just sucks for you at this point like everything you scout with an adept you see an evo chamber okay you see a layer like even if you didn't watch the replay which I'm assuming at this point you haven't watched the replay back with this scout you should have been able to figure out that you're basically dead you're then you're down 10 workers he had an Evo already and he has a layer like major wood is completely busting you here oh a couple of pauses look at hate to see it okay three adepts you send your units across the map this is why you always need to drink five coffee before i owe this it's because otherwise you might miss the details look at this look at this not the first shot but now no no no no Look where he shoots. This guy She got hit in the face by two of his mates Decided to rather go for their mate than for another drone Did he hit him another time? No Okay So he loses three units, maybe four even, and kills five drones That's impressive That's not good It's not good Um, he's not going to One upgrades on the way as well He saw the fact that there was no How did he even see the fact there was no third base with this? He scouts with the void rate There could have been a third base, and my good friend Raoul would have been non-the-weiser This is He's been lying Just a lot Let me open this thing again So the first sentence is incorrect. In this game, I was ahead Since my opponent opened with an early pool, I reacted correctly That was a lie I don't know why he didn't attack me Well, I do know why he didn't attack you because there was up 10 workers For this reason, I sent my units across the map and kill some drones In the scouting, I saw no third base and a weird build order He saw the third base with the void ray We'll count it as part of sending the units across the map You know, you On the edge there, though, Raoul I won't push it too much further with your lies, you know? I wouldn't push it too much further Just be careful. A layer is still up, as always It's very rare that you see Zirk buildings demote in rank I haven't actually had it happen before, so I'm not quite sure why I mentioned that Gas is going down here for Raul Second battery, a good call Scouts with his void race, the fact that there was no units, there was no third base So early with his units that there was no units. And he thinks, you know what would really help me right now is a second battery in my natural, while I have complete map control and I don't have a third base yet this is the type of decision making that I'm personally I'm a very big fan of three void rays are out okay the follow up is going to be more adept a twilight council maybe a forge could be a possibility and Raul is pulling ahead at this point in the work account so that's nice the mechanics have been pretty solid could maybe be using this void to attack This is an interesting patrol move as well, isn't it? Just keeping an eye on this hatchery Well, we'll forgive him for that as well. Major wood currently on 1-1 upgrades Good upgrades Down in workers, though And a quick infestation pit, man Major wood really has a Once they get into the 3-3-A-sap, you can feel it, you know? I wouldn't mind a big round of drones He has some larva already as well So just a couple of notes Probably is just going to go into hydras and attack, though Oh, God, I love this Zirk player The builder doesn't make much sense, I have to admit, but I'm just a fan of people that do things, you know, and Major Wood definitely is doing things He's making moves, all right? He's making moves. At the same time, we have Raoul, who is, what is this? Three gateways, five gateway, so seven gate with charge No gas yet here I wouldn't mind if they gets staking can also need some way to get rid of that gas in the future Wouldn't mind the Templar archives He's seen Hydras So Templar, either for Storm or for Archons, is going to be a very good call Oh, here comes a move out, out of major wood And Raul, slightly too slow with that Voidre I don't mind that too much, though I mean, it happens, you know He got some information with it, and it is what it is Centries? Good Lord I'm not a fan of sentries personally too much against Zirk. Like, you need to do something with them, you know? Sentry is an investment into the near future, not into the long-term future Templars are always good There's not a moment in a PVZ where it go, dang, I wish I had less Templar No, it's always I wish I had faster Templar With sentries, they're good for sure It's very useful, but it does become less useful full over time Okay? And like the bigger the armies get, the more creep there is Once ultras are out or once lurkers are out or once ravagers are out or once ravagers are out or there's a lot of banlings Centries just lose a lot in value And also, I've seen Raul control his unit so far. I'm just afraid that the sentries just aren't going to contribute very much here to the fight So you have a guardian shield, a single force shield This army arrived completely after the zealots died a good move as well Personally, I'm a big fan of that It's where you send the support after the entire army has died There's not a lot of armies that do this, by the way, where they send their entire infantry and then after their infantry gets wiped out, they start sending in the medics to try and revive the dead bodies But I see that Raul has you write a book, The Art of War and how not to do it Not by Sun Tzu, but by Raul. And maybe he could have like the the prologue or like the first word by a major wood and he can for sure confirm that this guy knows nothing about warfare all right Raul leaves a couple of units behind that's fine scout units of course I wanted to check what the upgrades of his opponents are 2-2 he saw so Raul now knows to go back home he's like all right I don't want to engage into a 2-2 player while I'm getting only plus one myself so I do appreciate that we have road speed going on which 22 roaches I didn't even realize that 2 2 upgrades 3 3 on the way in an ultra cavern it is indeed quite weird all right you open up with 3 3 upgrades for range range plus 3 range upgrades and then you go into ultra the lurker than or vipers in my opinion would make slightly more sense but I'm not one to doubt major wood very quickly. So I'm not going to start doing that right here You have a couple of disruptors out I don't mind that It's probably a good call Now, Raul is he aware? Now, he's kind of unaware of his opponent's adventures into the hive territory He's not aware the fact that there's ultralisk either Raul is kind of unaware of most things happening on the map, though, to be fair So I feel like it's unfair to just stack everything on top of each other. there you know i could have just said his scouting sucks but instead i went on this massive list of things he isn't aware of it's like this is just kind of mean you know close to bullying i apologize for that raoul right we have a couple of cannons going down this guy hasn't moved out once either major wood a macro player doesn't attack mate just sits back waste till he gets attacked and then bang destroys you with his superior upgrades to disruptors extra is seven disruptors out already, nine disruptors Now, disruptors generally are very good against Roach Hydra Roaches and Hydras are not great at splitting They're easy to hit and they're pretty expensive. However, disruptors aren't great against ultras because ultras, they kind of get on top You need a lot of shots to kill one Ultra And because ultras are so fat, they basically cover your entire screen So it's difficult to hit multiple ultras at the same time Good start of the fight here, but now you need to run anyway I'm not even sure if this was like a good trait I don't know what this was before, but I feel like this was maybe a semi-even trade or slightly in favor of the Zerg Like, I mean, yeah, this wasn't actually a good fight The Zerg remains pretty much maxed out This was not a good fight for the Zerg, though. It's going to lose a couple of ultras Of course, not helping is the fact that these ultras don't have any attack upgrades either Still, at the end of the day, Zerk is 2K up or 2K downing units lost So Zerk has been trading better, mainly because of the upgrades, but also because the army composition of Raul just isn't very good I mean, now he's moving out immediately After scouting Ultralesk, like, after you see a tech switch so significant like this out of your opponent, you probably want to be switching yourself into something different and you don't want to stay on your stalker disruptor army No, you want to add more immortals and then wait for those to join your army. Then once you're maxed out, then once you have confirmed that your opponent is still going for the Ultras, maybe you can move out eventually This is going to most likely be another good fight If super battery, oh, it's not available currently, but otherwise this could have been a really good fight Still is a fine, fine engagement Down 2K Not the greatest I mean for how bad it started, it ends up okay. Now, if you're a toss player here and you hold this push and you saw a massive army over here as well i would say we max out go into storm make sure we get plus three going because we're down in upgrades we have a massive bank like 1200 minerals 900 gas like we can get a transition going we can get a fifth base i mean we're on 90 workers but instead we're moving out i'm not quite sure how or why or we g what excuse me double you TF I mean, you can't really be surprised anymore at this point that there's ultras and links Like, you've walked into ultras and links twice already. And now you walk into it again and you go, what the hell? What happened here, guys? It just doesn't make much sense to me Adrenal's not done yet for Major Wood, but Raoul seems not really be responding And also doesn't have the army ready Plus three is on the way finally Super battery can be cast No, can't be Yeah, actually, can be Yeah, we can use super battery here Could be useful One of the greatest spells in the game Yep, there we go Thank you very much It's actually going to be capable of maybe even holding this Problem is, he did lose a lot of workers here, and his opponent actually did get quite of a bank. Not necessarily because the opponent was mining more, but because the opponent is up like 7K in trade so far And if you're, oh my God, he rebuilds 39 hydras I love that move I love that move Good tech switches here of the Zerk I do like that move a lot So if you take a look at the current army value, I'll just pass the game here for a second Okay, just let's get this straight So we have an army value of about 3K here for Raul And he is down in the units lost by about 7K That means he lost this army two times, two and a half, 2 2, 2 3 times, something like that. extra if he would have this army two and a half more times he'd be at 150 supply probably make a pretty have a decent chance here at winning the game I'd say at this point I mean he's going to walk into into a person who just has been saving money because Majorwood hasn't been losing a lot of units forgets the Gigi as well leaves the game Raoul very odd Raoul very very odd alright let's get some thoughts together here okay so first of all let's go over let's just discuss your early game let's discuss your early game I'm going to judge you on your early game your army composition and your micro so that's three things number one your early game you mentioned that you reacted correctly to the early pool that was incorrect you did not react correctly correctly, you reacted the worst way possible, you completely overreacted, delayed your nexus by almost a minute and a half for no real reason, and you were just down 10, 12 workers. Like, your early game was actually probably by far the worst part of this game Well, not by far Your micro, well, we'll get to that soon Yeah, it wasn't by far, but it definitely was the worst part of the game Your early game was awful Honestly, just terrible really terrible So for that, you're going to get the suck Number two, let's do the micro So we saw your first pushout First, we saw your first pushout with the adepts and the zealots in which you targeted your own adept, somehow managed to kill five workers, but lost four units Your second attack, you walk in with all your zealots first, before your sentries arrive, lose all of them, then have to move back home. And then the next attack, the disruptor fight was good control the disruptor boss relatively well Like you split them separately, even though you fight them very quickly, and you control them That was not bad So, yeah, for that, I mean, two awful fights and then one okay fight Still pretty awful, so you get the pretty awful stamp Not great, not terrible, and more leaning to the terrible side, honestly Final one, unit composition This is really where it kind of fell apart for you in the last. later stages of the game because you did come back economically even though your early game was terrible and your micro in the first few fights was awful you just didn't have the unit comp to deal with your opponent's unit comp you're every single fight you're just a step behind you attacked into someone with mess hydras with pure zealette well you had sentries but you didn't use them then afterwards you finally had your disruptor so you had something to deal with the roach hydra your opponent had ultras already you had nothing for that and then in the end you finally had some immortals and this guy switched back to Hydras You never really were ready for his units You just kind of got outbrained. So for that, you're going to get a pretty massive incompetent stamp Put all three of these stamps together And you, my friend, do suck, as this was absolutely not imbalanced All right I think that's going to be it for today's episode of Is It Inba or Do I Suck? If you liked it, don't forget to let me know as well by hitting the tombs up in the thing and subscribe and comment down below what you thought of Raoul's performance in this game and of course how much you guys liked Major Wood shout out to your Major and yeah that's it chow-cha yeah that's it Chow-cha!."

        "text": "Dear Harsham, it is me, your loyal fan Diabolus After my last IOTIS roasting at your hands, I have re-emerged from the murky depths of any platinum with another balance complaint While my MMR has not improved, my macro and fundamentals have, it is for this reason that I submit another Iyotis complaint against Zirk, because I am so much better now that the only reason why I lost this game is because of imbalance Zirk is completely broken, despite having a nine, 90 supply lead at the 12-minute mark, Bainlings eviscerated my army Zirk's ability to quickly remax and spread creep meant I had no chance to respond I attacked effectively, destroying three Zirk bases, and having an advantage in bases over my opponent throughout the match. Despite this, Zirk waltzed over my army, as if I was playing against Seral, so harsdom Is it Inba? Or do I still suck? Now, first thing to notice here, is that this guy is abusing the caps lock like it's a YouTube title and I do not approve of that my friend let's uh let's keep the capital letters for the start of the sentence and and that's gonna be it let's keep the capital letters for the start of the sentence but once again i'll have a look at one of your games here diabolus as you're complaining about zirk let's see what happens this time around i'm gonna be real with you i can't remember your game from last time at all Bera, bera, bidip. Turbo Dap That's awful A lot of good decisions being made here with Diabolus Not My man Diabolus is going to be the most jealous boyfriend in the world as well You have to start from zero You have nothing You need to create these things out of thin air That's going to be a difficult and long process and I don't really want to help you with it and that usually when it comes to IOTUS is a positive thing. It probably meant that you weren't one of the top five idiots because I tend to keep a list of top five idiots in my head that if anyone ever anyone ever shows up in real life and says, hey, I am this guy, I know a top five idiot and you can just keep walking, don't have to shake the hand, you know? This is the types of you don't want to touch these people because that is dangerous They might try to steal some of your IQ or accidentally you catch what they have which is a low IQ So you didn't make the list and that tends to be a positive thing We're going to see what you'll do here in the early game. As your opponent, Life of Adam, that is the less popular version of Life of Brian It's actually made before Life of Brian Not a lot of people know that Not quite as successful though Start with a drone scout You start with an SEV scout as well So you're going to be able to get some type of information and you'll immediately see the lack of a quick hatchery So this is not a hatch first You should be aware of this After you scout this, oh, you are aware of this He's like, hey, wait, this hatch isn't done yet Let me double check and leave again All right I'm completely down with that You know, if you weren't sure, that's completely fine. You're going to get a second factory Beautiful lineup here, by the way Look at that So I just want to note what happened here is this SUV in the depot was about the finish And rather than using this SUV to build a factory, they built a factory here, you decided to send an SCV from your main to walk over here so that this SCV could go straight back to mining Now, this is the type of inefficiency that Germans have nightmares about, you know, or the Swiss I think the Swiss might be more efficient Now, Swiss are precise, Germans are efficient And then he walks back Okay, this was insane. This SUV, finished the depot rather than building the factory, walked to the minerals, and then from the minerals, rather than mining anything, straight went and built a bunker Beautiful Absolutely love that That's so great Rather than using the Reaper to go across the map, you use it to kill the extractor Now, people could say, ah, what a stupid move But actually, that's not a stupid move at all, because your opponent is playing a pool first, and thus it's very possible that is hiding links on the map Going across the map with the Reaper would actually have been potentially a pretty big mistake Something that I would recommend is scouting with your Reaper after building two marines. The bunker is a good call, but you go two marines before the reactor, and then you can go tech lab on the factory In case you see roaches, you go for a cyclone If you don't see roaches, you just swap the barracks with the factory, you go helions, and you can just put the barracks on that tech lab and you can start stim or something, get your star port up Rather than any of these things, you had no units in the bunker that you just, oh my God How did that even happen? Okay, well, you're still going to lose the bunker You have no helions on the way whatsoever You didn't start a unit from this either because your gas was too late. You're floating 600 minerals Well, your star port is finished Now, your early game build order here, I'm going to have to be real It's a bit of an embarrassment And it's not just an embarrassment for you It's an embarrassment for NA And it is difficult to embarrass North America when it comes to bad. builders because they've seen some bad builders all right that is all that happens on the american server but you my friend you pushed it again double barracks and third cc going down at the same time an absolute classic of someone floating 800 minerals at the four minute mark just love to see that base is lifted now you could be thinking kevin you're being a little bit negative is it really that bad yes this is this is really bad um it just yeah it was awful you have a tank now which is practically useless because you're not facing roaches You could have known that you weren't facing roaches by sending in your Reaper earlier after the second Marine, which you didn't do. And now you're going to lose all your Marines on the low ground one more time You're going to lose this mule most likely as well Yep Another SCV goes down as two So this is just been terrible so far Okay, this has been, we could classify this as a bad start The only good thing here is that probably because you weren't microing your Reaper with 900 APM, like sometimes you see platinum players do, rather what you did here is you actually build some things I'm just a fan of people that do things, you know? Even though they're late, even though they're slow, you do have a third CC and you're actually macroing And this can actually be an advantage I have a theory. This is a theory that is not based on much data yet, but I have a theory that when Terence in lower levels get attacked and they're forced to stay at home that they have a higher chance of winning, even if they're behind after the attack, purely because they have no units to micro, because the average Terran player, like they think they're clam or Maru, but in reality they're still just platinum So what happens is they'll spend the entire time focusing on their Reaper and two aliens, making sure that they can deal 25 damage to a queen while taking as little damage as possible. in the meanwhile floating 1,700 minerals at the 5 minute mark, forgetting their e-base, even forgetting their second and their third racks, their third CC, no SUV production But this guy, look, Diabolus hasn't been focusing on anything aggressive, and he's just been building SUVs He has e-base ready Sure, the timing isn't correct He doesn't have any gas to start any upgrades He accidentally opened up with two tech labs to go Stim and Combat Shield at the same time and thus completely limit his own marine production But all of these things are details Okay Oh no The first liberator is out But the Ebola just shift clicked it in and isn't actually paying attention to it This is beautiful. This is the type of terrain I love to see, you know? The terran that says, I know that I'm not good and I'm not going to pretend that I'm good I shift clicking in the liberator and what happens happens Oh no Oh my God He looked at it He thought he could micro it See, there's no use, my friend Just keep it there and don't pay attention to it no more It will do You know, Terran sometimes just kind of plays itself You got to trust that You know, you got to trust the race in this case Trust the Terran Now, we have Life of Adam, actually a little bit behind after that. Not quite sure how, but he's not in a great spot, honestly. Even though as we speak, we're getting two Marauders produced from two Barracks. Now, that's obviously not the way you want to play. You always want to have as many Marines as you can, even from the Tech Lab, that you usually have to get stim and afterwards combat shield. Don't produce Marauders unless you're playing against Roaches. Marauders don't really do a lot against Ling Bane. They're good against tanking versus Banelings, but honestly the damage output of the Marine is so important that you just want to get as many Marines as you can, as long as there's no Roaches, of course. Spire's going up. Another reason why Marauders not as great at the start Hmm Because they don't shoot up, obviously It's really just as simple as that they yeah they just don't shoot up so just got to kind of keep that in mind all right two meta facts are now coming out of this changeling is hiding well look at that changeling looks a lot bigger though than the others now it does look slightly bigger is it always looking bigger or am i just going wild in the head might just be the angle that it's at oh over here in the main base he's basically everything here for a life of adam first six Muralisks are on the way as well. We're going to be looking at what the possibilities are for Diabolus here He said around 12 minute mark He was up, I think he said 70 supply or 90 supply Now he said 90 supply Was up 90 supply We'll see if that's actually going to be the case Or if he lied You know, sometimes people lie to me and that's completely okay Except I do need to know that, you know, so I know what kind of person we're dealing with. officer flies through the turret all good let's take a look at this control over here if there's going to be any control of course all of it getting spotted here by the changeling banning run by is not quite going to succeed i always like to pass my army on the edge of creep as well just to make sure that my opponent can really get that boost on the banlings until they truly reach my army this should be a really bad fight for the terran it is a really bad fight for the terran you just kind of forgot the micro there they just didn't do you just walked over and took it not ideal okay you do need to use stim and probably split a little bit siege your tanks all of these things tend to be very useful it feels like diabolus is pretty much just almost dead at this point honestly it's just very far ahead in eco for whatever reason we see live at them add a couple of extra drones right now This Muralisks will try to take out the refinery. We'll attack this turret as well And I mean, a repair should be possible There we go Repair will be able to take out this Muralisk Individual Muta Lisk micro This is something we don't see every single day, especially not when it comes to the lower leaks A little bit of oversaturation is all I wonder what's going on here So we have a couple of supply depot drops Look at oversaturations You just keeps building workers as well That is way too many. workers for the amount of mineral patches that there are my friend it's like the gold rush holy crap there's only so many spots we can mine from guys not everything here is made of gold 31 SVs out of 16 that is truly oversaturation more workers less income absolutely good grief threat by the way to be fair we haven't seen a single scan yet out of Diabolus he's been using all of that energy on mules and he's been using his army to basically function as bait for bainlings Not quite sure what the bait is there It's like, hey, explode on these marines They're very tasty He's like, well, that's kind of what the Zerk wants as well. So I'm not sure if that's the optimal play here Life of Adam's floating a little bit of money I'm going to say a little bit He's floating about 2 5K right now, and also 800 gas So you could say, man, my opponent is so much worse than me He's floating so much while I'm also floating a lot, but a little less But then it's like, well, if your opponent manages to survive while floating 4K resources, really it is you who sucks Like, it should not be possible for your opponent to be down 50 supply at the 11 minute mark and there to be no consequences because you're just not attacking Because let's face it here, Diabolus did one attack over here. He got completely destroyed And ever since then, we haven't seen a drop these tanks aren't sieged either so it feels like he should be moving out any second at this point actually have no clue what he's doing at this point it's just adding more turrets always like to check first person he's an orbital on the fort as well this is the type of move that switzerland would pull as another war is about to ensue it's like hello we're in a war zone here in switzerland and it's like no no we're staying neutral i'm not quite sure what a swiss accent is It's like a semi-German accent No, no, we stay in neutral That's a Swiss accent I know it I know you, Swiss. All they care about is money See, he's mining Making sure they get the optimal resources while the rest of the world fights You don't give a crap, but really get a planetary at your fourth basis, guys It's way better Tank siege? Good start This is the 12 minutes This is the 12 minutes He's not quite almost up 90 supply It's 80 supply Oh, well, 70-ish 74 supply, it's almost 90 supply, the 12 minute mark That is pretty good It's going to be taking out a couple of these drones Scanned creep as well So he's taking out a bunch of the creep Didn't really take out the first part of the creep, though, just the middle part. I know you guys have heard of the cutting off the head of the snake, but Diabolas here is inventing a new one That's cutting out the middle segment of the snake, because that's really the body of the snake You know, what is a snake without its body, you could ask? And that's the type of question that we need to ask here It's going to be taking out this basis Honestly, this game feels really over 35 bailings on the way It's hard for me to believe that all of these banlings will connect, especially as there's four tanks And we could just clear some creep, send the next reinforcements, see these tanks a little bit more forward. I would recommend using the tanks that right now is your only form of splash damage in this army And then, I mean, you can just have a really nice position. you're he never really was up 90 supply but yeah 80 supply then you know we'll walk out he'd say 90 right if it's 70 I'm actually gonna lose it the yeah 90 supply lead at the 12 minute mark that is yeah that is well count that okay walks back over creep towards the right side I love this so much it was like okay I just spent the past four minutes clearing every single creep tumor on the left side taking out this base, basically getting to the head of the snake, but then he remembered all of a sudden that he was going for the middle of the snake, so once again he wants to start clearing creep on the right side while keeping the beginning and the head intact. This is absolutely brilliant This is high-level Starcraft If Clem is watching this, take note, Young One, because this is the type of stuff we need to see at the high level This rotation was fantastic as well, by the way I think we might actually have a fight here I'll get to that rotation in a bit Tanks could have been sieged They're going to siege as everything runs in They get one shot off Clumps every single unit on top of each other as much as possible This is very impressive So, so far we've seen two fights, and Diabolus is starting to convince me that he might not actually have hands He might be playing this game with his feet. The level of micro that we are seeing here is so insanely low, that I really would be surprised if you could actually perform a trick like this These banlings also were completely unexpected I think he saw the entire path from the banlings here to the command center over here That's like a 35 second warning that he had He's like one of the slow friends If you ever do the thing where you throw an object at Diabolus and you say catch quickly, he won't even realize that something hit him until like 30 seconds later and you can always blame it on someone else It's like the ideal franta prank, the ideal franta prank. That rotation, by the way, that we saw, I want to come back to that So he went from here, walked back over the creep, not even through this middle area, because the creep here is more dangerous It's the middle segment of the creep Let's not forget about that Walked back to the head of the creep, over here, on top of this, then go here, clear the creep tumors in the middle, not the active tumor, the tumor in the middle, to walk into a base without being sieged This entire rotation was so insanely slow, it just gave the Zerk so much time to prepare I'm not even quite sure what the goal was either It's like you really like killing the edge bases. Rather than just sending a double drop here and keeping this position, you decide to run your entire army around the map for a minute and a half You're the type of guy in the gym that between his sets just browses to fitness reddit for 35 minutes By the time you start your second set, your body doesn't even realize anymore that you did something in the first place So it's completely pointless It's like people always say rest well in between sets Like you might as all take a nap in between it made Like, you're freaking resting in between rotations I've never seen something like this The point of rotations is that they're quick and that they confuse your opponent. You might have all had like a massive sign on your head saying I'm going to attack the middle creep segment on the right side right now You just don't control your units either Like you're just standing still I don't actually understand how this is possible Like what were you even looking at here? What was more important at this point? Oh my god, you have 9K resources I got so upset at everything you've done so far that I completely missed the fact that you haven't built a single unit in the past five minutes Okay, what are you looking at? What is this? Are you building a star part? Looking at the barracks? Your entire army gets blasted You're standing on the edge of creep. This is brilliant You don't even realize until your army is completely dead This is absolutely fantastic Your opponent is moving Is this the game? What even was your complaint? I don't understand this at all I think you complained about your opponent being able to remax and spread creep Your opponent spread creep all right, but mainly because you didn't take out any of the creep tumors But remixing, your opponent hasn't been maxed once Your opponent hasn't even gotten above 130 supply yet, I believe Maybe 140 once You just You just ignore your units It's like a first date gone wrong and you just ghost them It's like, oh, I don't actually want to talk with you guys no more. That's not the way, my friend Free Max, he said I can't believe you complain about it This guy's 1 23 supply You're just not controlling What are you doing? How is this more vital at this moment? As 12 Ultralesk If your country, wherever you live, well, America probably, judging by this game and the server you play in, If America ever gets attacked, the guys are knocking on your door with the guns You hear grenades explode You're the type of guy that checks on his tomato plant to make sure you'll have tomatoes next summer It's like, hello? We have a slightly more important business going on right now, buddy Grab your firearm, start shooting Okay, once again, we do get some units out. Up in supply, one more time We've been consistently up in supply opponent hasn't remixed once because in order to remix, you first need to initially max, otherwise it's just a max out Life of Adam hasn't maxed out yet, and thus a remix is literally impossible You just lie to me This is not a remix And it's such an obvious lie as well You could have just seen this This is like telling your wife you're going to the strip club because they make a mean tuna sandwich Like, it's just not true I know it, you know it Your wife knows it, who now left you for a more successful person that can micro is units This is just painful to watch. Infinite energy as well in your command centers What even is this? 5 3-t-t-tete-t-t-t You're like 12 mules Okay, I can't No, actually, 12 mules, maybe Very possible You might have actually 12 mules Okay, here we go again Seach the Liberators? How? Okay, we get a stim Liberators are fighting No control back This is actually bonkers to watch You're just not doing anything Okay, I'm gonna watch this fight again I just wanna see what you see I wanna look at the world through your eyes Are you actually from Switzerland and you just wanna remain neutral? I know that Switzerland is like the mandatory military service as well So they train all these soldiers that they don't really use and feel similar to you. Like you have a lot of money? They have a bunch of soldiers but you don't really want to use them Like you're looking at the fight, okay, now you start seething You just don't look at your army ever And you probably have the mini map turned off or something like that I wonder if that's an option that I'm just not aware of Probably to put in a lot of work to get that going Three tanks are still siege in the back It's like, oh wait, tanks don't actually shoot up If you keep attacking with this army, I'm going to be extremely upset Please send it back home Or just leave it here I don't care either Another first date ghosted. Back to the new army I like this army more now Oh my God Good Lord, you're awful Oh, here we go F2 did it? Nice That's beautiful That's beautiful Uh-oh The moment I see something appear on the mini map, I just get extremely afraid because I know what you have shown before Okay, tank siege up Your army is huge Your army is way bigger than your opponents You actually feels like you're kind of in the lead here Honestly It feels like you should almost be capable of just straight up winning this game Your opponent is at 171 supply, so really close to maxing out for the first time I'm going to be able to take out this base. Do these broodlers have any upgrades? Plus one on air and the broodlings will have some upgrades, which is nice Okay, you scan You see What was this scan, actually? You just move there and you see there's no creep Rather than scanning up the ramp Now you see the brute lords Okay, huh I have about 35 marauders in this army 25 Marines I bet this is going to be great A great idea This is a brilliant blink I love that Brilliant teleport I don't think your units are stinted anymore at this point Not targeting down anything, really Just fighting the broodlings The broodlings and the hatchery have priority here, by the way This is great. Now the Ultras come in? These Brutlords are actually going to win the game, aren't they? Battlecrues are the answer No Vikings No ghost No Thor's He's almost plus three on the armory Continues building tanks It's like, huh I feel like that tanks have really been proven to be worthy so far I'm sure I haven't sieged them up yet at all this game My opponent right now is eight Brutlords, but I feel like more tanks is really what we need There's no Thor production whatsoever Two, three Thor's would absolutely destroy this Four Thor's then Four Thor's would absolutely destroy this air There's no ground army, except for a couple of Ultras, but no links to really annoy your units. So Thor's would be super good They wouldn't be getting bugged out too much Okay, you don't stim, no meta-fax? Like, you just don't use your units And I don't understand it It's really like your you're just playing without hands It's like, are you playing with your feet, Diabolus? If you send me an email saying that you play with your feet, I will put up a rectification next time around I'll be like, I'm sorry I'm sorry for making fun of you, my friend I didn't know that you were one of the first feet players, you know, and that you just like to juggle at the same time as playing But you haven't controlled your units once in a single fight. You haven't made any good decisions. Hey, you're an actual donkey. And although I do look a little bit like Shrek, if you and I would be starring in a movie together, I'm afraid you wouldn't make it out of the swamp because you'd probably drown. Like, no, I can swim with my feet. It's like, mate. This is not it. Your opponent might actually hit max though for the first time in this entire game by the time it ends by the time it ends. You're actually behind in supply for the first time in a big way. You still have a terrible army. You continue building Battlecruisers rather than Vikings or Ghosts or Thors. This is a good fight if you stim. If you stim and control, this could really be a good fight This was not a bad fight, honestly You killed, what, three, four ultras? This is probably more that you killed with 200 supply armies against like 90 supply earlier. like it really is as easy as just stimming and controlling your units a little bit but you decided not to do that i i respect life of adam by the way creed rat marvelous um unit control of life of adam yeah has been pretty good unit compositions have been pretty okay as well life of adam guy has some real potential here it's not the quickest when it comes to spending money not the greatest early game but i yeah i definitely suggest playing more like life of adam than playing like diabotia But then again, I really would not suggest playing like Diabolus whatsoever, ever, in a million years. You think Diabolus is just dead, no? I like that he stays in as well, till 26 supply Mate, you didn't manage to win with 200 supply against 90 What makes you believe that now you can win with two Marines and one marauder? Usually as well, when Terence stay in with very low supply, they start microwing their units, like a creptle, you know, I have like five Marines against 35 zealads and they're stutter stepping and they're picking up individual Marines, except Diabolus doesn't know how to do that, so he's just standing there and still looking at his unit Like with nothing else to do, he still didn't manage to stim his Marines immediately This is just extremely impressive. Ah, we're not going to, we're not ever going to hit Max Quick Gigi out of life He had it ready for like the past five minutes He was just sitting like this, you know, getting ready in the moment his opponent type Gigi, you go, pop, Gigi, got it in All right, Diabolus. Let's have one more look at your imbalance complaint for you said your micro your macro and your fundamentals have improved now if your micro has actually improved from last time then i'm going to have to go back and look at your micro from last time because this was honest to god some of the absolute worst micro that i've seen in my entire life i've watched gold replays i've watched silver replays i've watched bronze replays all players worse than you but this is just you just didn't control anything didn't stim majority of the fights almost never caged up or never caged up in time and some fights you didn't even siege up during the fight you complain about zirks ability to quickly remax and spread creep it doesn't matter because even the fights of creep you still lost because you didn't control creep only matters for speed but the speed of the zirk army doesn't matter if you're not controlling your units So the two things you complain about, the remax and the creepspread are completely irrelevant. Remax didn't happen, and creeps threat doesn't matter because you're not moving anyway You attacked effectively? What do you mean effectively? You rotated a five-minute rotation where you could have just killed your opponent by seizing forward How is that effective? Destroying three Zerk hatcheries Just because you destroy three Zerk hatcheries, that's not very good Imagine I'm in a boxing competition, okay? and I knock out my first three opponents You might think, wow, that's pretty good Then I get knocked out in my fourth match And then I say, well, I had a good performance at my boxing tournament because I knocked out three opponents. But then later, if you learn that I was fighting against three-year-olds, all of a sudden you think, wait, how did you get knocked out in your fourth match? And that's what I'm wondering Why did you only kill three? You're freaking a 90 supply lead, a better army Your opponent had like 30 bailings and 6 mutilisk against an actual Max Terran army, why wasn't only three hatcheries? Why didn't you eat his hive as well? Like, you should have eaten this guy alive with what you had, and you didn't You played freaking terrible, this Zerk waltzed over your army as if you were playing against Cyril No, this Zerk waltzed over your army as if you were micro and with your feet. So, harsdom, is it Inba or do I still suck? Diabolus, you've gotten worse This is not imbalanced, you suck, and you suck real hard All right That's going to be it for today's episode of Is It Inba or Do I Suck?

        "text": "Dear Harstam, I am writing to you today that Terran is so imba I admit that I am just a low-level platinum two player, but even at my skill, Terran shouldn't have won this game Throughout the game, I had good storms and good army compositions The beginning of the game was bad, I admit, but I got ahead eventually The reason it should be imba is that I had a really good army composition, it's the second time he brags about his army composition, at the last fight, but just because I didn't storm him, I lost the game in an instant Even my mid-game engagement, in which I recalled, should have ended him but didn't. Is it imba? Or do I just suck as a platinum level player? He throws in a lot that he's a platinum player I'm not sure if it's like a brag what a lot of the Americans do when they went to like an Ivy League school He's like, actually I went to Princeton It's Ivy League It feels like he's doing this But, well, you know, we'll give him the benefit of the doubt for now By the way, nice new imbalance complaint from him We finally updated the 22 20 regulations to 2021 And we're only 11 months into 2021 So that promises a lot for next year Platinum, Protos, North America, it's the Holy Trinity of Idiocy So let's just pop straight into it. As we have Assisto here, the top left, who starts with a Kronoboose Well, this is not promising a whole lot And we have Judut here in the I wonder if this guy starts every single game with this Judith used the rock throw That is dedication to the part, I have to admit, it is dedication to the part I like that You know what? We're going to see if Assisto is going to be capable of catching this opponent of guard Catching, Pokemon, nice Or this builder is god awful to start with, all right? You chronobo boost your first workers just to get supply block so that the chronoboose didn't even matter Gateway at 16, gas at 16. It's going to be one of them games, huh? All right Well, let's not try to look too closely to the Billsoram We're still going to, you know, have a quick, a quick look at it, but we don't want to focus too hard on it It's all I'm going to say We're not going to focus too hard on it Second Kronabood Good Lord I've had a rough day already, okay? I went outside for a walk and it was raining and I don't like the rain It gets me wet and my hair becomes all fluffy afterwards So now I have to deal with that. And now I'm dealing with a platinum two protels who chronobo boosted before his first pylon, gets two gases before the cybercore and still somehow has a cybercore that goes down at 1 30 six seconds later than it should be Well, okay, platinum two I'll keep it in mind Platinum two, I'll keep it in mind Taryn, meanwhile, my man Judeut He's not only been studying the art of po- No, what is this? It's not only been studying the art of Pokemon, but also the art of build orders This is an actual build order Even puts the first barracks in the correct position, and it makes me extremely happy Why would you do this? I don't even understand what this Is this the block? the. is it This was to block the thing, the add-on He goes factory before ad-on anyway Does the game look very slow to me? Yeah, it did look very slow to me Meanwhile, he got supply block at home, but How is this stalker not out yet? This cybercore finished 30 seconds ago, but he was supply block the entire way through is floating 400 minerals, gets a battery This battery might finish before his first unit does Oh my God He catches the Reaper in the probes around Okay, I need to readjust my expectations for this game right now I need to move down a couple of levels I started here at the Platinum 2 level. Right now, I'm off camera already, okay? And I think I'm going to eventually, I'm just going to have to move my camera down bit by bit so I can show you guys how far down we are You'll actually maybe even get to see the floor by the end of this recording Looks fine Okay Taryn continues going with something that resembles a build order It's not the tightest It's not the greatest, but he's building the buildings semi-correctly He's loading a fair amount of money He's getting a third depot when he shouldn't, but the third pylons going down already After getting supply block for the first time, he got so shocked by that that he decided he'll never be supply block ever again. Because Twilight into Robo, double eBay out of the TaremD4 Barracks Now we're seeing some build orders Warpgate will finish This is just to show how bad the unit production has been Is that I think he crono boosted two of the Warpgate units and still the Warpgate finishes at the same time as the third Gateway unit finishes It means, yeah, well it was just a 30 second delay on the first unit It actually makes complete sense It actually does make complete sense It's going to go for four gate blink Now, for a point of reference, when I would play forgate blink, I can hit on the other side of the map at 505 with blink done and 11 stalkers, a prison, and an observer. 505, okay? I'm very curious to see what this Protos has in store for us when it comes to a timing He's on 29 workers I think I also have 38 workers, by the way, like 39, something like that Yeah, 39 workers Let's see what a good friend Assistol has going for him It's a battery going for him It starts with an immortal rather than a prison It's a classic fourgate blink here, where you can't warp on the other side of the map, but you do have an immortal You can tank a couple of tank shots One more battery After not scouting for a long time, he decided that two batteries is now the way to move forward. I don't quite see it, but once again, we'll let him play for a bit Gets more stalkers So this is the point where I'd be on the other side of the map with 12 stalkers and a prism, 39 workers Well, I'd be there for the past 10 seconds already Right now, a systol has seven stalkers and an immortal and six less workers Also, no prism And he's not killing his opponent yet I'm so curious what the plan is I also like that he praised himself multiple times on the unit compositions And so for all he's doing is building stalkers and one immortal There's no sentry to complement this army There's no adapt for scouting. He now goes into a dark shrine to get DTs, which is, this is an army that doesn't trade well straight up with pure bio Okay? It's just, that's a fact Unless you're near a battery or you're with a choking and you have a bunch of sentries, this is not a great army comp Adding in another thing that won't help with either AOE or boosting the strength of your army and straight-up engagement like charge wood or like stormwood actually is bad army It's actually a bad army composition and it doesn't help you whatsoever Now we see charge coming down A couple of zealots are being produced But charts can be done at this point already Charges started really late for no real reason. You have a third base on the way, which is also very late but I'm honestly not even going to mention the time anymore because at this point I do not believe that a systol has a timer because if he has a timer and he knows how to benchmark anything he would know that this build order is complete garbage and no matter how brilliant his unit compositioning is he you know he could just have so much more crap than this that it doesn't and even his unit composition is good There's no sentry for Guardian Shield I just don't like this army Just not a fan of it Just not a fan of it No sentries whatsoever. When you have a majority range army, it's just bad What is this flank? I just have no clue what this flank is Okay, now this comes in Okay, this gets scanned He could have killed this army like five years ago Now he's gonna go He's gonna get it good though Good start Blinks forward with four stalkers Then fights in the choke Realize his charge finishes up I don't even How did he lose that fight? I feel like if he would have moved commander across the map, he would have gotten a better fight He killed like a tank and lost five stalkers there He lost more resources so far That was a hundred percent win that fight. He had much, much more than his bonus His opponent didn't even have combat shield yet I think he was matching Stalger count with his opponent's marine count This is absolutely phenomenal play so far here Goes for What's it called? Shadow Stride? So Shadow Stride on the Dark Templar before getting any form of splash Ah, this is If you ever need a guy that does the unit compositions for you, hire a systal because he has something that all the other guys that make unit compositions for you don't have That is the lack of a brain Because holy crap, how can he be eight minutes into the game without building a single sentry? Look at this. What has he lost so far? An observer for Zellas He literally's just been building Zellet Immortal Stalker Brilliant unit composition That's what he said, no? I'm going to check again I hate this when this happens I had a really good army The reason it should be Inba is that I had a really good army composition I had good storms and good army compositions How dare he say that? This is like a Terran bragging about that he managed to throw out some Marines and marauders, a couple of Mavecs Like the Terran unit composition is very easy because you just get any unit that starts with an M and you're probably going to be fine. I guess in that way the Protels does have a more difficult job You have a zealot starting with a Z, the Stalker with the F and the Immortal with an I That's already three different letters in this army I wonder if Assisol knows how the alphabet works Did he also do the alphabet song as a kid, like all of us? I'm not sure I'm not sure if he did Oh, scout out of Judeoot? She's the gas? Where's he going to go? Then starts patrolling this I love that I love that It's just scouting for a forays, the entire game through Neither player is actually doing anything either right away, except assistal is creating the great wall Here is one, two. All of this is just touching vision I kind of like it, but it also looks very odd Just an entire wall with pylums here His army composition still nine minutes in, no splash Also, no upgrades, by the way His opponent is on 2-2 His 1-1 halfway done And he didn't really take any probe damage, right? He lost three workers, but I think that was all to the Reaper He just hasn't been building workers, hasn't been building nexite quick enough, like he's still on three bases And he has a garbage armours He also hasn't been harassing I'm going to go first person here I want to see what this man does Is this piling going to get sniped before the DTs finish? No shot. No shot No shot No, this guy's just going to scout Okay, look at this Okay, so he's controlling these DTs Okay, maybe controlling was a big word for what he did to those DTs I want to watch that again I just want to note that he was doing nothing for the past He I didn't even realize this, but he, after he warped in, he just waited for them to finish Okay, so you're gonna warp in At 16 day warp in, this is a slow warp in He just sits here and wait 16 APM 0 He's just watching it. Then as he sends them in, he decides this is the time to focus a little bit more on this pylon rather than moving my camera screen to the right. Look at this. Rather than seeing the fact that there's a turret here, now look, let's go back to his vision, he's still paying attention to the matter of fact. He loses both of the DTs, watches in disbelief as both of his DTs go down. He just sits there going like, oh no I think he's watching this like it's a sports match, you know? Like the sports fans go, no, I can't believe my DTs. So then there's a little bit of a delay He accidentally hits his mouse with the elbow as he's starting this. And now takes a look at the rocks Like, oh, there's rocks there This area is still dark I can't see anything here Let me move my entire army here Oh, he's looking for the Madovac Oh, he's killing the S And the Madov He found it It is a game-winning move Very nice Very, very nice Floating 2,500 resources during all of this, by the way That's just fantastic 2,500 resources For a full minute, he just paid attention to this pylon and then to this dark spot to catch a Madovac Just didn't macro That is prioritization, my friends That is something we don't see every day. Meanwhile the terran casually a hundred minerals okay a hundred minerals float That's a pretty big flex that's a pretty big flex To still about equal in supply for whatever reason though managed to actually spend some of his money army composition Let's just do a quick yeah new segment this is the army composition check Welcome to the army composition check Zellet stalker immortal Templar so After having zealot immortal stalker for the first eight minutes, I think he got a stalker and immortal at like the five minute mark Then he started adding zealots at six Took him five minutes to get Templar out So now we have Templar That's great Thanks for watching this army composition check. This was sponsored to you by VIP Grenad's not No free sponsorship for you guys If you want to sponsor the next army composition check be sure to send me an email for it's going down for for it's going down for uh jood as our rock thrower hasn't really done much i thought judoots would be a little bit like this is great sensor tower positioning right away i love that he's like really focused it's like this guy just love van diagrams you know he just loves them in paint So what he does is he takes a screenshot of Starcraft in game after he builds sensor towers Then he photoshops out all of the units on the mini map and he has a van diagram. That's actually what he does Then he post it as a meme on Reddit A true story It's all true story I love this movement as well This is pretty smart because he has vision everywhere else and then he thinks rather than building another 100 mineral structure, I can just move my entire army here So if anything comes over here, my entire army will be here to welcome him It of course has one small downside and it is if the opponent decides to move over here, your army is completely out of position and by the time you get home, you will have lost two of your bases and probably all of your production. But I mean, if you consider that small downside with a huge upside, that if anything ever comes here, which is very unlikely because this is the least popular area of the map, he's gonna destroy it with his great army composition Oh my god, it's time for the army composition check So he has a d t, arcon, one immortal, seven Templar, actually five DTs And zealids, still no sentry, by the way A cybernetic core tech unit, which provides two armor upgrades to your entire army, or at least everything that stands within the guardian shield range Oh my god, I can't believe this is happening I was on the other side of the map without scouting and now my opponent is on my side. Oh, she's going to attack into this This is brilliant Okay, so this is half the army of the Terran See how this fight will go EMP's actually hitting Okay, storms his own zealots I just want to plant the flag here so everyone can see it He said great storms He just had a fight in which there were four ghosts and four zealots and he stormed both of them evenly So far the storms have not had a net benefit for anyone in this game He just managed to lose a fight against half of the army of his opponent I didn't know that was possible Okay These were good storms Well, they were storms and the other guy had mass marines You're going to hit. Why would he recall? He killed all the ghost? He's like 15 storms remaining And he goes like, his entire army is bruised I'm destroying his natural Now would be a great time to recall my army home And do nothing again You've got to be kidding me This actually can be real life. this actually can be real life I love that the Terran just completely got blasted in the fight and he's like oh you know it's time for me to move on the map again there's no way there's no way oh my god what a huge error by the way out of Assistall if right now Assistle had this entire army positioned over here guess what would have happened to this army would have gone down real fast oh what a huge error out of him that's so dumb God I wish he's an entire army was over here Actually would have won him the game Here you see it guys It's a predictive moves, except he only did it when it wasn't necessary. Now it would have been great Only his entire army is there Okay, here comes to Pylon This army, actually, Terran's macroing really well Like, he loses a fight and then just spends his money This is a foreign concept to assistal who wins a fight and then decide, because last fight was so easy, easy I can probably cut the spending a little bit more even. This is what tends to happen a lot in companies as well, is that if your department functions too efficiently, is rather than thinking, hey, this is a very efficient department, let's give them more resources, which they then can spend efficiently, people tend to cut the budget of that department even more because they already do so well with so little money And then they send more money to the departments which aren't efficient It actually true There's a word for this, but I forgot it Ah, idiocy That's the word I was looking for No ghost in this army, which means that storms are going to be absolutely bonkers broken here in this fight Good storms as well to start with It's one tour completely. Hello, Storm! How are you running away with six full energy Templar against 30 Marines chasing you? That doesn't make any sense That actually just doesn't make a storm Storm again, please Storm everything Just blanket it in storms Just blanket it in storms Running away from Marines, when you have high templar, it just makes no sense It's like if you're a sniper and you see a guy running towards you with a knife, like 2,000 meters away from you You see him just coming and he has a sign saying, I'm coming for you, sniper And then rather than shooting him, you start undoing your position you know, you start packing up Like, all right, guys, I'm done. This guy with the knife is coming for me He's like, the storm is honestly, is the ultimate tool That's not a good move command Still a better fight, though, than the first fight that the assistal took He just doesn't use his abilities Okay, here comes the storm A couple of feedbacks also could work He just morphed Two full, well, half full High Templars to morph into an arcone I didn't like that 3K in the bank 1,700 gas This is banging This is actually banging And he's going to move across the map and try to kill his opponent Worker count is equal But he's on three base The other guy's on five So the income is better for the Terran Okay, storm. We can storm We can still storm There is still a storm The storm has now disappeared There's no prism ever with these armies either So reinforcements are just something that happens at home, you know? A mothership The master of the army composition does it again He looks at his opponent's army consisting of tanks, marines, marauders and a ghost And he thinks to himself, the best way that I currently can spend my resource It's not on immortals, disruptors, colossi, more Templar, Dark Templar with Blink, zealots, sentries or stalkers Yes, I named every single unit, bar the Stargate units, but it instead is to get an 800 resource unit that cloaks my army and does very little DPS. Now that is the type of army composition decision making that I just absolutely love I thought that he was joking when he said he has brilliant army compositions, but he really does I mean, this guy is completely lacking any colossi I don't even think he has a hotkey for disruptors And he hasn't built a sentry yet, this entire game No Free two armor, the sentry It's a hundred gas, two armor, extra for all the units in the Guardian Shield That's beautiful That is just beautiful I love this This is the type of decision making that I I wish I had in my life. This is like getting a, having the ability to get a full free right on like some scholarship to an Ivy League university But instead you decide to become a pro gamer in a 12 year old computer game in a genre that is that like RTS That would be some really bad decision making And that is kind of what we're seeing here from Asistel If this works, I'll actually be upset He just sieged up on a man's army I didn't even know it was possible That's like building a house over someone Or a prison Like building a prison cell around him Like, ha ha! Caught you against I'm going to damn flabbit. I should have ran away after I saw the bulldozers and the machines that build buildings coming I don't know what machines built buildings Dropped out of high school All right Storms Do we get them? Complete invisible army Gets everything he impede Loses the fight Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the king of the army composition Assist, this is long fight It was a long fight, dude It was a very long fight You were all out of PP, my friend All out of PP I didn't get my storm up? This is the level of analysis that I need in my life. While I'm floating 5K resources and having a mothership in an army, I need to think to myself, I wish that I could have gotten my storms up In this last fight, if he would have gotten the storms up, it wouldn't have mattered He was actually dead He was fighting into seven tanks Well, actually more There's like infinite tanks here This was not it And honestly, it's funny You know, you see Judeoot in the loading screen and you think, ha ha I'm going to catch this bad boy, but the only one doing the catching here was Judeo And he caught some MMR Assistol, let me read your thing again because this is mind-numbing to me. I admit that I'm a low-level platinum two player, but even at my skill, Terran shouldn't have won this game No, that's incorrect, especially at your skill, Terran should have won this game Because at your skill, nothing is happening You do nothing You're floating money You're watching two DTs run into a turret for a minute straight and then you stare into darkness for another 50 seconds You had good storms and good army compositions There were some storms which were good Well, now let me say it like this Almost all the storms that you cast were good But you just didn't cast a lot of storms. This is like if you're a football player and you have two shots at the goal and one of those goes in, you know? You look at the statistics and you say, well, you know, I shot twice and I scored once It's 50% I had a good game And then your coach knocks you out because you also decided to not shoot 10 times while there was an open goal straight in front of you Like, technically the sentence that you had good storms is not incorrect or false, but in the context of the game that we just watched, it is just not very genuine to say that you had good storms It had good army compositions Well, you didn't have multiple compositions. You had one composition with Stalker, Zeal at Immortal Arcon, and you added Templar and there was one or two colossi at some point as well It was a fine composition, but there were no disruptors Immortal count was lacking once the tanks were out Immortal count was lacking once the Thor's route You never transitioned into carrier either, which you could have done if you wanted to So, I mean, it's not really, like you just built every unit that Toss had, except the San three and then you went, ta-da, good army composition Also, you didn't build a disruptor So actually, if I were to compare you to other toss players, it wasn't that good of an army composition. Like, the Terran also didn't have the greatest composition, but you also really didn't So on the army composition, you're going to get a big fat, you lied, stamp, because you lied You lied to me It wasn't a good composition At the last fight, just because I didn't storm him, I lost the game in an instant Now, I'm going to, I'm going to play this last fight one more time Okay, I'm going to just play this last fight one more time And you can tell me if you lost this fight because you didn't storm, okay? I have a feeling that wasn't quite a case So here comes the mothership Please note, 72 army supply against 113 Okay, let's see what the storm. You fly into or you walk into six tanks You move command forward You move command into the other guy, you catch an EMP with your entire army, all of it You clump it up so that the EMP can hit everything at once And then also you don't storm If you would have had 15 storms, all being covering your opponent's army, you still wouldn't have won the fight The other guy literally had 11 tanks There's 11 tanks in this army with plus two vehicle weapons The issue here wasn't that you didn't storm The issue was that he beat you already and you thought you could still win This is not the reason why you lost. So you probably wanted to, oh, Terran can win games instantly and Toss needs to keep pushing like little damage out No, you, my friend, were just dead This is, this is not it Your midgame engagement in which you recalled should have ended him but didn't Because you recalled Like, obviously It's like a boxer saying, I could have Catoed him, but I stopped hitting, so he didn't get Catoed He's like, yeah, so keep hitting Why didn't you do that? Also, for that, you lied again Boom! Well, technically it's not a lie It's just, it's just so weird to say It just doesn't make sense They're technically not lies, but they're It's just wrong It's just wrong You, my friend, it's not Inba. It's not Inba Taryn is not broken, and this Taryn didn't play that broken, and you had good chances of winning you, you just sucked That's the reality of things Okay All right, that's going to be it for today's episode of Is It Inba? Or do I suck? I hope you had a great time If you did, don't forget, did the like button, subscribe to the channel Hopefully we'll see you all next time for a new video Bye-bye."

        "text": "Dear Kevin, I am your big fan from China Recently I've been struggling against TVZ, which I believe that Zerk is just so in balance I tired to improve my TVZ skills, so I had this replay with my friend Since he promised to have a macro game, I decided No Scout and early 3CC with Elliot and Benchy This is just, the concept here is great, okay? This guy struggles in TVZ, so he wants to play some games TVZ with his friend And then he also says, do not do any early game aggression This is not how you improve You improve by actually playing a real game You could have also told your opponent to not build any banlings. I'm sure your TVZ would have looked a lot better in practice Oh, sorry, let me continue with the thing At the early in this game, I managed to do some harassment by the Hellions He lost nine rounds and lots of links without losing any of my units I even didn't lose a single unit in the first six minutes Well, I do lost all of my halions and one of the bansies on the next harassment, but also killed seven drones I thought that his economic must be terrible, so I start to produce widow mines He magically created 18 banlings towards my natural, and I tried my best, but still lost 12 SVs. Even though he lost a bunch of Drones, it seems like useless to the Zerg Ling Bane are still all over the map Every single time I wanted to push out there will be his army attacking my third base My micro was much better than him that only sacrifice little Marauders can destroy a lot of Banelings and the Widow Mines also did a lot of damage Then here comes the Ultralisk I destroy almost the whole army of the Zerg and one of his bases by only lost two Barracks But when I go through the map there's more Ultralisk from every direction I know my macro is not good enough But so does he It must be the Imba Race help him to win. Isn't it, Captain? Name Jerry, race, zirk, league, diamond, server China This man, Jerry, managed to actually fill in the incorrect race on the form, so we're off to a racing start already I wish you lots of luck playing a game as difficult as StarCraft 2 if you're struggling with a Google form and what your race actually is But we'll forget about that Jerry here is the Terran. his actual complaint was a bit all over the place I think it had something to do with the economy maybe like he said that he killed loads of units loads of drones and he barely lost anything his traits always were fantastic and his opponent just kept having bigger armies so there was no real one big complaint but more just the trend of that desert eco might just be too good and you know the classic the classic one of they just reproduce too quickly We're going to have a look at that to see if that's true Jerry here's the Green Terran and he's playing against his friend, Y, K, H, D, a Zirk player So kind of exciting. I'm kind of excited here for Jerry And I'm believing this to be a banger of a game I'm really looking forward to the triple-CC opener as well without the scout because he knows his friend won't all in This is like doing a magic trick where you stack the deck We had this guy in my high school This is not a made-up story I know I lie a lot, but this is true We had a guy in my high school who would come up to you with a pre-stack deck and then do a car trick And then after he did the car trick, and we'd be like, hey, do it again. He'd need to re-do the deck again and stack it in a certain order It's like, it's not a very good trick if you need to prepare every single time And it's obvious that you need to prepare every single time So he could do this trick once every lunch break We'd ask him to do the trick every single day because we thought it was hilarious He actually later on turned out to be a pretty decent magician And I guess everyone starts out pretty weak That's kind of what Jerry feels like here You know, he comes up with the magic trick. Except in order to do the trick, he, like, everything needs to be perfect, you know? It's like, pick a card and you pick one card from him He's like, no, no, pick the top card He's like, all right, Jerry I'll pick the top card for you, Jerry I know you're a terrible magician, but here we go again We'll see what type of tricks Jerry has up his sleeve here, though So for the build order, actually looks good Especially for a platinum player It's going to be opening up with a Reaper into Marine Factory is quick Reactor should start immediately This is good stuff I'm, I'm, he's not platinum He's diamond I'm impressed, though 3,300 MMR on the China servant. This is a good build order He's going to decide to do a little bit of damage Gats the first drone yep gets a drone so control is good macro is good behind this cc is going up it's going to start rallying into the gas i hope because you did get a second gas jerry kind of want to start saturating that gas it is what it is it is what it is um orbital's going down is all honestly this start out of jerry here it's just looking solid if this was a game on rank roulette and i would have the guess what level this is I would say so far this this looks absolutely like a master's two, master's one build order. You know, everything is kind of tight There's not a whole lot of money being floated Sure, there's a little bit, but that just happens with this build You know, it's not the end of the world Moves back as Reaper before speed finishes as well I'm, I'm kind of happy with how Jerry is playing this And that is rare, especially when it comes to Chinese games I've seen a lot of Chinese games in my time And I always enjoy the Chinese games very much But they're very rarely are they standard The opener never is normal The follow-up never is normal The accompanying balance complaint form never is normal either Like there's always some special twist in there, you know. But my man Jerry, first of all, has a very, very British and American name and also doesn't play much like his fellow Chinese players do on the Chinese server, especially on this level Decides to keep the Hellions home for now It is a little bit odd So there is the two main openers that we have in TVZ, I would say We have the third CC before second gas, and then we have the third CC after second gas With the third CC after second gas, your goal is to deal as much damage as you can with your early game units, because you have less economy than you usually do We see Jerry kind of playing this like he went for quick triple CCC. He left a lot of Helians at home really been able to deny any of the creep yet or try to spar with some of these zirklings or well try to burn some of these zirklings it's not really sparring if one guy has a flamethrower and the other guy just has claws and wings it's not a fair fight but generally you want to be poking for it looking for damage looking for zircling skills maybe shooting down the queen something like that benchy is on the way like the build order is pretty tight i actually have to admit that but the the unit control has been mediocre now it's going to get a bar bunch of links here. Third barracks has been delayed for no real reason Should be at the same time as this barrack, as this factory building the reactor That way you can swap the barracks and the factory and then you have two reactors producing marines while you're doing this opener This is a really good start here This is a really good start for Jerry and Jerry didn't lie He said, Kevin, in the first six minutes I didn't lose any units, which to be fair isn't that odd as he didn't send them out to fight either That's like Switzerland bragging that they haven't had any war casualties in the past two centuries They also were neutral in every single major war that was fought. So yeah, it's kind of what Jerry did here You know, he moves out once at like 520, doesn't lose anything I says, ta-da, I'm clean The best unit control in the game Follow-up is kind of sloppier You don't want to be getting mines yet at this point You're really want to increase that marine production So your first two Madovacs, when they pop out, can immediately go with 16 Marines Now, we're going to just replay that here for a second So Jerry has a very good early game He killed 1,300 resources without losing anything That is good He has had good traits so far Okay, this is absolutely brilliant I love that I absolutely do love that. Now he's going to send them in and he sees all these links and he decides, well, I'm just going to lose them Kills three workers So he lost 700 resources here and killed, what, 275? That's a bad trait Now, what did Jerry say in his little thing? I do lost all of my halions and one of the Benchial on the next harassment, but I also killed seven drones I thought that his economic must be so terrible, so I start to produce widow mine Those are the two sentences that I want to focus on here Now, this doesn't make a lot of sense. The first thing here is that just because you have good traits overall doesn't mean that all the moves you made were correct Like, this is kind of like looking at this game and going, hey, I lost six Helions and he lost way more So all the moves I did must have been good No, the first moves you did were very good But afterwards, you basically completely threw it away It makes no sense It's like if you're playing a football match and in the first half you're up 6-0 and you end up winning 6-4, you could still say, well, we scored a lot of goals and we won the game That was good. But you still made a lot of mistakes in the second half And that's kind of what happened here for Jerry And he kind of tried to play it off like it was fine Like it's never fine to lose your Helians And I doubt this is actually enough damage to really say, hey, I'm glad that I lost those Helians Now, it's like, you don't really want to trade out Hellions because Helions are super important for the thing that Jerry complains about later And that is run-bys The Hellions and the Benchies that you use in the early game to harass lose their value as a harassment tool later on in the game But they're really good at stopping your opponents harass. Benchies, Helions, great at dealing with Ling run-bys, great at dealing with small amounts of bailing run-bys as well So you generally want to be keeping them alive as they allow you to move out with your main army Without Helions, it just becomes really hard to move out with your main army Behind this, Jerry also is just floating a, well, kind of an enormous amount of units He's also getting kind of blasted here by slow bailings, which isn't great So he loses eight workers, and his opponent is actually really far ahead. like this entire sequence if I when I read this in in Jerry's little book that he wrote to me it felt like he was in a great spot after this because he did so much economic damage he killed 17 workers lost all of his aliens and his opponent killed 12 workers and lost a bunch of banlings this opponent is on 70 workers right now and Jerry is on 40 I want to I had another sentence, by the way, that I did want to focus on in this little imbalance complaint for him He said, I did so much economic damage that I wanted to transition into widow mines. And when I read that, I kind of glossed over this and was like, oh, you know, that makes a lot of sense Because he said it with such confidence But these two parts of the sentence are not connected at all It is like saying I ate meat yesterday so I performed very well on the stock market or I did five push-ups this morning and thus it started raining like if you say it with a lot of confidence you might be able to trick a lot of people but saying that you did a lot of economic damage so you went into widow mines makes no sense. Dealing economic damage doesn't mean that getting faster widow mines is a better call like you want to be getting marine You want a reactor on two barracks and attack lap on one barracks getting stim and later on combat shield while you're producing your first two meta-vacs Getting a lot of mines early on makes no sense because the ratio of mine marine is very important and there always should be way more Marines rather than way more mines Right now against this attack you had like six mines and eight Marines There should be like 16 Marines and two three mines and you would have a way better time defending your natural here I just wanted to plan the flag there where everyone could see. see it because he almost got away with it I put a mental note that I did want to call him out on that and I almost forgot about it because he said it with such confidence He is, he's quite an elegant writer, Jerry is And he got in my mind with his, you know, his poetic sentences And he almost got away with it, but not quite I caught you there, Jerry One o for me But keep trying, keep trying So in Jerry's mind right now, he's light years ahead He threw away six Italians to kill 17 workers total Sure, he hasn't been producing SUVs for a while And he's down 30 workers at this point. But in Jerry's mind, he's still very far ahead And honestly, he's up in army supply and he's up in upgrade He's only up in army supply because his opponent decided to not produce any units, even though there is 19 larvae at this point So a little bit of a surprising tactic here Now, we see this Ling run by actually doing very much Do note that this Ling run by has been dealt with I just want to show this to you guys, okay? This army that just moved back, moved back for no reason It moved back because Jerry only uses a single control group And it isn't even really a control group No, it is the F2. Jerry saw a threat at his third base, F2ed back home, and said, oh, these runbys force my army back Jerry, the fact that you can't multitask is what's forcing your army back The lack of your ability to have more than one control group is forcing your army back The fact that you lost all of your helions in the early game is what forced your army back There's three reasons and none of them have anything to do really with the run by The run by seems to be the reason, but the actual reason is your incompetence Now, these mines do trade well with these bailings, I have to admit These are good traits Not the greatest hit of that bainling and this bain. Oh well, this mine is also going to get a decent trade A lot of banings are still alive And they actually start walking into marauders, exactly like Jerry told us This is great, by the way The fact that the banshee is just in this army and not doing anything else Like not patrolling an area, just in the army, no cloak Stim is mean He actually isn't using F2, by the way So he's just using a single control group He's, uh, because this army isn't moving Now, at this point, Jerry's had a couple of pretty decent trades However, he's completely unaware of the fact that he's still mining less than his opponent and it's just generally downing workers. His opponent has been casually tacking into Hive at the 10 minute mark while floating 2K resources And this is something that I find hilarious that often happens, but Jerry didn't do Very often, especially Terrence, complain about this, they'll send me a measure like, hey, Kevin, like, this freaking Zerk was floating 3K minerals and I couldn't even kill him And they're not realizing that by saying that, it doesn't show that Zerg is in balance, but it just shows that you're incompetent If your opponent can get away with floating 3K minerals, that is just bad by you That means your builders aren't tight You're terrible at killing people and you wouldn't be able to smell an opportunity like if it hit you in the face. This is like Steve Jobs trying to sell you Apple in like 2007 for $10 and you going, ah, 10 sounds a bit expensive It's like, mate Like, it's already a big company, you know? No cancel on the command center Some bailings being wasted there in the orbital as well And honestly, after seeing these traits, I understand why Jerry does believe that he's a hat I would also believe that I was ahead if I had seen these trades So far, by the way, Jerry has only lost 22 workers Now, you might say only 22 Yes only 22 We're 12 minutes into the game and he's on 53 workers. If you're on 53 workers 12 minutes into the game, I'm expecting you to have lost like 80 workers at this point, okay? There's no reason for you to be this low in workers, 12 minutes into the game as a Terran who also has mules Ford base is extremely delayed He's one too many barracks for production, but, but, well actually he has four too many barracks for production So, The way you usually work in TVZ is that you get five barracks, two factory, then you get a fort base, then you add the three barracks He got these barracks after he built a fort CC and his Ford CC got cancelled. And also, if you are floating money and you can spend your money, I always say it's completely fine to add more barracks. I rather have you spend your money than have it in the bank and not being used whatsoever. It's better to just spend it in a barracks. And then once you get better, you can kind of scale down that amount of barracks. So you might want to make fun of someone for that might want to say, hey, that's incorrect. But actually, if you're playing at this level and you have trouble spending the money, no, that's completely fine. Now, this is the magical fight that Jerry told us about in his legendary poem that he wrote to us. He said, I killed two bases Or he said, what did he say? I'm going to need to read this again God I want to push out I destroy almost the whole army of the Zerk and one of his bases, but only lost two barracks He kind of romanticized the how this fight went, I feel like Because once again, he didn't really lie or not speak the truth because he did take out his opponent base and he did well, he lost three barracks and like six SCVs and the Zerk forced a lift off So it wasn't completely accurate, but he did kill a large barric of the Zirk army and he took out a base. The problem is that this was the sixth base of the Zirk was busy losing his third base Zirk was still mining with a hundred workers over five bases and Jerry also didn't really kill the entire army So it's a little bit disgenuine, I think, to say that you took out a base and hardly took any damage at home Like he hasn't been mining from this third base for the past minute now It's not like this was a super clean trade either It's not like he just destroyed the reserve army and still max No, it's like barely at 140 supply Doesn't have the minerals to start three three upgrades Like he's in a bad spot. I wonder if Jerry watched the replayback of this game and I have a feeling he didn't because the situations aren't really as he sketches them You know, this is this is rewriting history. Usually history is written by the winner but somehow Jerry managed to get his hand on a pen and write down this epic war story takes out the rocks Jerry always hated rocks hated them so much as a kid as well he's going to take out a lot of these ultras actually this is really good for Jerry and the army value or well the army supply is actually in Jerry's favor at this point he's controlling there's no mines in this army and he is floating 1400 minerals but there's actually some potential, especially if this is off-cream Trying to get to the METAX by baiting, wading, wading, wading, walking through the banlings. That would be the word that I was looking for, slashing his way through the banlings into the Matax Didn't quite work A lot of the units did end up falling We still just have a very nice income here for the Zirk at this point Mine should burrow, burrow, burrow, burrow Don't burrow He's still going to get the Ultralisc And at this point, you could say that, yes, Jerry is behind and he's not in a great spot, but he still has a decently sized army His opponent is making a lot of mistakes and taking a lot of bad fights Like, let's be real here His opponent is down 14K in the resources lost That's generally not a good thing. His opponent also keeps kind of move commanding links and other units into his army For a second, I was afraid that Jerry didn't have a hotkey for burrowing these widow mines, but did manage to get it here We're going to see some decent kiting as well And once again, he's going to take a fight that honestly isn't bad Like, none of these fights have been bad Well, that's unfortunate Lose the planetary Doesn't have a backup CC either 3-3 isn't quite done yet Like, the fights haven't been bad He's just been mining a lot less Because while Jerry was busy killing his opponent's sixth base, he wasn't mining from his own third. With another little attack here, Jerry once again, probably feeling like an absolute multitasking god As he sends six metaphics to the left side, takes out the seventh base of his opponent Meanwhile at home, he's valiantly defending against his Ling Ultra run by as well Actually going to be able to dish out a lot A lot of damage That's all good It's actually just kind of dead, isn't he? I'm just looking at this and I'm thinking, Jerry, why are we still in the game? Then I see the Zurg lose eight Ultralisk against 10 marauders And I kind of understand why he stays in as well. It's like a double-edged sword, you know? It's like you don't want to waste your and your friend's time, but you also don't want to let him get away with taking this type of fight so I think at this point if you know your opponent has this bottom base and took this base you kind of assume that at least these five were taken so you're playing against five base while you're mining from two patches in your natural and one patch in your main it's a little bit optimistic and perhaps even naive to believe that you still have a chance in that type of game but then again I think the word naive and optimistic, might be the two words that describe the Terran population as a whole the best. I mean, if there's one race that likes to stay in games after the game is completely lost, it definitely would be the Terran race I like Jerry leaves without Gigi, by the way, here That is a big move as well Imagine being Jerry's friend and getting the message from Jerry It's like Jerry just lost three games on the ladder against Zirk and he goes, hey, buddy, you want to play some custom games? And you're, yeah, sure, that sounds good I have some bills I want to try And Jared's like, no, no, no Not allowed to rush, all right? And then it was like, all right, no rush, whatever You play a macro game. Perfect macro game, like very good macro, economy, many bases, no crease threat, but whatever, you win the game Then he leaves without Gigi and blocks you on Skype or, well, the discourse or whatever people use these days, zoomers Jerry, not the greatest friend All right, let's just think about this game. here for a second and let's divide this game into a couple of sections so the first one is going to be game awareness i'm i'm going to name this game awareness just the the reality that the game is in and being able to connect to that reality okay jerry seems to not be bad at this he just seems to lack this capability whatsoever he is out of touch with reality jerry kills four drones with his and he believes he should be able to move command across the map and collect his free MMR That is not quite how it works. If you kill seven drones and you don't build SDVs for 12 minutes straight, most of the time you're going to find yourself in a bad situation, which is also what happened in this game You're constantly unaware of the position you're actually in You seem pretty delusional about what you need to do in order to win and what your opponent needs to do in order to win. If you're down 50 workers and you don't realize that or if you're staying in a game where your opponent has eight bases and you're mining of three mineral patches total with 20 workers and you believe you still have a chance, it might be checked to get that, you know, just to check at your local doctor's office to make sure that everything's okay in the, you know, in the brain up there So for that you're going to get a massive, uh, it's not there stamp Just game awareness is not there Then the second thing is the micro Honestly, not too disappointed with your micro For your level, you controlled your units fairly well. The splits weren't great, but you managed to get good fights throughout the game We can see that in the resource lost, you end the game up 13,000 I'm counting that correctly, 13,000 resources, even though you have technically a worse army, as you didn't get any ghost or a lot of mines or a lot of liberators Well, your opponent was on banling, Ling, Ultra Like, that is impressive and I'll applaud you for that So for that, you get a thumbs up from me And those are rare, so put it on your wall or something like that Hmm Then the third thing I want to talk with you about is macro Your first four to five minutes were fantastic Actually, great. For diamond level player, this is what I want to see You follow the build order and you got it right right until the point where you needed to build a third barracks and swap that with the factory After that, it felt like you just fell apart The moment you started controlling your units on the map, you just stopped doing anything at home You didn't build SCVs, like the units that you're supposed to build didn't come out The amount of units that you had felt kind of low as well, and the order of the buildings didn't seem to make a whole lot of sense as well. So on that, I'm also going to have to give you the stamp that it's just not good, Jerry I like you and I like the story that you sent me, the page of text But it's just not good enough, Jerry We need more than this in order to compete with Zirk player So for that, you're going to get a suck as well on this little midsection That leaves us with two negative reviews and one thumbs up, which It's more like a participation trophy, you know? Like, it wasn't great, but you didn't suck too hard either So put it all together And you, Jerry, you just suck Zurich isn't imbalanced You're bad I'm sorry It's the way of the world. It's the way of the world All right, my friends That's going to be it for today's episode of Is It Inba or Do I Suck?

But if Black Nova does it, it's probably pretty darn good The other side we have Ferrer, who's going to be our Macing Terran, getting a command center on the high ground because he isn't scouting A safe and solid play, and you know what I love That is indeed safe and solid plays So I'm a big fan of Ferrer already I think this is the same guy that also makes the little round chocolate that you can buy in the shop This is the ultimate gift for people you don't truly know It's a Ferre Roche, I think it's called, or something like that When you don't know someone very well, you just give them a bag of these balls They look kind of fancy. They're chocolate Most people like chocolate It's actually the perfect gift I don't think there's anything better because what you could also do, if you know, if you think they might like chocolate, you could buy them like a mixed bag of like a Kit Kat and a Mars and a Twix and that type of stuff But it doesn't feel fancy, you know? Like you can get away with that when you're 16, but once you turn 20, 22, you get four of these golden balls and these nice little wrappers. they're going to melt you'll be the king with that gift trust me guys Ferrer Roche I think it's called made by this Blue Terran player and I have a look at these build orders though what happened with the drone actually I kind of want to know did he just lose it on the map he lost two drones already both of them to this Reaper I'm not quite sure what happened okay he's gonna go 14 links but he forgot his speed upgrade I think he realized that now as well I'm building my links already let me get the speed straight after So you see the Terran is going into Hallions indeed And it's getting a starboard. It's an actual builder out of the Terran except for the fact the CC is on the high ground, but and this third depot is way too fast But life is life Terran scouts this with his Reaper and says, okay, I see what you're doing I'm just going to get two cars out and be absolutely fine and also lose my Reaper at the same time And boldened by killing the Reaper, Black Nova decides to move across the map with slow links against the Terran This is an ambitious plan in general, moving across the map with links But against the Terran is very ambitious, because Terrans tend to open up with Helians And what happens when slow links meet Hallions? We're about to find out. Well, so far they're dying And they all go down And he manages to deal What is this? I can't count, 25 damage on this halion He lost 14 lynx and dealt 25 damage on a helion Let me just remind you real fast what my good friend Ben said He said, in this game my opponent opens with heliens, which I trade with slightly unfavorably with links That's quite an understatement here You dealt 35 HP on one helion and you lost 14 links That's like inviting me to dinner and warning me before and saying, hey, I'm not a great cook, but it's going to be edible And then when I arrive at your house, you serve me burnt cardboard. Like, I think this is similar skill right here, okay, the type of deceit that has been going on in this imbalance form so far Two extra factories are going to come down out of Fed Air I'm liking Fed Air's builder You can see that he's played Mac before You know, he has his little ideas down He's going to float his barracks to the low ground, gets this, what is it, this command center in the wall, extra factories already He's getting a liberator out for some harass This is just generally a nice start It's not a good build order It's not a tight build order, but he has a plan, you know This is a guy that has played Mac all his life. He comes home after a long day of, I don't know what he would do I'm making chocolate, obviously He's like, you know what I could really use is a relaxing game of Mac And he starts building Helions as his extra factories And Ferris is loving it He's having a great time here It's a couple of extra depots in the main base And he's having such a great time He eats a little bit of his chocolate on the side A little bit of the different taste chocolate on the left side Puts it back Continues controlling his cars Look at this Look at this Four Helions A Liberator Takes out the queen. Now this is a reaction speed as well I like that he pulled the links to this one it's like hmm I wonder what would be the optimal players either grabbing both queens grabbing a single queen or sending my links there and he decides to first send the links there and then a single queen to deal with the Liberator to make sure he can't even kill it that's just brilliant did manage to kill some helions already three helions and he is well continue Continuing trading, what did he call it, slightly unfavorable So far, five aliens have gone down and 52 links have gone down. 1,900 minerals have been lost on the side of the Zerk and 550 have been lost on the side of the Taron He's been trading four times worse than his opponent I wouldn't call it slightly unfavorable Back in the day I used to play football, if I would come home from football And my dad asked, hey, how did you do? Or how did, what was the result? I say it was slightly unfavorable He would expect us to lose 3-2 or 1-0 or 2-1 or a drawl, but we played better so we deserved it, so it was unfavorable He wouldn't expect me to lose 25-0, which is kind of what's happening so far in this game Like, you're down 25 goals You're down 15 workers. He has Hellions, which hard counter Lings It's just actually just a hard counter If you have pure Hellion against pure Ling, it is actually impossible to trade well with the Lings And as we can see, that's also not, well, this trade wasn't even that bad It's actually kind of impressive by him, losing that many Hellions It does end up killing all your Lings though, and now he's going to go to work on the drones Like, I would say that this game is kind of over at this point, okay? There is no real transitions you can make Well, you could go into roaches, I guess, so you can finally stabilize against these Hellions Get a lot of drones. Like these are kind of, this is the plan that you need to follow at this point You need to get your eco back or you need to kill him in the next two minutes Otherwise, you're going to be in a lot of trouble Your opponent scans you, see if you're building drones and also sees a lot of links building So you see that the Farer actually is a pretty decent understanding of the game I really do like that Scans, figuring out what his opponent does And as a result, he says, hey, he is getting more links Let me just continue doing what I've already been doing Because for him, it has been working For you, it hasn't been working. Einstein once said, the definition of insanity No, wait What he said was trying the same thing over and over again But expecting a different result is insanity It's the definition of insanity Is there something like this? I'm paraphrasing It's not a quote Paraphrasing Einstein said something like this Ferrer at this point would be called insane by Einstein And those are his words, not mine I would I don't know Yeah, sorry, Black Nova, not Farer Black Nova would be called insane by Einstein This is, like I said, his words, not mine I would never say something like this, but You do look like a bit of a special case here, Black Nova, so far You've lost 125 links You haven't achieved anything. You're obviously down in Eco The game has been going awful And the only thing you can think to do is to produce more links, which is the incorrect call We need to, well, kind of transition out of that The best way to do it would have been to get 10 roaches out and then to just drone up to 85 Because with roaches, you have some safety With links, there's no safety No safety whatsoever, my friend it's absolutely impossible You need to be constantly on top of your links You need to be controlling the well You need to set up surrounds You need to micro them And that's not really what you're doing. The way I would see it is imagine that you're a security guard Okay You have to defend a small building Let's say it's my house I hire you as my security guard and you need to defend my house The problem is, is that everything I'm seeing when I'm looking at you, is you're slow, unathletic, and I'm not sure if your eyes work correctly because the traits you've been taking so far, I can't imagine a person with working vision taking the same traits Okay? So I hire you as a security guard You are showing up with a unit, like a knife A ling is like a knife. In order to take out an intruder with a knife, you need to be on top of things, you know, because you can just punch you in the face, or he can also knife you I think that's a word And it would be an issue The roach is like the gun You could be an idiot sitting on your lawn chair in front of the door, waiting with the gun, and you're going to be capable of defending my house What I'm saying is, is that you should get roaches A very roundabout Don't forget it, guys Roaches kill people That's very dangerous Don't play around with those, all right Ooh, look at Hellbats Blue Flame Helions Taking out a spine That's big Do like that. A couple of Bains So he's kind of starting to anticipate how this fight would have gone, had he not morphed the Bains I do like that It does only decide the more of them 10 minutes into the game This kind of was expected in a way, you know, like that the halberts were going to come I mean, or at least the Hellions were going to show up again So I'm surprised that the Bains weren't here yet, but I do like that Baines are here now It means that he is learning from his mistakes of losing all the links before We're still on a drone count that is way too low. After you clear a push, often what you want to do is you want to drone up, especially if you're down 10 workers That way you can afford more units in the future And because you just clear the push in a very favorable trade, you should be kind of expecting that your opponent doesn't have too many units to currently attack you with You could also think that maybe now is the time to once again mess on links and lose all of them to halions And it seems like that might actually be your plan here As you walked into a wall here and you saw that there was only 18 heliants, How many is there? Fifteen halions. He said, you know what? Maybe this time, if I run in my links into all of his cars, I can actually take a favorable trade And as we can see, this is a trait that I would actually describe as just slightly unfavorable And yeah, yeah, slightly unfavorable If those bailings hit something, maybe it could even be fine for you, even This ends up being slightly unfavorable If you were referring to this trait in your imbalance complaint form, then I wouldn't have mine so much But so far, you've been filled with lies and deceit And also with very poor unit control That is a different thing We'll get to that later You also haven't really scouted much. You accidentally saw that there's a factory here because you forgot about this overlord I doubt you've seen it Like, this overlord is, I haven't seen it, seen it You know, your overlord knows and he's trying to send an email, but you haven't figured out how to turn on the PC yet, basically So what's happening here Okay, hive is coming down Now, there was one thing that you mentioned, and that's that your creep spread was quite good That's very nice, but it's also kind of useless right now because you don't have the eco Like, creep spread is the thing that comes last, you know? It's nice to have, but you have bigger issues And thus, I wouldn't be focusing too much on crux. Oh, this is a good surround Nice You actually got a good trade This was a very nice surround Actually, good job This was actually not bad I'm happy with that Yeah You should be focusing more on droning and spending your money a little bit Your opponent also isn't spending his money, by the way And that actually is to your benefit here, Because if Ferrer wasn't actually starting a college fund for all five of his kids in this game, you would probably be dead because he would be maxed out twice already But yeah, I'd really recommend getting, like focusing a bit less on their creep. I do enjoy seeing good creep spread also at lower levels, but it's very obvious to me that there's bigger issues here in your macro That focusing on creep seems a little bit perverse almost It's like buying a really nice carpet for your house and then not having a roof It's like, yeah, I'm not sure if the priorities are there It's not brilliant It's really not brilliant Plus three on the way for opponent You're getting good upgrades I do like that You're also kind of whenever you work with mutas, which you said you really went for Lingban Mura I mean, I read this stupid form again. Because my opponent has largely Hellen Cyclones, I transition into Lingban Muta and harass him with the mutas and kill bases where I can I think the mutas came out of the spire at a 10 minute mark or so So far you've built four in total Three have gone down and there's one here There's four more on the way You haven't harassed with it once You haven't killed a single base once either They actually have done nothing They've just been F-2 around the map with the rest of your army trying to aid and killing Helians Actually what's been happening and They've been doing a good job because helions don't shoot up. I feel like if you actually were controlling your mutas separately, these type of fights would be so favorable for you There's actually no anti-air for him There's three cyclones, that's it And he has 23 heliants If you would just separately control your mudalisk here, you should be capable of just fighting this army But instead, you just keep feeding links into his helions That's some nice hits with the bayonics actually, that was good I'm going to take back what I just said Okay, and now we get some control on the Moodas Okay, so you're not quite sure if you're controlling them, but yeah Let's take a look at this first person. Is this your first person? Okay, you're actually doing some Muraura I like that So we go up to 17 Murares immediately It's a little late, but I always say rather late than never You start going ham Now, while you're building Muda's, there's this quick trick For Zerk players all around the world, by the way This is not just for Black Nud But while you're building muras and you build a lot of muras, you notice that you're going to be spending all of your gas because muras are very gas intensive And even if you're on 10 gas, you'll be spending all of your gas You'll start floating minerals And that's great because this allows you to start building a lot of drones. Your muta, your mutilists are keeping your opponent busy on his side of the map So in that time, you can get drones out You go up to 90, 92, 93 workers, get up to 12 gas you can start preparing for your next transition if you want that or you just get so much money that you continuously can send in waves of banlings and muta lists into your opponent's planetaries and kill those That is generally the plan with link-bane muta You want to be safe with like 10, 11 mutas, then you drone up and keep getting more mutas and then you start building units again That tends to be the type of the larger strategical concept of the muta They give you map control. Okay Well, mines are going to kill a couple of these mutas Five mutas here have gone down, I think Which isn't great, but also isn't awful He actually still has almost no entire He actually has no units whatsoever This is a bit of a painful engagement I actually think if you were a micro there, you could have won Let's go back to that area Look at this So first of all, here, this wasn't great obviously no overseer even though you're playing as a guy with Mac The fight in general wasn't great, but you still semi-win And then here, imagine, like there's five helions, but none of them are here in this fight. Imagine you split off the lynx to kill the turrets and to kill the cyclone And then these mutas, rather than flying into the turrets and killing nothing and losing all seven of them, they could then later come in to try and kill some of these SCVs that would be really cool Just a really cool concept Or you could all together pass by this building, go into the natural while there's absolutely nothing there Also could have been a good play Instead, you decided to throw everything away You have a lot of money in the bank, once again So there's your opponent And people often, they'll look at this type of stuff and they say, well, my opponent also was floating a lot. Sure, but that just means that there was a huge opportunity here for you to win It means that even though your opponent was floating twice as much as you, you, he still either traded so much better or had way better eco that he still managed to win That actually makes you even worse in a funny roundabout way Now our opponent is transitioning into mass thor and the mutilis will get a little bit worse And this is the point where you would say, okay, now that Thor's are coming out, we probably need to start transitioning into something else. And from a comp like this, you could say, well, How about we actually go into investors and start neuraling our opponent? Or how about we go into investor ultra? So we use the ultras to push away Hallions, Hellbat, and the investors to neural Thor's and to just fungal in general And I think you'll get pretty decent traits with that Another thing that you could be doing is you could go greater spire investor Brutlord, but, or Investor Brutlord Viper, but it's kind of tricky to do, and you don't have enough mining for that yet either Like you usually only go into Infester Brutlord once you completely mine out the map because that army comp is too slow. But right now with like, you know, with Ultras, maybe you could have done something here, definitely Also trying to do something with you I'm not quite sure about your muta control Sometimes you do control them separately, but it feels like it's not like really controlling It's just you send them somewhere separately It's like you tell the links to stay at home so you can go lose all your mutas on the other side Like telling your mom not to worry when you're, you know, when you were a kid, your mom would ask you like, hey, where are you going, son? And you're like, ah, don't worry, I'm just going to the football pitch You know, and be like, ah, that's great. She doesn't realize is that all you do with the football pitch is just jump head first into the bushes That's kind of what you're doing here, you know? The links are like, all right, muras, fly away Then the mutas just go straight into, oh my god, she's full 20, more muras Go headfirst into these mines, which just doesn't make a lot of sense Usually you use links to tank the mine shields and then the mutas can go in to clear them But you tank them with the muras, which is a way more expensive unit And most of the time you still don't clear them And if you do clear them, well, they already got their value So it's not even that great. You're still relying too heavily on pure Ling as well Bealings really are the key If you want to go for this composition, they deal so well with Helbitz, well with cyclones as well Of course, Muras do fine against Cyclones majority of the time, but now you're going to get a surprise of a lifetime Actually dealing some fine damage, though, here Killed one base You said no matter how much damage I do So I think this is going to be the phase where you're going to be dealing a craptone of damage with these Muratis, right? So you took out two turrets You lost two Muras as well Killed a couple of workers. going to lose another muta kill another turret and lose maybe two more muras i think at the i'm not even sure if that was efficient like you were left alone with 25 mutas in a mineral line and you managed to lose i think five muta lisp you did clear all the cv so it probably was efficient but it should have been way more of it oh never mind we'll count this to the to that last trade as well good lord that's actual pain it's a classic as well just runs in with the links again Run straight in with the links, even though there's like 12 heliolians here Loses everything You saw this I just don't understand this. I want to take a look at this, first person I want to see if I can get into his mind, you know? Okay, so right now, what does he see? Wait, I'm going to take this thing away So maybe he sees something like this Okay, so he sees four, five Hellions, at least six he saw six Hellions seven okay he saw like 12 Hellions at this point and as a response he sends in all of his Lings into this army and loses all of them this doesn't make any sense that they were there. What did you think was going to happen? Like I can tell you everything about macro and you could have the greatest mechanics in the world float zero, but if this is the decision making that you're working with, I'm not sure if this game is for you And I'm not trying to be funny, but Some things in life just can't be thought Like, how many links do you want to lose against Hellions for you to realize that they don't counter it? Like, you've seen this happen a million times And yet you keep going, and I don't understand it And it's frustrating me Because I started growing to like you during this game, you know? You started mining more bases. And I actually do appreciate your good creep spread But then your fights and your unicorns And like why are we floating? 3K 3K right now We have larva available You've done the work of injecting Like just reap your rewards This is this is like you have a piece of land and you plant like some potatoes there And you take care of these potatoes You water them and I don't know what else you do with potatoes Just leave them in the ground, I guess They grow by themselves pretty much Put some fertilizer on the potatoes, you know And then you pick all the potatoes by hand because you can't afford a machine and then you just leave them to rot in your little shed. That's what you're doing You have so many larvae You have so much money You've done the work Reap your rewards Eat the potato Make vodka out of it I don't care what you do Just use it I don't understand It's frustrating me It really is Yeah, you're gonna use some of them, well, all of the larva Oh, no, not even all of the larva 12 larva again Well, it's fine No real good army composition here for you either You're going to hydras Good large son This is the type of unit composition that Loco would approve Is there hydras without upgrades against mass torque? I mean, I guess It's not going to work, right? It's Helian Hydra. Hydras are going to take extra damage of the helions And then the Tors are just going to destroy it as wise Without Vipers, this is a very ambitious project here, especially because there's not a single attack upgrade either for these hydras So we'll be working with three carapace upgrades, which means they'll take a beating from the Thor still, because Turks don't really care too much about armor upgrades Like too shot it anyway or whatever they do Okay, this is a nice little surround here If you were to surround not everything, that actually could have been pretty huge Their heads are just too weak This didn't work at all You did kill a lot of workers or maybe he just lost them for fun. How many orbitals does he have? Three orbitals only Doesn't he use Mules either, just scans He scans to look into the future where he can see himself winning Farad is a really cool guy God Absolutely legend I'm going to take an overseer here as well There's more Thor's on the way, obviously She's building Thor's as well Honestly, I would be doing the same thing, just Thor's and Helions If your opponent has so little idea about countering your units You can just do whatever Seems like so far Black Nova has just been kind of building bad units at every turn It's truly been the case Whenever you had to make a decision when it came to unit comp, it has been incorrect. It really has been That's painful 28 more links on the way And you know what the actual pain is that I really don't think his mechanics are bad Yes, this APM is not even that low It's actually 190 That's pretty decent Not sure I was going to flame him for that He's flat, 190 average APM That's great I know Protos players in top 50 GM that have less than this I think your macro is fine and your creches, absolutely bananas for this level, especially It's just your You seem to have no clue of what's happening in the game Like, why did you just build? 42 more links after you already had 67. If there's two halberts here, or two helions, you'll lose all of them And you know there's going to be helions Because there is at least one factory, which you were aware of, which are overlord, with a reactor You know about two factories with reactors, so you know there's going to be helions And then this just happened Look at this, look at this halberd Venerall Actually, I didn't do too much Tors almost went down And now the Hellions come in and everything dies The game just ends There's freaking 17 tours There's more tours than overlords, almost Not quite, but almost I think it counts as well You're still staying in Is your time not valuable? Maybe 32 more links I He lost 984 links. He's going to lose a thousand links in this He's going to lose You look at the situation, you think, okay, I lost basically a thousand links already I lost a thousand links And what is the next thing that he does? He just builds 60 more As a counter to an army, he already knows he can't beat He looks at his bank, he sees he has 5K gas, he looks at his army, and he should be capable of dreaming this fight at this point, because he's done this exact same fight about 15 times And here we go, he kills the hellbats, almost damages a Thor into the rat, lost everything. doesn't GG he doesn't Gigi that is one Thor with what was it 2 HP that's what made it unbelievable I'm going to read your thing again to reduce micro and ability to trade cost efficiently makes Taryn Mac absolutely Imba okay this is what he said to reduce micro and ability to trade cost efficiently all Taryn compositions trade cost efficiently again sir this is true for bio, this is true for Mac or tends to be true because banlings are extremely expensive and bailing is almost always a core unit of the Zerk army. What Zirk needs to do is to expand quickly, deny bases of the Terran and then overwhelm or eventually go into an army that can trade cost efficiently in investor, brute lord, viper, corruptor type of stuff Sometimes you can trade cost efficiently with that And there's some scenarios in which Lurkers trade very cost efficiently as well I'm not going to lie about that Lurkers are one of these others, but mainly against bio, not so much against Mac So this is a given fact that they're going to trade cost inefficient However, you really put the inefficient in cost inefficient You know what I'm saying? We're used to having resources lost being different, but usually it's like this In your game, it's like this. Every single trade you took was bad bar maybe one trade in the early game where you got like Ling Bain on the Hellbad Cyclone Every single trade was just awful And you kept doing the same traits again and again So if I were to rate you in three things, and those three things would be decision making, unit composition, and general macro Then we'll start with the positive one General macro was really not bad Your injects are quite good I like the creep red, even though you were floating at times And I think you didn't know quite when to drone, but I think that's more decision-making than macro So I think your macro, especially for your level, it's fantastic, fabulous You're quite fast. It's obvious to me You understand how to macro So big up to you For that, you're going to get a thumbs up from here, the good old Facebook like for you Number two, unit composition. If you see your unit composition die 50 times in a row and you rebuild the exact same composition, again and again and again and again and again like I can't help you in that case you need to be capable of recognizing when a unit comp doesn't work anymore you started this unit comp when your opponent only at halions you continued this unit comp when your opponent went heli and cyclone you continue it continued it when he went a helen cyclone mine when he went tore hellbat you just kept staying with the same thing and it doesn't work in order to beat your opponent's composition you need to adapt to your opponent's composition and you didn't do that a single time you just went with what you already had and you lost every single time every fight you just straight up lost so for that you're going to get a massive especially by hamster drawn sock stamp and then the third thing what was it again uh decision making your decision making is questionable. And when I say questionable, I mean, extremely questionable It was awful The fights that you decided to take were almost always bad, not only because of the unit composition, but also just because your units could be doing something useful somewhere else Your mutas could have been harassing and killing turrets quickly and flying out and bumping back in and flying out But rather than doing that, you decide to fly them into a couple of turrets and then a couple more thores, or you see that there's 25 Helions and you decide to run in with 50 links and you lose all your links Like, oh, no, awful Not good Your droning patterns were garbage as well You didn't understand when to drone. You didn't understand when to build links or when to build units Yeah, it just wasn't good And for that, you're also going to get a minus, I was going to say a minus negative three But you'll just stick with a negative three Otherwise it would be positive So on scale from 1 to 10, be a negative three You're off the charge in a negative way Put all of these three things together and you, my friend, get a big, fat, massive suck All right Nice Another case handled here in the Harstam IOTIS factory Thanks everyone so much for watching I did enjoy it myself, although it was hard at times to watch Black Nova, thank you for sending in the replay, of course. Much appreciate it If you also want your replay in here, don't forget at in the description down below We have a little form that you can fill in, write a nice, long message to me with a replay, where you really believe that your opponent did something in balance, and perhaps I'll pick yours We have about 200 or so, I think, of the, on the new patch that I still have to go through, but maybe I'll skip some in line We'll have a look Thanks so much for watching everyone Smash like, subscribe."

And Harzer is his in-game name of Alon And his opponent is called Heaven's Blade And Heavens Blade here is, I believe, a silver player Hamster will correct me if I'm wrong, but in the loading screen he was silver, so that's all I know The standard 14 pylon behind the mineral go down on the side of heaven's plate, and this is promising to be a banger I haven't done a bronze game in an extremely long time, and I'm curious to see if the level down there went up a little bit or if it went down or if it's still the same as it used to be First depot is being placed at a perfect location I do like that, starting a wall. If he builds the second barracks here, I feel like that like you're almost guaranteed to get out of bronze just by knowing where to wall Barracks was about 70 or 80 minerals too late But I don't want to be too picky when it comes to the built order This is an interesting one that I haven't seen before I'll give him death This is a classic three pylon plus gas before Gateway I'm supposed to, sorry, the Taron The Taryn is going to go into gas The gas is a little delayed as well The barracks is late, but all of that doesn't matter too much, as his opponent also isn't really opening up with a build order. Second gas is going to go down here, and we see a Probe Scout coming out, but it's going towards the wrong base And maybe he's just spotting for proxies and he gets a forge down I am way more interested in what this protest is doing right now, honestly Okay, second depot before CC It's not quite optimal, but I will forgive you Double gate, after forge, and after three pylons, and after double gas So, if Harzer had opened up with a Reaper here, the Reaper would arrive at something like 2 25, 225 there would be zero units The Reaper would actually just straight up win the game. Don't forget that Harzer is also scouting, except the only thing so far he's seeing is the complete lack of a nexus Okay Ah, okay Now, this is kind of a classic, honestly I've not seen this before, but it wouldn't surprise me if this is more common on the lower levels Just like this chronobo boost without building anything is here So he's proxy a Nexus on the top, even when his main base gets taken out, he'll still have this base That's the type of high-level thinking that I hadn't considered yet We had triple wrecks before the CC Okay, and he's going to go into double tech lab and then I guess Stim and Combat Shield and go for a push. Worker production is very mediocre from both sides Triple cannons This guy is an absolute magician, you know He's wanting you to pay attention to the fact that there's no natural, and he wants you to believe that that natural is valuable to him You know, he puts all of his defenses where there is no base And then this is just going to be mining for free This is the type of high-level mind games that I didn't quite expect to see in bronze, but we are seeing them right now and I'm loving every single second We have a type of a scuffed three wrecks opener without any workers So there's at least potential for a marine push. What happened with the SUV? Did the SUV go down or did he die? Now, he just went home So the SUV saw nothing in the natural, stood over here for about half a minute or a minute, then saw that there was cannons building in the natural I was like, you know, the main base, it sounds interesting, but is it really that good? You know, it's like when a new restaurant or something opens up and everyone's talking about it Actually, that sounds like a film scenario It's more like if a bar opens up and people talk, it's such a cool bar You go to the bar and no one wants to talk to you like in every other bar that you go to. That's kind of what that SCV probably thought about You know, you know what? I'm just going to stay home this time I'm not even going to try to go into the main base Get some type of scouting info there See, two more zealots on the way plus one is being researched as well Now, this Twilight Council could go for charge, and at the same time we have four minutes and 38 seconds in the game We're on eight Marines, 26 SCVs, and I guess Combat Shield is done, and Stim is on the way. So just to compare this with a build order that would be tight and would make sense, at this point, you can be on the other side of the map with about 21 Marines, 38 SCVs, Starport already started, plus one on the way, and Stim and Combat Shield All of this can be done with just way more stuff Just as a comparison to show you how poor the build order is that we're currently watching It's down by 10, 11 workers, it's down by, well, an infinite amount of units Starport is delayed eBay is delayed All of this, I would say, is really bad. If your opponent didn't open up with four pylon double gas forged into two gate into double proxy nexus, as we have the second nexus also going down on the opposite side of the map So even though Harzer's build order is really bad, his opponent's build order isn't even a build order They're not really in the same league there, you know? It's like if you're trying to play a game of football, my man Heaven's Blade is showing up with a baseball bat You're like, hey, you're not supposed to show up with a baseball. bat and he just starts beating you with the baseball bat and he just starts screaming this is how soccer works now you're a little European idiot and now you lose the game you're bleeding out need to go to the hospital heaven's blade wins the game congratulations and that's kind of the brilliance here of heaven's blade build order is that he's not playing by the rules and harser here is playing with those you can kind of feel that harser watched from tutorials you know he watched some some games maybe even and he saw Klam do something like this, or Maru, you know, it's two Terran names that he knows. He's like, you know what, I'm going to copy these build orders, or at least what he thinks these builders, or I'm going to play it Heaven's Blade, however, what he did is he read the back of the box He found the old box of StarCraft to Wings of Liberty in his dad's basement Heaven's Blade is a seven-year-old And this is the first game that he's playing I was like, oh, these cannons look cool on the box art Let me try that. now you have proxy some Nexus sure sounds good I bet Heaven's Blade in this game is having a way better time than Harser because Harser is sweating he's like I don't think I have enough units quite yet like he also has hotkeys you know he knows how the game works like he's boosting his Menevax force yeah boost is good always use it on cool down he's going to use it a boom the moment is ready again sweating it out with 69 APM average 300 right now he's 300 8 pm his opponent is on 3rd 32 average See if the average drops down to zero Is there a time where Heaven's Blade just stops clicking things? Pergier's game This is the weird scan. Is this scam? He plays it very safe Doesn't want to go anywhere, you know? He could have just checked with his MetaVac, but that would have been a little bit too risky Okay, it's going to go into the main base and drop behind the I kind of want to see what he's paying attention to during this drop He started this drop with like 800 minerals in the bank I wonder if he's ever going to look away and ever do something else Better than just control these units Oh I'm not sure if he tried to move and accidentally clicked onto the MataVac or if he tried to load into the Madovac and it didn't work. I thought for a second that the Marine got to a spot where it usually camped Now he's dropping again It took about 15 seconds as well while completely only looking at this army to figure out that there were units in the Medevac He hasn't done anything during all of this, mind you Mr three-time his APM He's just clicking his Marines and Marauders really quick Okay, now he's producing something I think that took about 45 seconds of nothing happening in the main base of his opponent until he dared to look back in his own main So right now he probably realizes he's owning his opponent What he doesn't realize, however, is that our man Heaven's Blade already has a second base prepared. And that's this one Forge continuing upgrades over here Plus one air armor You see this is a man with vision He can anticipate the future Harzer right now isn't even thinking about the future anymore because Harzor believes he won the game all already This man is getting shield upgrades for his potential carriers He doesn't even know how to build carriers yet Right now he's reading the game manual, sometimes pressing the F12 button He'll go like this He's like, huh, Protos units There's no, the Protostack 3. And he's just looking at this and he's like, huh, is there a way where I can get this at the same time as I'm playing the game? Takes like a screenshot, puts it in paint, then puts that on his second screen and sometimes just glances over He's like, okay, where do I want to go? just hovering over all the units, he's like, ah, the carrier, fleet beacon, capital ship, can attack ground and air Sounds pretty good All right, let's continue the game At the same time, Harzer sweating his butt off He's like micro, well, he's not quite microwing, but I guess he's Okay, I want to kind of first person this here for a second, okay? He's not controlling his units. He's not really clicking anything, but he had 160 APM during that fight He didn't build anything, I think I think these were slightly after-hide, maybe just before the fight And he just stood there and took it So he lost half of his drops against slow zealots No way, they had charged Excuse me Against charged zealots That's actually a big difference And now he's going to send out four more Metafax For our good friend Harzer, the floor is lava This guy doesn't get give a crap about using your resources efficiently It's like, I know that I could be using this for mules, these scans, and I could just send my metaphax there or just a single unit. And I could also just scan every single base And after seeing that it's completely empty, what is this? It's a triangle I could still just send these units into my opponents natural I've actually been floating about 4K this entire game as well, by the way Um, okay, it's gonna drop Lose a couple of Marines and he can just stim into this and win You really can't wait like with any amount of units He's one one and these are three cannons I'm surprised he went for the cannons first, didn't just kill the pilot but I don't mind it He's using F2 because all of his units just came over Has maximum energy on all of these command centers Start scanning again. She's this base, is like, now I gotcha And he's going to go to the next base after he takes down the cybercore I like that the cybercore in the main base, right now for Harzer, is the most pressing issue in his mind He's seen a base go up here It's like, I can't deal with it later The potential threats that might be there Let me just kill the cybercore and then take 20 seconds to load up into my Madovax 5 2K minerals in the bank currently, by the way no extra command centers, no extra production, no production is being used either, no armory or a second eBay, nothing. At the same time, our good friend Heaven's Blade might not be mining a whole lot, but everything that he is mining is being used very efficiently Look at that It's constantly been under 500 minerals, and although he didn't respond to him losing the main and the natural, right now he's actually, he's going pretty ham Harger with this drop might be capable of scouting this right-side base as well, by the way We have a large army here If he stims, he will just destroy this Yeah, this is a potentially a pretty decent fight here for Harzor Well, potentially, this is a really decent fight I also think we're almost hitting the three-minute anniversary of not building units. The last time that any of these barracks have been producing a unit It's been a long time ago Okay, now he sees on the mini map that he has scouted this base and he goes for it Still not building any units I wonder how high he wants Okay, here we go Starts four Marines after he hits the 6K mark It's like, all right, that's enough, guys I've had it now This Marine Marauder drop will be capable of taking out this nexus Now he loads up again, scans forward, once again, of course He was already flying there, but rather than just seeing Did you scan a second time on the same way? No, he just starts scanning all the bases, I guess. He's like, okay, that's interesting So right now he knows of almost all bases what their status is, except this base and this base But maybe he's not aware that these are mineral patches that can be mined from Maybe he thinks they're just for show or something like that Rather than attacking, by the way, into these cannons with his army Actually, no, I like that He shouldn't have done it He should actually get all of his units together There's a lot of things he should be doing right now, but one of the main things should be getting all of his units together and then killing his opponent. He has 22 Marines, 15 marauders, good upgrades, or well, same upgrades as his opponent, and he has six metaphics If he attacks into this, the marauders will take care of the cannons, the Marines will take care of the interceptors, and it's going to be impossible for Harzer to lose this fight He also now realizes that perhaps it's time to start spending some of his money Has 5 4K in the bank when it comes to minerals I like this You know what? I've been whining a lot about everything our good friend Harser has been doing so far But I like the fact that all of this is nice and neat in a line. It's not the greatest StarCraft player, but at least he's a neat person Okay I do like that Okay Here comes the Stim Takes out the first cannon, takes out the second cannon There is three carriers out at this point as well Okay It was a very painful fight He decided to lift up here in the end So he decided to go for the mothership rather than There was energy available for a scan He could have scanned and just killed all the interceptors then scan three more times and then probably another time. Instead, what our good friend Harza decided to is he wanted to, first of all, I think he started right-clicking this pylon, then he tried right-clicking the mothership and done, he lost all of his marines to carriers Then he stayed around with all of his marauders taking out this right-side assimilator, rather than running back home or maybe scanning and trying to take out the main base or it is the main nexus Now we have a three-carrier counterattack and there's nothing here There's nine Marines There's no Vikings left His natural is going to die He is building some extra infrastructure finally, which is a good thing. I always say that whenever you have a lot of money, it's always good to build infrastructure, no matter how much you already have But if you're floating 5k, it's probably worth it to just plump down a couple of extra barracks or if your pro-lose, two, three extra stargates, you know, you need to be able to spend that money when you lose units Okay, this is a, this is a better fight It's going to target down all of these carriers, or at least one of the carriers, and maybe eventually I'll be capable of getting that second one This still went a lot better than the first fight in which he killed an assimilator and lost about 75 supply. Now he lost about 15 supply and killed a carriac So it's a progress of a kind Vikings are not being produced anymore I really do like the priorities here on the MataVex He's like, huh, my base is under siege by two carriers The one thing I really would like is some extra healing for my eight Marines, rather than getting air units that are actually good against carriers Oh my God, he hues up a punch I was wondering where all the money went, but I guess now we know Interceptor still could die as well, by the way just decides to stim and kill the interceptors, that would also be good He's going to go for the mothership Heroic attempt here on the mothership's life. He's going to get it Except now he doesn't have enough anti-R anymore to take out the carriers One does start to wonder whether he is aware that the scan can also be used for detecting rather than just for scouting bases while his units are already there I have my doubts, honestly I actually am starting to wonder if Harzer is, altogether aware of the concept of detection I mean, he is a bronze player, so it's completely viable, or completely possible that he just doesn't know about detection I remember the first time I played a game of StarCraft, I died against the Dark Templar I remember being so upset that I couldn't see this unit I was like, this is so stupid. I can't see the unit Maybe he's having a similar experience Maybe he truly believes the only way to get to the carriers is by right-clicking the mothership That would make the game a lot harder for all other races that are in Protos, by the way They really would make it out How would you beat DTs? Not possible, because they cloak by themselves I doubt Harser ever won a game against Dark Templar With the game being reset like this, though, Harzor now has another opportunity to show up his extremely high APM, triple the amount of APM of his opponent Let's not forget about that Perhaps the problem for Harser isn't that he's lacking in speed. I bet if we were to do an IQ test is that you get the reverse here. What we see in the APM wouldn't surprise me. Mothership gets built again. I do like that because so far it is being used as a great bait for any of Harzer's units. Harser actually has a pretty decent army. I think if Harser would attack across the map, he would be capable of winning right now. Of course, Harser isn't aware of that because he hasn't used the scan ability in a while. The magical scout. It only costs 50 energy. Has he built any MULEs yet? You don't see MULEs in units lost right? If they just expire. I don't think he's MULEd once yet. If you're harser and you're watching this, a mule is the guy that drops from the sky in the yellow suit, and he mines minerals for you very quickly Now, throughout the majority of this game, having minerals wasn't really one of your priorities because you had plenty, but in this type of scenario where you're down to 20 workers and you want some extra money I suggest throwing down a couple of mules Generally, it's a good call Anian pulse crystals Heavens Blade knows things that we don't He's just going to get it in case he needs to go for the Phoenix transition Bottom left side base, a couple of extra pylons I do like it And he's also loyal to where he started, you know. Very often when people make it into the big world, They forget where they came from, but not Heaven's Blade He goes back to his roots It's like his summer home Vises his parents, that type of stuff Gets any impulse crystals Wait, he didn't scan before going in? Oh no, he scanned it already No, he knew it was there Sorry How silly of me But he actually flew in without scanning first That's also progress of a kind I wonder if he taught him this trick himself during this game You know, it's like, yeah, maybe I don't need to do that anymore Maybe I can just drop That's cool to see Sixty Marines are going to be capable of taking out this base. And I guess this is some of the magical dropping that he was talking about in his imbalance complaint form He said, I dropped a bunch And his opponent hasn't dropped once Now, I know that Terrans like to brag about the amount of times that they drop, but dropping isn't actually that special Like just loading up your units unloading them, it's just, technically it's just one more action than A moving across the map is And if your units never returned, then perhaps just A moving across the map would have been the better option here So it takes out the one base, loses all of his units It's like, hmm, that wasn't great Let's see if we can do that trick again. At this point, I think Heaven's Blade, could he move across the map and win? Yeah I'm not sure if usually you can, but I know that if Heaven's Blade would move across the map, our good friend Harzer would right-click the mothership, and mothership might go down, one carrier might go down, but then there's nothing left At the same time, Heaven's Blade's macro is actually quite good Like, he's not floating a whole lot for being silver It's not unimpressive He's doing a lot better than his opponent, at least Plus two air weapons on the way as well I really wonder what he's clicking at this moment Our good friend with the high APM It's going to double expand. Did he get a planetary there? It's a good move So far his opponent has really shown him what's good with all these ground units This planetary is going to be very useful You know who would never make this mistake? Our good friend Heaven's Blade You know why? Because Heaven's Blade, if he would be playing Terran, He would click on this thing And what does it say? Can attack ground units Heaven's blade wouldn't fall for that Ah, yeah, yeah Hars are really lacking in the StarCraft 2 theory here Getting a planetary against carriers is not quite what you want I can't believe this, these type of games are actually being played on the same server that I sometimes play on. It feels like a bit of an honor, you know, that these guys play the same game at the same time period as I do Oh, here we have a scan Where did he scan? Okay, scans Scans forward He's like, ooh, that's safe He's going to scan again He saw one immortal That's a threat Back home I like that He doesn't want to lose his units another time Of course, he didn't know there was going to be three carriers in between him and that base, but that was a lucky escape So we're not going to see too much more I'm afraid of Okay, Robo Bay, Twilight Council, plus to armor as well Two more carriers on the way being rallied towards. where's this top side base You see, already has this base secure Still superior income here for the Protos player as well Now, what we could be doing is while we're behind, is trying to really get our eco going by getting a couple of extra bases I do like that Turn these bases into orbitals quickly, start throwing down some mules, just mainly they're starting to throw down some mules And I think these SUVs that are being built at this point could have been built a very long time ago Like we were on 23 workers for no real reason for an extremely long time Okay, now we have an orbital coming down here I don't think we have seen a single mu. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh Yeah, yeah Okay, so he is aware He knows how it works He just hasn't been using it yet Weird Very weird Okay, ship weapons level two on the way as well. It feels like he just kind of stopped macroing for like 12 minutes or so and now decided it's time again maybe there's like a switch on the side of his head and he presses if the flying drops into carrier switch that's the one side of the switch and the other one is building SUVs and units I much prefer to building SUV and building unit switch I have to admit these triple carriers here on the top side yeah don't think these are going to be capable of doing very much as long as they're over here I also like that Heavens Blade just kind of keeps expanding, not caring whatsoever about losing bases. I guess if you have friends everywhere, like Heaven's Blade probably has, like the absolute chat that he is, you don't really care if you lose one or two friends because there's more anyway You know, there's more efficient to sea It's the same for Heavens Blade There's more mineral patches on this map He says, you take out my main and my natural, I already have proxy bases You take out my proxy basis, I have my main and natural again Like this guy truly figured out the game Here comes another double drop So switch has been flipped again See how these are going to fare You're going to fly into some carriers Did he scan anything? This is one hell of a path. Oh, it's going to spot this base Let's take a look at these lightning quick responses Okay, sees an empty base Drops the MataVX Stimms Wait still, everything is unloaded Now he stims Or now he will stim There we go That's big See if his opponent cares Oh Here comes Heavens, Blade This is a good escape Well, almost was a good escape If it would have been slightly faster, that would have been a really good escape Now he's going to get into the main base He's going to be capable of doing so you see Look, 3K minerals again It actually is how it works He just doesn't do anything while he's dropping He literally has a switch on his head. Not only if he could control that switch himself It seems like it's a timed switch Very unfortunate He's going into Thor's right now He keeps building marauders as well I wonder why he does that Like right now, the last unit that he has seen that was on the ground was this immortal when he scanned this base before flying in with the two meta-fax He was like, yeah, that's too much Maybe he's just really afraid of Protos ground units It is completely possible Okay, 4K in the bank As Heaven's Blade right now is getting rid of his decoy bases His main once again is going down His natural is going to fall This base will fall eventually. And he says, you know what? I'm just rebuilding these bases anyway So I don't give a crap This is about the mine out You think he forgot about the carriers? I think he might have forgotten that he set the rally point over here I kind of want to look at Heaven's Blade first person It's a lot more relaxing I bet he's eating at the same time as well, Heaven's Blade Probably doing something else at least, you know? He just, oh, now he sees him fly somewhere Surely No, hey, he's still not aware Or maybe he's trying to hide the carriers It's also possible Cues up six probes Goes to the next nexus Chrono boosted Oh! Now he sees him No, no. He was just changing the location of these probes This is great to watch Okay, queues up five probes after the chrono boost is almost ended This is absolutely marvelous I really like this God I wish I could play like Heaven's Blade I really wish I could I bet this guy's having way more fun than I do in all of my games Just rallying up carriers And sometimes he just finds a carrier bank somewhere magically on the map Maybe he doesn't know how rally points work either It is possible And sometimes he just right clicks and then the rally points get set for the rest of the game Chrono boost flying around Okay, here we go Another five-man drop. Because, ah, he scanned and he saw these cannons He was like, ooh, that might be dangerous I only have 3-2 bio And these cannons are all, well, kind of vulnerable, but I wouldn't want to kill them by myself Let me send the rest of the forces as well As Thor's at home, has no upgrades for Thor's, though, and continuous upgrades for these It's getting drilling flow upgrade Maybe not even that bad against interceptors Yeah, it's not getting upgrades for these Thor's I also think he has the incorrect mode for the Thor's currently, but it could be wrong Okay, he's going to absolutely destroy this It's carrier still here on the top And this is an insanely high-level game. I feel my brain moving slower as well Hop, hop, hop Picks up the drop Goes back home Turns this into an orbital Still 8K minerals in the bank currently Could start or could try to start adding a couple of barracks or starports Okay, so he sees that it's triple carrier Now surely we unload and attack into this No, we scan a different base where he isn't If he goes in here, this is the play of the century I Does he not understand that the other guy can also respond to things and just fly his units here? here Like you scan that the army is over here and your brilliant plan is to drop this base and then pick out. Okay, well, this is actually a smooth move I'm not going to complain by this There's a freaking James Bond over here Oh no I think Harzer might actually ruin it for himself here He scans the carriers I think, I actually think there is a chance that up until this point, Heaven's Blade wasn't over Nah, he's been chronobo boosting this cybercore though I feel like now they get added into the army Now our good friend Harzer is in trouble What was he going to do with these Vikings? What actually was he going to do with these Vikings? I'm very curious Now I want to do a little bit of simple math here, okay? Before the fight. I just want to have a look at everything that has been going on So, we have an army supply of 138 for the Protos player This army consists of 18 carriers with 3-3 upgrades, okay, 3-3 upgrades, and one shield upgrade Against an opponent who has 129 supply, but of that 129 supply, 11-medevacs are built, so that is 22 supply in Metafax For only 29 Marines, and you might say, well, only 29 Marines, there's also 14 marauders Yep But marauders don't shoot up So these 14 marauders, again, 28 supply, also isn't useful So realistically, this is more of a 140 pure carrier against like 100 supply of anti-air And also, this anti-air only has 2-1 upgrades. So he's down three upgrades and the ground only has 3-2 so it's also down and upgrade I'm very curious to see what's going to happen here Stim isn't being used Stim still isn't being used I think he lost 10 supply before he started attacking, and all of that supply was anti-air Okay Scan now is being used for the first time One carrier went down, as the Vikings focused on the interceptors as well And he got absolutely decimated here Completely destroyed Not even close Now I hear you think Kevin Oh, he just leaves like this? Oh yeah, to be fair, he was pretty dead And the other guy lost like a single carrier I do like that he left. I don't like that left without Gigi But what you can say here is that he didn't really have the correct army composition against a pure air army Perhaps getting almost 30 supply and marauders isn't quite what you want against pure air On top of that, maybe you want to add a couple of ghosts Ghosts reduce all the shields If you get two, three extra ghost for a very low supply cost, you can EMP everything, including interceptors Another good trick is to stim This increases the damage output of all the units that are shooting the interceptors. Trick number four would be to target fire with the Vikings on individual carriers rather than Vikings just going like this, looking to see if they can hit another interceptor Also not quite ideal majority of the time So there is a couple of things that I could give as advice before we truly get into the nitty gritty stuff So there you have it Now, if we get into it, your balance complaint from, what did it say? Protos late game air units are inba I'm playing a game against ProDoh where I drop him several times in the game Okay, I understand that you drop him several times in the game, but dropping someone several times in the game isn't actually something that is necessarily positive. Sometimes I try this when I talk with my girlfriend as well and I say, but I cooked the past three days when she tells me to clean something up Forgetting that everything I cook is absolutely inedible It's nasty and disgusting It is a net negative I just wasted good ingredients And it's the same here with your drops You wasted potentially good units by throwing them away in a drop Some of them were good, but majority of them, you just kind of lost them and you kill the nexus and then they died to carriers I destroy several of his bases as he spreads like as if he was a Zerk player Okay? That doesn't really mean anything. But unfortunately, I am unable to stop him before he fills his entire supply with Inba carrier years Okay A really key word in that sentence is I Unfortunately, I am unable to stop him If we replace the word I with almost any other nickname of a Terran player in StarCraft 2, this sentence would be false You, however, were indeed incapable of stopping him before he filled his entire army's play There were multiple points inside this game where you could have just move commanded across the map And then, once you see his units, A moved Stim, A move, you scan to get detection That would have been it The first time, after you pushed him back, you could have done that. Before that, when you right-click on top of his mothership for whatever reason, you could have done that 22 Marines with 2-2, 3-4 Metafax there, and there was, I think, 3-4 carriers total You would have absolutely destroyed that It wouldn't have been closed All of the interceptors would have died and you would have killed him So when it comes to your game sense and game understanding, I'll give you, on a scale from 1 to 10, a 1 It's the lowest There's no game sense The second one, when it comes to the micro in the fight On a scale from 1 to 10, the micro in the fights, but it wasn't really there. Most of the time you used stim, which was good, but then you almost always right-clicked on the wrong unit or you didn't right click, so you just kind of stood there and looked Even in the early game against the Zellas, you just stood there and watched the fight happen without kiting back So for that, on a scale from 1 to 10, I also will have to give you a 1 And then if we think about your macro, there were times where you were floating 8K while looking at a drop There were times where you're floating 12K, 6K, K, multiple times throughout the game It seems like there was a switch there that you needed to flip And sometimes you just didn't flip it. And your macro just wasn't very good So for your macro on a scale from 1 to 10, I'll give you a 2 8 Put all of these together, 2 8, a 1 and a 1 And you, my friend, suck You suck very hard I'm sorry It just wasn't good Carriers aren't imba You just right-click the mothership It is what it is All right That's going to be it for today's episode of Is it Inba or Do I Suck? If you liked it, don't forget the it the subscribe button, like the video and hopefully we'll see you all next time for a new one Thanks so much for watching and bye bye."

        "text": "Dear Harstam, your content is always fun and I enjoy each one of them Even though your accent made it difficult to understand every word you say It's a good start, buddy I don't think he knows what he's signing up for This is not how you're supposed to Usually what you do in the first paragraph is you kind of warm me up, you know? You kind of do some I-O-Dis for-play, okay? Like, make me happy Say something like, man, you're the greatest content creator Then I'm going to go a bit easy on you with this type of crap If this is how you want to play it, all right Let's see how it is Back to the business Yeah, yeah, go back to business. Ultralisk is utterly Imba All they require is money And they will help shred through the Terran force This is a game of TVZ I played against my friend This is the first time for me to play against him He's about 300 MMR above me I played a little bit safe by opening up with 2-1-1 The early game macro was a little bit flawed with a delayed stim and combat shield But I think I did a fine job into the midgame I had some fair trades against this army, and although I don't have a brilliant multitasking ability, I still managed the macro to plus one plus one upgrade. Because of my micro, I went very aggressive to fight Zircon creep, and I managed to get a good trade of it I sustained this advantage until the plus two plus two upgrade Then the Ultralist game There were simply too many of them to micro my way out, and they cleared up my force Because of how Terran production works, I cannot pump ghost out of my barracks, like Zirk pumps out Zirklings from their hatchery, so I lost After this matchup, I felt like I had a huge advantage before being literally flooded by Ultralisk My friend also agreed with me, thinking that he was in a very bad position and he was going to die. So for the sake of me and my friend's judgment, is Zerk Imba? Or do my macro suck? Name, prophet Ray Sterran, League Diamond, MMR 3, 3,300, and the server is indeed going to be China All right, my friend, let's see what we have here You say you open up with a 2-1-1, your opener was fine, although it wasn't perfect It was good enough I'll be the judge of that for a 3,300 Terran playing against the Zirk that is slightly above you in a MMR Your opening better be a dang tight Look at that A little bit of an extractor trick here For the people who are not aware, the extractor trick is when you build an extractor. build an extractor while your overlord is building And then you can build one extra unit So your supply block at 14 out of 14 You build an extractor, which means you lose one supply Then you add a drone, you go back to 14 out of 14 Then you cancel the extractor and everything will turn red and it will say 15 out of 14 And then three seconds later your overlord finishes So all of it was kind of useless. People figured out about 10 years ago that the extractor trick actually is worse than just building a faster overlord at 13 supply but there's still some zirg that like to do it these zirk players are incorrect it's objectively worse there's nothing better about it so nice good start already but we're looking at them and these guys are writing a freaking book to each other sick all right curious mind is a very small map as well and it's also a map on which a split map is quite common or at least you have these low base scenarios five versus five base 5 versus 6 and 6 usually on the Zerk side Sometimes we see 6 versus 6. In that case, the Terran almost always wins because Tair units just tend to trade a little bit more efficiently Let's not forget about that It's actually true Accidentally plus the plus button there Parc is going to get thrown down in the main base So this is indeed a 2-1-1, or at least it looks a lot like a 2-1-1 And this guy really don't stop talking It's interesting Interesting Probably very good friends Also said it was their first game together I think that's very odd, no? If you're friends close in MMR, I always play against all my friends, even if they're way better than me I have one friend who haven't beaten in over three years His name? Cyril. Yeah, I just named after several I can do these things I'm a big boy Okay, wait, where are we? Second gas being taken This builder actually looks fine so far, I think Yep Barrags went down before the second depot Factory is going to get thrown down before the tech lab This actually looks like a real build order, which somewhat surprised me because 3,300 isn't the highest MMR He needs to start the tech lab immediately here, but if he does that, then I'm going to be pretty Ah, he's busy micro and the Reaper This is a classic Terran, especially at lower level Like, these are the guys that really believe they're insanely fast as well. Okay, like, these are the guys posting on the battle on that for him They're absolutely out multitasking their opponent And what it is is that they're just using one unit and they're floating like 1,200 resources at the 3-minute mark He was floating 400 while controlling the Reaper You could say that's okay, and then you would be wrong, because that's not okay Flooding 400 resources at the 3-minute mark, unless you're opening up with a quick triple C C B4 second gas, that's not actually okay It's completely forgetting his stim as well, which is kind of a big deal Like, this build is practically a stim timing It's a 2-1-1 stim timing So forgetting your stim is really bad. It's like going to a marathon and forgetting your running shoes It's like you really, or just shoes in general You really do want to have those things, you know Technically you can still go without it, but it's just going to hurt for you and for the people watching It's not going to be a nice experience The same here Stim delayed Metafx are going to be on the way soon Seven Marines are already out Have a good battle here, my friend But it's going to suck for you, honestly The layer being built on the side of the Zirk first to Metafx as well A lot of SEVs being produced, but still looks fine The rest of the builder actually looks relatively tight. What happened with the Reaper? Probably died a pretty sad that that I wish you could click it and see where it died but that's not possible Technology sadly not there yet But it's going up to 4 gas So most likely playing MudaLisk in that case Quick tip Okay, here comes a double drop. Now we see that our stim isn't quite done yet for another 35 seconds which means that this double drop is going to do well hopefully nothing because if it does do something that would mean that the zirk is not very good and that would actually really surprise me because slow marines are actually really bad like you could send like two and a half queens here and well you'd lose two and a half queens then but if you send like 20 links there as well and you'd be able to clean up there's 10 baines on the way Cirque believes there's going to be stim, but there's no stim, so this is just a pickup and he needs to go away. This actually was pretty important There wasn't that many units He probably could have at least cleared a couple of links Not having stimmed, there actually kind of sucked It really did But the third CC is on the way We have a follow-up During all of this, during this beautiful non-stim push, by the way, our good Terrant players now floating a solid thousand minerals 1,100 minerals at the 5 minute and 30 second mark And now he starts investing that into extra barracks and into more units that he can't build because he's also supply blocked So all of a sudden he spent all of this money, but none of this money is actually really being used. So if we just count how much money right now is not doing anything, we have 50 over here We want like a creptle of money over here It's like 200 minerals Let's just do minerals It's like 250 You have like, what is this? I can't do math Like around 400 There's refineries, extra barracks All of this money, I shouldn't have done the counting thing I knew it was going to end poorly for me All of all, they say with these depots and the eBay's Notice is being invested in anything that's going to deal damage to the Zerk player in the next few seconds Now he stims from a distance, starts running in Doesn't it have the Madox here. That was a slightly risky move, but I guess a semi-pick-up I mean, some of the Marines stay alive It's better than all of them dying, I guess But maybe that's why he's going here for, so he can lose all of him at the same time He really should not be dropping anymore at this point He really should not be dropping no more He should just be going back home and creating Marines Once again, during this very successful move, he was floating 1,200 miles. Often what you want to be doing, if you're a limited player, like this guy obviously is, no offense, but I can see that you're limited not only in IQ, but also in your APM, your mental resources are just a little bit limited That's completely okay In that case, what you want to do is you want to think about the things that give you the most return So right now, you dropped Marines first initially without stim that got you to float 1,100 minerals, get your supply block for, 45 seconds And then afterwards, with Tim, you went in, and I think in total you killed four workers, but you flowed it up to 1,200 minerals twice. It might have just been better for you to stand over here, kill this overlord, and then actually macro properly, rather than wasting a lot of APM, doing something that got zero return for you, but cost you a minute and a half to execute It's generally not a very good thing to do This was a nice bit if you hadn't been hit by the Boehling So it wasn't a nice split But the intention was there This is what my dad always told me when we went bowling I was really bad at bowling as a kid My dad would always say if you would have bowled a strike though, that would have been a really good throw. Sadly, you didn't and it went into the gutter again For a very long time, even when I was like 15 or so, I still played with these with the bumps on the side, you know? So it couldn't go into the into the side I was really bad at bowling Also, always hurt my wrist for some reason I really didn't like it They always thought I was a complete idiot at the bowling alley, though Because I should have there is a 15-year-old that needs the helpers on the side That's okay I wasn't ashamed And then I went practicing two times a week And after two or three months, I finally was capable of just getting the ball straight in the middle. A big moment for me I haven't bowled in years now I hate it stupid sport it's not a sport it's a game not even a game Starcraft is a game a real game bowling is like that it's also not a cool thing to do you know it's like I used to have like these parties back in the day where I can let the game play where like the kiss parties where you get invited for bowling or even when you're like 13 or 14 and then you always had the kid that would take his own ball and his own bowling shoes it was like all types of weird techniques It's like absolutely destroying everyone else It's not even fun, man Like, let us be. It's like 180 points I have like 23 total for like 10 turns Like, oh, leave me alone So that a nice fight if he hadn't been hit by the banlings Actually, he's still an okay fight You just had a lot more crap because your opponent had, I think, the lower eco for majority of time Also, he's floating a crap ton of money So that was cool That's a good move Generally a good move do like that I also like this stim Yeah, yeah No, I do like this You won the game here Congratulations The game has now ended It's over Well, unless you stand up It's still over, I think Like, he just has way more stuff. I'm actually very confused how he's going to be losing this game So we have similar upgrades right now Maybe these bailings are going to hit everything There's a craft on Marines over here as well There's a fort base on the way, second factory Like the idea behind this entire build has been pretty good The only problem Oh, he lost all of his tanks for free just now The only problem, I guess, is that he isn't producing as much But the Like, he's a lot of production facilities Yeah, it kind of Doesn't look too bad It really doesn't Metafax still alive Terran is still winning, in my opinion here What did he say in his form? What was he complaining about? I can't quite. call A little bit save open him Oh, he really hated the Ultralist That's what he was complaining about so much And he said his opening was a little, I just read it again, a little bit flault, he said My man forgot the stim with a stim timing, a little bit flawed All right Seven mutas on the way Oh, he's completely unaware of the fact Well, he's not unaware of the fact there's going to be mutas He actually knows that this spire is here, but he has no preparations whatsoever Not a single turret He's also saving for the next game or something like that because he's freaking nine mules that he could be raining down from the sky. You can have a scan for every single creep tumor on the map currently There's seven creep tumors and he's more scans than creep tumors That's not a good thing for the Zerg usually, but in this case, also not a good thing for the Tarran because it means he's, it could have been way richer Mules really do make you very, very rich very quickly A couple extra barracks on the way here Two-two as well This is a could drop I like this drop The control here is also pretty solid It does need to pick up right now It's not the greatest pickup that first one and the second one, the mutas come in So I'm not even going to complain about it Liberator, okay. So right now the plan should be to get drilling claws and probably get a Thor At the same time, getting a lot of minds He's seen the muralist at this point already and just isn't responding to it whatsoever Generally when there is a big flying threat heading towards your base, it is very wise to start building some turrets But as we have already decided, this man has the neural capacity of a jelly bean, it seems like So I'm not surprised that he doesn't really have any turrets ready This once again a good fight for the Terran, though Taryn actually is not doing too poor if you don't count the 4K resources in the Zerk bank. Taryn also is pretending like the only unit that is relevant in this game is the Marine This man builds the barracks, the first unit he can build in the game, the Marine, the first combat unit, and that's all he builds 60 Marines, nine MEDAX and five mines That's it Nothing else Not a high mine count, not a single marauder in here either only now as he finally starting to add a couple more mines Ooh This honestly, I think, was a really quick response time if he had responded before the banings would have killed all the SEVs Potentially, that could have been a really quick response time. But I don't want to blame him too much for missing that response time, even though there really was nothing going on Perhaps in his mind there was a lot going on Probably had a rough day Wait, why am I being so nice? I just like the guy Double stim It's kind of risky If you double stim, this can happen Like, all your units die immediately I know they always say, don't do drugs, not even once But really doing drugs once is okay Just don't do it twice, because that's when it really, you know, goes bad At least if you're a Marine If you're not a Marine, don't even do it once, guys There's no matter of X around. That's an orbital command on the fort base as well Generally makes life harder He's getting more reactors What? He looks at his current production, sees five barracks with a reactor One barracks with a Tech Lab I can only build 11 Marines at this point Let me just up that capacity to 15 Marines at a time. It's always to me that at this point you want to be transitioning into marauders, if only for the fact that you want to be capable of tanking bailings a little bit better, because so far tanking bailings has been a real issue right now he sees that there is ultralises well so that's what 13 minutes in or so sees that ultras are here marine production is continuing this reactor production is continuing as well marines actually do negative damage against the ultras look at that there's not even kite and a splating yet look how ridiculous is they actually don't do anything that's so crazy also hasn't built a worker in the past five minutes though Another big move Oh! T-da-da-ta-te-te-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-te This is the Mule-A-Larm. If you have triple orbital commands with full energy, 600 energy, you get the Mule alarm, and he got it Congratulations, my friend You got your own award It is the I forgot the Mew for literally 10 minutes in this game award Very big Not a lot of people have that one yet I'm very proud of it you Extremely proud even Oh, here comes the worker production back again Fifteen overlords from this guy Also big Also big Five corruptors So he just saw the fact that there's like 10 Ultralesk Continues Marine actually completely cuts his unit production This is not building anything anymore It gets plus one vehicle weapons. The thing I really need right now is vehicle weapon, so with the single siege tank that I can pump out at the same time, maybe we can take out these ultras This is movement It loses half of his Marines before they even get to shoot Loses another half of his Marines in his METAVac There's like five Marines left over This point there's more Ultralist and corruptors than there is Marines on the map Yet this drop is still doing damage Now, you could say at this point, the game is is over There's a craptone of ultras, but I don't actually think this game is necessarily over for three reasons Okay, one, this Zerk is really keen on going back home. Two, there's no creep spread And three, there's so many mules that if he mules at some point, his production is going to go absolutely bananas Like he's going to be so ridiculously high It really sucks so far that my man Profit over here hasn't really been controlling his army too well, even though he seems to focus on it very well He also hasn't been macroing too well, and he's floating 2K minerals without having muled, which also is better Okay, this is a good move Getting a tech lab here, I like that It's getting another tech lab in the main base He'll start tank production He's getting liberators as well Could maybe even get a bunker It's going to get a command center. Look at him He's actually transitioning into a sensible, position at this point Sure, it took him two minutes to start the preparations for the transition, but rather late than never, even though I'm afraid that if the Zerk still moves across the map at any point, the Zerk will just straight up win I think you can do in this case, by the way, if you don't have the army that you think you need to fight your opponent's army, is you can just either be very aggressive as Terran So you have like two Madov X on the left side, You have like two meta facts over here, and you're just keeping your opponent on their side of the map. Or with an entire army, see where your opponent's army is, and then just dodge it, and always base straight Leave mines sprawled all across the map, hope that he walks into it, keep some lips at home or something like that And just like that, you have a decent chance Oh, there goes the entire base That's a lot of energy on that thing Not that it matters, because I already know that it wouldn't have been used Mines, you could burrow them potentially could have burrowed these mines here That would have been really nice Once again, just picks up units in his meta-ax Actually kind of painful. I feel like if he wouldn't have tried to split here against the Ultras, but rather just kite and actually had all of his units on the ground than the mines burrowed, he could have won this fight I really do believe that In that case, the game isn't even that bad, is it? I mean, this orbital is still alive You have a fifth base He's actually, I think he's going to be hitting full energy on four command centers in a couple of seconds I don't think I've ever seen that before in my life I'm very excited for this moment Look at it It would really suck if he decides to mule now Well, it would not suck for him, but for me it would. I'm looking forward to the 200 energy Do you get it? No, my God Are you joking? Is this the timing you want to go? Did he use all of him just now? Oh, he still has the main base Oh, he's throwing it over here Look at his income Look at the income go Look at income home I'm not sure if he's going to get that time though This guy's going to start walking across him up Look at it Oh, 4 7 5K! 5K minerals That is so many marines he can build There's like a hundred marines a minute And I bet he would have come And I bet he would have gone for Marines Oh, he's getting ghost, actually. Nice spread of the mines all at the same spot Very smart That way, bainlings can all splash on top of them at the same time At this point, the game is pretty over, though The army is simply too small Not a lot of money in the bank It's an interesting game This genuinely was an interesting game because the Taryn got pretty far ahead in the early game And it's not common, I think, at the lower level for Taryn to lose in these later games because mines are just so good in these situations But here it happened I kind of want to go over his little imbalance complaint for him again. So although I don't have brilliant multitasking ability, I still manage the micro to plus one plus one upgrade I actually skipped over this gem the first time I read it Although I don't have a brilliant multitasking ability, I still manage the macro to plus one plus one upgrade Like this is something to be proud of Like, although I am no chef at a restaurant, I did manage to boil an egg this morning It's like, all right I'm not quite sure if these things are even slightly connected, but good job on starting one once Like one of the easiest thing is starting upgrades, especially the first two Because of my micro, I went very aggressive to vizurcon creep. I managed to get a good trade of it I'm not quite sure what trade he's talking about, but I don't think I've seen a single good trade, except the first time he moved across the map with these fuel tanks That was only a good trade initially because he just had way more units, not because of his micro It's just a straight-up lie And then the Ultralist game, and that's when everything went wrong Well, things actually already went wrong a little bit before the Ultralisc So, first of all, let's just divide this into a couple of parts So we're going to be defining this in your build order, your composition and your control Starting with your build order. Well, you went for a stim timing and forgot your stim That is not good usually The follow-up also wasn't very tight You're supposed to push with three MET-FX You were floating 1,200 minerals multiple times within the first five minutes It was chaos, okay? It was chaos in your head It was chaos on your opponent's side as well You kind of got out ahead, but your build order just wasn't good Your early game was bad It sucked It really did suck So for that, you're going to get a negative Your army composition And the way that you craft your army in TVZ is really quite simple I think TVZ, the theory there, is the easiest thing in the entire world. Because as you hit three bases, you go up to five barracks That is what you do Okay You go up to five barracks Four of these are reactors One of this is a tech lab That's a tech lab that researches the stim and the combat shield Before you build your fourth command center, you get your second factory, then you have one factory with a reactor on it and one factory with a tech lab You can get your drilling clause and you can get a lot of mines if you need to, or if you're playing against hydras, you can get tanks going as well and you can get tank and mine composition, that type of stuff. Then after your fourth base, you add three more barracks and there you get tech labs on all of these barracks That leaves you with four barracks with reactors and four barracks with attack collapse The reason you do this is because if your opponent has a lot of banlings, marauders are great at tanking banlings And on top of that, if they ever transition into either Lurker or into Ultralis, you already have a unit that does very well against armoured in the marauder And this is a step that you completely skipped All of your fights, first of all, there was too many, two little mines in your army in general in the early parts of the midgame. But also in the later fights, there was no marauders, not enough mines you were just lacking something to beat banlings And if you're a clam or any other top terran, you can probably micro very well against high bainling counts, but you can't I've seen you try to split and it just doesn't work That's okay if you can't split, but then don't attempt it and try to make it a little bit easier on yourself or do attempt it and still make it easier yourself by getting marauders and banings So for your army composition, you're going to get a negative there And on top of that, yeah, You just didn't have marauders ready for the Ultralist, which is genuinely quite bad. They like the Liberators being added on, but even that was a bit late Your ghosts also were late Just everything was late Everything was a reaction rather than an anticipation And often that is not how it should be in StarCraft So for that, you're also going to get a big thumbs down Then the final one, your micro Your micro, the entire game just wasn't very good I think I've seen you stutter step a couple of times, which was fine when you're stutter stepping into like a queen or something like that I mean, there's really nothing to micro there except just stutter stepping But the rest of it just wasn't pretty Your splits always sucked Your MEDAX were always floating behind. Your pickups weren't clean Your pickups weren't smooth You were consistently picking up units in your MEDAX while you were trying to micro back or kite In that final fight against the Ultras, rather than kiting the Ultras, you decided to pre-split your army against Ultralist that doesn't even make sense It really just doesn't because then the ultras just get to spread out and they do the maximum amount of damage while you're just standing still So yeah, that also just was really bad It sucked You put all these three together and you, my friend, you sucked It wasn't in balance The Ultralisk is not in balance There's good counters Terran has a lot of counters to them Liberator, mine, Marauder, Ghost. Mine, not so much, but Marauder, Liberator, Ghost Very good counters You just didn't use them or you used them too late And that's all on you You suck All right That's going to be it for today's episode of is it imba or do I suck if you didn't enjoy this episode Don't forget the like button, subscribe to the channel and hopefully I'll see you all next time for a new video Thank you so much for watching and bye-bye."

        "text": "Dear Harstam, please help So my drops killed 45 drones I was up in upgrades, killed the fourth Supply was 180 versus 120 around 12 minutes Lurkers simply walk and borrow so fast in great numbers and murders everything All resources I read slash watched about lurkers couldn't help and I simply feel like once they get to the field, the game is over A very short Iodis complaint form It is rare that we have one this short It's also, it is a complaint about lurkers, but it's also a cry for help out in the desert, a man who needs water And I have about a half a bottle left So we see if we can provide some to Victor. We're also going to judge, of course, if the lurker is indeed imbalanced or if it is him that is sucking We have a game on 2K atmospheres against a Zirk The only race that can build Lurkers Both players are opening with a pretty standard opener Hatch first for the Zerk player We see a your average barracks expand There's no second gas yet I'd be very surprised for this to be anything but a barracks expand Now this is a map on which Lurkers are fine They're not necessarily brilliant, but they're definitely fine on it Attacking with Lurkers can be a little bit tricky because it's a bit larger of a map And taking a sixth base for ZERC can be very hard as well. This base is kind of out there and often with Lurkers defending this area And this This area is very doable, but once you get this base, it'll become tricky, and there's so many areas you need to defend that, well, it's a bit of a pain in the bomb So we're going to see exactly what's going to go down this game I'm quite curious Lurkers do have, you know, they have a lot of potential Lurkers are quite good I know myself, I play a fair amount of Terran They're difficult to deal with And often, the best way to deal with lurkers is to realize that the best that the best way to deal with Lurkers is not Marine Marauder or Marine Widow Mine. And this sounds very obvious, but most Terrans, including myself, when I play Terran, you just kind of like to stick to Marine Marauder because you use that composition the entire game and then having to switch out seems like a bit of a hassle You're so used to pressing your Barracks Hotkey and then spamming the A and the D button, switching off to your factory, building a couple of mines, maybe half a siege tank or something like that It just feels nice and it feels right You're in control, you have momentum. And then all of a sudden there's this unit that doesn't really care about how many bio units you have, but he just cares about the fact that you don't have any other units than bio And in your head, you're like, well, I'm winning I should just be able to kill my opponent like Terran usually does You just kill your opponent if you're ahead But the Lurker is a little bit different and it can be quite frustrating for Taryn and I understand that But you have tools like the Liberator, the Ghost, siege tanks in large numbers All do very well, of course, given that you do have some type of detection And we'll see what Victor his mistakes are here. So opening up with a Liberator first I feel like these Helions are quite late to start My God sure wasn't wrong You know, these are the first two cars Well, I'm not quite sure what exactly has been happening here, but this built doesn't seem like the absolute tightest Opening up with a Liberator first, it's not super common anymore These days, almost everyone goes Viking into Liberator That way you can chase away the overlords that are going to be spotting your Liberator path if you want to be getting for two Starboard units, two Liberators, or one Liberator, one Viking, something like that, that tends to be the most common setup. We'll see if he gets maybe another Liberator behind this, or if this is going to be it Builds a couple of depots as well I do like it Build order isn't the tides, isn't the cleanest This is a diamond game and for a diamond game, this just looks like a very solid builder Honestly, 30C should go down right now Yep, okay Yeah, I'm really not complaining about this whatsoever Well, I'm complaining a little bit The fact that all of these Helions are at home and not on the other side of the map doing something is pissing me off a little bit Okay, and he's going to head into tanks from here on now So you see the tech lab on the factory. So the reactor being built with the star port One barracks will go down here and one barracks should be going down Yeah, somewhere over here Good It's a good setup It's very important for Terence to know how to build reactors and how to build tech labs This is one of the things that you just need to learn and Victor is aware of that He seems like someone that either watch us pro Starcraft, either actual tournaments or just watch his replays or build order guides because he's played, oh my God, there's not a nice fight I think Oh Yeah, this is not something I generally recommend is running from the left to the right on creep to achieve nothing. Whenever you move with Helions, you always kind of want to have a goal The goal here, it seems like, was to get from this side over here to this side over here and you have two options You have the path that is very dangerous and is on creep, and you have the path that is about as long and is not on creep, this path I would always go for the path without any danger It just doesn't make a lot of sense to go on the path where there's links Now he ends up losing what? A bunch of halions. He kills a few links, but I think losing links isn't actually that big of a deal as long as you don't have to reproduce them immediately And as the halion count has stopped growing I don't think there's any need for immediate links Game in general is looking pretty good for the Zerk as not a lot of Harris has been done I'm not sure if the Liberator just died or I didn't even see where it went but it probably Oh, it's seized up I think I did see that Seagued up in the main base or something Orbital Command is going to start landing towards the line third base Majority of the time you see this forward base. A couple of reasons you can put a siege tank up here and kind of keep it safe from that high ground Also gives you a nice position to start pushing towards this tower, which tends to be very important in the ZVT matchup, this tower because you can kind of easily deny this base, you have access to the creep here very easily So I would say normally this is a good position to push to Now that you're taking this base, you could technically push over here, but you leave yourself very open for run bys It's not a great path to push, I would say, majority of the time I'll think Victor is a little bit late with his meta-vex, I feel like. I'm not quite sure why, because he didn't actually open up with that many units I mean, he went for six Hellions and one Starport unit I believe your first Metafact, two Metafact push should be hitting at what? 620, 625, something like this Now it does have two tanks with this, which is going to help And he's kind of, it's like a distraction, I think I don't think this is a real Yeah, it's a distraction It tries to run away, the same time pushes in, Stimms, The Maddox aren't quite with this army yet, though It goes forward Sieges completely on creep Takes a couple of Spinecrofts. I mean, this is a good trait so far, but, right, like this is where the real problem kicks in Because he's either going to need to stimming a second time But then if the bailings come in, you're just going to absolutely get blasted Because two stims means that every single Marine is going to die to one bailing shot And even though Victor had way more units here, this fight didn't actually end up as great as it should have been I think he should have just straight up won the game here Now I'm not even sure if that's going to be possible Is there one-one for the Zirk? No, just plus one on Malay It's going to surround these tanks, get them down. Queen survive as well Yeah It's interesting games What is this? Oh, is that Barracks 4 and 5? There's a lot of money floating as well for both players That's, yeah, it's not great And the reason why I think it's usually worse for Terran to float money is because for Terran it's really easy to continuously be producing For Zurich, you need to do your injects, but for Terran, all you need to do is hit your Barracks Holtki and build some units So I always judge the Terran players a little bit harsher if they don't manage to macro during their push because it's just a little bit easier than with most other races because you don't have to look at your production. You can just do it at the same time So, a little bit sloppy floating that money there Dust immediately continue into 2-2, which is very important Sensor tower as part of the wall I'm not quite sure how brilliant that is Actually, I'm pretty sure that's not super brilliant, but it's going to work for now Painlinks are going to start rolling in as well And, well, actually, taking out a bunch of these memories I feel like Victor is playing a decent game. except for the fact that he's floating 2K minerals so far but everything he's doing just makes a fair amount of sense like I I really do feel like he's someone that understands this game he's quite good at the game even I would say the micro isn't completely clean the build orders aren't completely clean be the ideas behind most moves and the understanding of what needs to be done at what times yeah I actually think he's he's playing a good game here especially for a 4 2K Terran player I'm really curious why he isn't slightly higher up on the ladder Like, no, he's, you know, macro isn't perfect. 49 SCVs, I think he just lost a bunch, so I'm not going to complain about that either Now, I do have to admit, sometimes when people say this guy has good macro, what they really mean is that a person is good at producing SUVs And I feel like that might actually be the case here for Victor I think Victor is good at producing SUVs and getting a lot of money That means he's almost constantly up in supply But he also is floating a lot of money So his actual spending of the money isn't great, but he's good at getting it And these are two really different skills. StarCraft kind of is a game in which you have like a lot of different skills, even within the bigger categories of skills So people often go like, oh, his micro is really bad But it's almost never as black and white as someone's micro being bad overall, but being bad in certain situations You have people that are good at splitting against banlings, but can't target fire a bainling if it were, you know, if it were going to save their lives And it's the same with macro There are people that are really good at producing SUVs and really good at keeping like a tight build order in the first five minutes But then one thing start happening, they just can't spend their money. And I feel like that's kind of happening here So his actual openers, the idea, behind the macro are good The continuous SUV production or the almost continuous SUV production, just getting the big eco has been good But the actual spending has been very mediocre At times, he probably could have had 20, 30 more units with a lot of the pushes That's kind of painful Once again, going for good moves Sending out a double drop, dropping them outside of creep I hope he actually is going to do that Not boost into the main base Okay, I'm not a huge fan of this. This is the type of multitasking, which is really good if you're very, very fast, but if you're not very, very fast, it's not that brilliant It's going to lose one METAVAC here It's going to try to migrate This is a good pickup It's going to immediately go into the natural as well, I think That is pretty cool And this base gets cleaned up at the same time So it's just doing large, large amounts of damage right now Gets a drop in here another pickup as well So honestly I'm not too disappointed Wow It's actually playing a good game I really am pretty impressed here There's two mines here Mines take some, do some damage MetaVac picks up as well. This has just been very good Units lost so far, pretty far in favor of the Taryn Taryn's also up in workers Right now would be a good time to probably start transitioning, to, well, you have a second factory already Actually, do you need to transition at this point? I don't think so I think you can just continue pushing on Whenever you do some big damage, you can often continue pushing on and do even more damage That's exactly what he's doing A lot of it is focused kind of on these tropes, and I wouldn't mind one big push, you know? Like, it's really fun to deal small amounts of damage, but you're still just, well, it's not small amounts. You're doing big amounts of damage, but at some point you still need to knock him out You know, you're hitting all your punches, you're landing a lot of punches, and you can see the guy is kind of stumbling in the ring, and you just kind of keep, like, just small jabs all the time And that is completely fine That's a way to win But at this point, he's so ready to get knocked out Perhaps it's just time to, you know, deal the final blow And there's another reason for this is that often when you're playing against Zirk, or also against Tos as a Taryn, Tos and Zirk have these units that kind of give large power spikes. So the way that TVZ works is that it kind of flows Sometimes Taryn is up in map control in a way, and that's in the midgame phase, when they have these marines, these mines, and a bunch of marauders on the map as well It's very easy for them to have map control, and they're the one pushing out But then once the lurker is out, that is a very scary moment for the Terran And you kind of want to make sure that you delay that moment as much as possible and also that you're aware of that moment Because the moment your opponent gets lurkers, you want to be capable of keeping your opponent at home. If your opponent is not staying at home with the lurkers, it means they're on your side of the map And most of the time, Terran isn't set up with it It's the same against Prolos Once a lot of Colossi get out, like three or four Colossi, Taryn can't really fight that army immediately, but that is completely fine because you always have the option to base rate, because you have map control up until that point, and it's impossible to catch your army Same with Lurkers Lurkers can't catch up with your army It's not possible So this is a concept that is difficult for Terrance to understand often, but being aggressive, majority of the time, is actually good, is the best defensive option. There's a couple of cents an hour, and he actually is going to go for that aggression that does see that there's something happening here here come the lurkers they burrow so you see job you scan interesting fight let's look at that one again I think though I think I know where the issue might be Victor so we had one fly against 126 So he sees the army move in They burrow, slow burrows still Is there scans available? There's none over here There's none over here And there's none over here No scan available Okay So that immediately tells me that he should not be engaging this fight because he can't see the unit This is just pretty basic He walks forward Doesn't stim yet. Doesn't stim yet Now he stims Loses half of his army to the next shot, moves back into the lurkers, and then as his entire army dies, his scan becomes available, he scans, and then the tanks actually do reasonably well against these lurkers and actually push them away So what wasn't possible with 180 supply here, he managed to do with four tanks and a bunch of mines Pretty cool Now you might be wondering Kevin, he didn't have a scan What was he supposed to do? Well, a good trick against lurkers is A, they don't have recall B, they can't be in two plays at the same time. So if you have a defensive setup with tanks and mines, which lurkers can push into, the rest of your army can just go across the map and try the base rate That is a completely viable thing to do, especially if you're as far ahead as right now Let's take a look at the defenses that are on the side of the map of citizen Right here, there's about 17 creep tumors Now, creep tumors don't have any defensive properties They just provide vision Then there's 16 drones on minerals, two drones in this geyser, one drone in this geyser Not the best fighting unit either, the drone. There is five queens, no, sorry, six queens on the right side of the map with a bunch of transfuses, already upgrades, plus one attack and no carapace upgrades Now, I know that people say that the queen is overpowered, but if you have about 90 supply of bio against six queens, I do believe that you're going to be capable of winning What I'm trying to say is that there was nothing at home The home base was completely empty And it wouldn't even have been a base trade You could say, well, getting into a base trade would be a scary situation But it wouldn't have been a base because this base would have taken years to fall with the tanks and the mines over there. Moving forward was very dangerous I actually think that SCVs would have to run back home and he would come home to no home base So he would come home and then at that point the house is already destroyed, which is not quite what you want A bunch of Widow Mines are on the same location So, yeah, it was not a good decision to lose your entire army for free But the game isn't over yet You still have a lot of money in the bank You're up in income You have decent enough tanks You're getting another Factory, which I like It means it's going to be the third Factory You're actually taking out every single Lurker This is perfect. This actually was really not that bad Oh, this Lingman, nice painful Let me kill out three, four tanks Well, you also kill all of these links That's pretty cool Yeah, you're still far ahead You're so far ahead This game actually is over for the Zerk The Zerk is dead He's still there He's down 40-50 supply You're going to start building command centers I wouldn't mind if you add a couple of liberators at this point or even go for a Ghost Academy You're saying, hey, I want some extra attack I do like the high tank count, but I also really do like adding some type of secondary unit, either the lip or the ghost or both in this case. Okay, you have all minds together as well, Victor, and you should see mines Mines are a little bit like money, okay? And right now, what you're doing with your money, you're putting all of it in a savings account with negative interest You're putting them all together This is useless What I would recommend you do with these mines is that you spread them around the map So you put one over here, put one over here, one over here, one over here, one over here, it doesn't matter, just anywhere across the map. And if you do that, they'll start working more like an index fund in that you just put them there, you put your money there, or you put your minds there, you completely forget about them, and then they'll still give you profit Because the ZERC will always send units in different directions, and if they don't send them there, at least you know that that area is secure and nothing is happening on that side One of the things against lurkers that is often difficult to deal with is the lurker run by sort of surprise attacks when you're not in position So having them all over here is just a savings account with negative interest and we're going for that index fund type of fight. This is not investment advice, by the way This is a StarCraft 2 show, please, for the love of God 16 Marauders Okay, this is kind of what I was afraid of is that you continue Marauder marine production and once you spotted the lurkers A secondary tech, it isn't necessary in this position, but it's useful Good Lord! I actually think if you would have scanned and split your army, you would have won that Out of range Yeah There's like a dotted line here where you can see that this was going to be out of range It's impressive Now imagine there was a mine here and then a mine here Puff! All these units just dying This is a good move, by the way. This is exactly what you want to do If you don't have the tech yet, whether that's your ghost, your liberators, or your tanks, what you just do, you actually just go, this is this base trade type of move This is brilliant See the lurkers coming here? You're out of position Once again, imagine a mine here, man Free profits But yeah, this is very good because there's nothing at home So you can just kill everything right now You could go for the extractors, or you could kill the larvae as well Yeah, nice Take those larva out Yeah Take that Ooh Big stuff At the same time, you are getting kind of blasted at home But that's okay because you No. You can kill everything over here There's nothing defending These bases are empty It prefers to go for the creep Interesting decision That's a That is a very interesting decision here So you had this high-value target, the bases, the last mining basis of the Zerk You decided to go for a couple of creepsumers that were covering for a base that already was taken out Like this is not an area you even want to push in anymore You rotate three seconds after Okay, you're still in an okay spot Okay, you're light years ahead You have more bases than your opponent You have more income than your opponent You have an interesting stim You have more army than your opponent and so on. I like your upgrades too There's no carapace upgrades whatsoever for the Zerk Okay, so you see this in the censor tower? I like that you just keep going, though That was a very good call Okay, here come the Lurkers Here come the Lurkers No, no, no, no Just keep going, keep going Not enough MataVX either, though Which is kind of an issue But honestly, I think you just triple stimp the couple of marauders there Not enough Mettifx, but still, You take out a base I mean, there's not that much mining here left for the Zirk Yeah, sniper one or two of these lurkers Two of these lurkers go down Honestly, if you If you Yeah I mean, it's playable still. Can kill these lurkers, I think If you turn around, you shoot one, shoot one, shoot one And now run again Losing these meta-fax is kind of painful This makes it really difficult for you to To go for more base trading moves because you're running out But once again, like, these lurkers and hydras are going to have have a tough time killing this planetary If you can just lift this orbital command, you still have a base over here which is also a planetary Ah, this isn't quite necessary, but you're going to get two, three lurkers You have a lot of money in the bank still You could repair the planetary as well to make it survive longer. It's one of these advanced tricks is the repair I'm not quite sure people know about it in diamond Yeah, good Exactly This base is really secure at this point Look at this Beautiful stuff Yeah Once again you survive You're not quite up in income anymore because this base is mine, well, it's pretty close at least We're really just lacking that secondary attack, even just like two, three liberators here would be absolutely huge For now we don't even have a single meta-vex, so air units are kind of out of fashion, I feel like Oh, this is a classic move as well. This is the, wait, this is the second sensor tower? This is the sensor tower that reveals a base that the Zerk wasn't aware about Oh no, he did know about it Surprised he didn't attack it earlier I really am surprised Seven more lurkers Burrow being researched I love it Second, more tanks as well Six things What's this orator doing? What you doing, buddy? Okay, this is a free scan If you scan this and you just run in, you win Is there no scan available? Oh, no, he's no scan available It's going to get a scan in about four seconds And now these lurkers come in Lurkres? What? Was this a type kill? Lurkres are so ridiculous Look at this Ah ha ha. What? My man was 133 supply against 111 And as he sees the next Lurkres, As he sees the next Lurker's approach, he decides, and rather than focusing on the game and spending his money, he's gonna type the moment his opponent's lurkers run in Did he have a scan available? Yeah, the scan available If he pre-splits, I'm not saying he's gonna win the fight, but you could at least save his units, just move him back and let the tanks do the work This game wasn't over And now he's going to go in He lost half his army while he was typing, complaining about lurkers Oftentimes, the biggest enemy is our own mind No way You can be real. Well, let me read your complaint again Please help My drops killed 45 drones I was up in upgrades, killed the Ford Supply was 120 versus 180, and Lurker simply Walk and Burroughsafest in great numbers and murders everything So a couple of things here Early game, mid-game was all completely fine There were some minor issues with it, but you played it in such a way that you got a great position for yourself, where you had map control You were lacking vision at times, so you didn't really know what was happening around the map Things like run-bys could really kill you That's kind of what happened He did a Lurker run-by it really all goes wrong once the lurker comes out. And I think this is more a mental problem than anything else You just seem kind of tilted against it I mean, that first fight, I think you legit lost 90 supply, just walking back and forth in lurker shots while you didn't have detection Like, that has nothing to do with the lurker If you stood in 12 DTs without detection, you also would have lost or if there's the 12 or 13 ghost and the Zerk just stands around there for 25 seconds, yeah, he's also going to lose all of it Lurker should just kind of speed up the process because they have a lot of damage output and they do very well against clumped-up units. But you were aware what was happening and just decided to fight it You really need to see the lurker differently You can't see it as a unit that cares too much about how much supply there is You need to have the correct units to counter it, or you can just base rate and you just have been making the wrong decision So for your early and your midgame, I'd give you a big thumbs up I'd say, hey, buddy, good job But when it comes to your unit composition, not a single time did I see any improvement You're just sticking with your tank, mine, marauder, marine, which is fine if you use it correctly, but you also don't use it correctly. You don't use it to base rate You don't split You clump everything up You almost play against lurkers like they're banings Like you're kind of clumping up You're moving in and then you move out and try to split and then you go again But lurkers are static so that doesn't work They're not chasing you You need to go in in a big concave in order to fight them properly You didn't do that a single time, which is not good Yeah, the majority of your movement just isn't perfect Your map vision is kind of poor The way you use your minds isn't correct And once again, the lack of extra command centers also really hurt you here You just need extra scans. Get extra command center After you get your fifth top, after you get your fourth top, the moment you see your lurkers, you start adding command centers, morph them into orbital commands It's fine If you don't want to go into Liberator Ghost, because you don't understand how to use these units, another thing you can do, you can just kind of put siege tanks on the outside basis and use your Marine Marauder kind of as like a base trade unit So whenever you see the Lurkers move in somewhere or move somewhere, just go to a different position with your Marine Marauder, either forcing the Lurkers back or forcing the Lurkers to attack. into a massive tank position with a planetary, these traits are almost always going to be good for Taryn because there's just not enough, especially in a game like this where your opponent is on what, like 59 workers? Not good So once again, I want to say I really empathize with you, Victor I understand that the lurker is a tricky unit because you can't just build a composition that you build every single game for the past 10,000 games You actually need to change something And I know change is scary and change is difficult But there's also necessary for you to win this game, to win against lurkers in the future My friend, the lurker is not imbalanced You just really suck against it. That's a matter of fact All right That's going to be it for this episode of Is It Inba or Do I Suck?

        "text": "Dear Harstam, ZVP is the most stupidest matchup in the entire game, and every time I play it, I lose several brain cells The most stupidest matchup It's either the most stupid matchup or the stupidest matchup This sentence is the most stupidest in this entire imbalance complaint form doesn't work It's just the stupidest sentence Anyway, let's continue Here is a fun fact to entertain your StarCraft bodies Did you know that Voidreys counter hydras, question mark? They are faster than hydras, tankier than hydras, they can thicken beam to do more damage, they fly around terrain like Muralisks, and their voice is deeper and manlier than mine. I'm not quite sure what the last part has to do with the Hydra Lysk and the Voidre, but apparently these guys are a little bit insecure about his voice As it turns out, Voidres can also act like Muralis, except they're better, because instead of killing workers, they can kill entire hatcheries in one go It's so stupid that the attack I make of three base can't kill a four base protos because the void race can just kill all my hydras And then afterwards he has enough void race left to dance around the whole map like his protos beyond with 200 less APM I was so frustrated at the end that I left without Gigi. What do you think? Is it RIMBA? Or do I suck? Name the cell race Zerk, leak diamond 3,300 MMR and the server It's North America All right, let's have a look at this, Mr DeCell Your opponent is called Fat B-O in a box, so a fat build order in-box or a fat build-order in a box rather than in-box We're going to have a look to see whether that, first of all, there's a couple of claims in here, right? So the first major claim that our good friend, the cell makes over here, is the fact that the void ray is better than the hydra, that they counter the hydras This is the first claim that I kind of want to say is not true. Generally, pure void race do not beat hydras, unless you match them up one versus one But that would be a weird thing to do because the hydra is too less supply and is a whole lot cheaper Like that's kind of how most units work Like you can also complain in that case that the Ultralisk beats the salad It's like, well, yeah, like the Ultralisk is better One ultralisk also beats an immortal, but an immortal is still the counter to an ultralis I'm not actually sure if an ultra does beat an immortal now that I think about it And also, it's kind of weird because Zirk probably has the best anti-voydray unit in the entire game in the queen. This is a 150 mineral unit that costs two supply, which can be built of hatchery tech and a spawning pool So it's easily reachable for Zerk, and it absolutely hard counters pure void ray armies It starts getting a little bit worse once disruptors or storms are out, but against pure void ray, the queen is absolutely the best unit in the game It is super cheap It is very supply efficient If you have four queens and each queen has one transfuse and you fight against four void rays with plus one, the queen still end up winning While you have the supply, I doubt you'll lose more than two queens Maybe if there's plus one on the void rays, you'll those two queens. But they also scale better into a late game because the more transfuses you get, the better they become This is why at the highest level, we don't actually see a lot of void rays being built We see void ray openers going into carriers and into disruptors and into Archons But the amount of void rays that people build is actually very low The standard build order right now that most Koreans are using and that most the top players are using, it's a four void ray into double or into triple Stargate build Four void rays That's a maximum because Protoss players at the high level realize if you build more than four void rays, you're just going to die against any semi-average queen walk. And that is not quite what you want So yeah, I don't think the void ray is actually better than the HydroLisk And if you would ask me how to counter HydroLisk with Protos, the void ray would probably one of the last units I would mention I'd say Zellets I'd say disruptors Storm Do pretty well Colossi do pretty well I think we've pretty much had it at that point Yeah, yeah, I actually think that's pretty much it Centries are good in cutting them in half, the armies in half Maybe you can do something there, but in general, the void rate isn't actually that great. So we see an interesting build order here out of the Tossies opening up with a straight stargate, skips warpgate altogether, goes straight into plus one air, Zirk player opens up with a three hatch and the Zirk players of course the one we're really paying attention to gets a creep tumor out and goes for the third base in a line usually on Burlingrad you take the forward base because it allows you to start putting creep towards the middle faster it makes it easier that if you are playing against the Stargate built you can walk a couple of queens across the map generally quite helpful it also allows you to start spreading creep easier to this area which gives you vision of these edges makes it easier to counter like Voidre's flying into bases as well because you're still going to need to take this as your fourth base. You might actually struggle holding this base when the Protos player starts popping with Voidreys over here, in between the fourth and the main base This is a really quick layer, by the way This is a really quick layer It's going to cost him well at least a couple of drones Actually, down five drones at this point, I think just because for whatever reason he decided to not get any to not really use any of his larva here A little bit surprised by that Double gas for the TOS After the third base, this TOS builder, by the way, is really greedy He played this off of double adapt and he got the battery up. If there was any amount of links being sent across the map, I'm pretty sure that this could have been a cancel or at least a deny on the worker for a little bit The cell is aware of what's happening here So that is something Speed also finishes like a minute too late Interesting What is this spore protecting? Hello? What is this? He's really keen on holding the extractor If there was a single Oracle here, which luckily there isn't, this would be a terrible spore that isn't defending anything of value yet Like, if you want to defend this extractor, you can just put it over here as well Like, this is just defending less, it feels like This is like an anti. I'm not even sure what this spore defense I actually have no clue Sometimes you see anti-liberator spores that are being played in really odd locations You'd see like over here or something But void rays aren't spores So two voids are going to take out an overlord And that's allowed I think he lost one overlord at this point Yeah, that's usually the amount of overlords, one or two overlords And then you pull all your overlords back and you'll be fine He's taking a fourth base This is a three-based toss I'll have to read this thing again It's so stupid that the attack I make off of three bases can't kill a four-base pro-tos because the Void Race can just kill all my Hydras. Maybe he can't count? Maybe he doesn't understand what Zirg and Protos means He's on four bases already and this Protos is on three I might be missing something, but This is actually going to be impossible to do a three-based push at this point Fleet Beacon goes gone for the toss I also like that he rushed out a layer to then just not tack anywhere Look at this This is absolutely beautiful Rushing out a layer and then just keeping it idle for a minute This is the type of resource investment you want in your life It's super brilliant It's like buying a car for your kid when your kid is 10 It's like, we'll just keep it around for when you turn 18. It's like, why wouldn't just buy a car when your kid is 18? Now the car will just be sitting there in the garage for a kid eight years That's kind of what this layer is doing, right? It's just sitting there, it's losing value That money that was used in the layer could have been used for faster drones For whatever reason, this Zerg, without having built any units, is consistently, well, I know why he's down in freaking workers, he's loading 1,500 minerals and has 21 larva How is this even possible? This is the one thing that always surprises me when Zerks do this When they inject, but then they don't span the larva The Injecting is actually the hard part of Zerk. Like, if Zirks complain about finding it difficult to inject, they say, yes, that is actually quite difficult It's like an extra macro mechanic But then once you have these larva, all you need to do is have all your hatcheries in one hotkey Press the S button to select all larvae And then you can build like 40 drones at the same time Like that part of the macro is extremely easy and a lot easier than what Protos or Terran needs to do It goes into links Interesting call here Very interesting So far all he has seen is pure void race and his response is to pump out 19 links Get six extra overlords as well Double Evo at the same time. No vision whatsoever here on the top side, of course Often if you're playing against large void rate numbers, the only thing you really need to know is where the void race are So you can put one ling here, one link here And then you just have your queens either somewhere in the middle or you can split in two groups, like a group somewhere over here and like a group maybe somewhere over here So it's easy for you to rotate either into the main base towards your fourth or towards your third If you see the void race over here, one group of queens can go into your main and another group of queens can go into your fort base. That is kind of the plan There's 14 queens, which means that seven queens could be on each side But rather than splitting these queens in a way that would actually be smart, there is now six queens here on the bottom side trying to prey that the void rays are going over there Then the Voidreys pop into the main base, kill what, two, three queens, and kill one or two overlords as well I love the overlord rally into this, that's really cool So three queens, seven overlords have gone down, and he moved away with all of the queens as well from the fourth base So now he's also going to lose the fourth base. And now all of a sudden I understand how he's going to be doing a three base all in into a four base toss Now, personally, I find this a little bit disgenuine Usually when people say I did a three-base all-in, what they mean is they did an all-in that was optimized around three bases Okay? Because you can't afford the fourth base because your all-in is so optimized or your push is so optimized that spending these extra 300 minerals and that drone is just going to be too much and it will cut into your unit count That's not the case here, however. What happened here is that this guy wanted to play a macro game, his fourth base got taken out because he doesn't understand understand how to split queens, and then he's going to attack with a mainly Ling army There's a bunch of queens This actually could still work, or this probably should still work Like, Void race trades so insanely poor against queens that if our Zirk player actually manages to move across the map, I think he's still going to win What is this Tos doing, by the way? He's playing six Stargate, yeah, six Stargate, with Flux Vains, pure Void Ray This actually just gets countered by Queens and also by Hydras Sixteen balings You might say, man, what a stupid call to build balings. There's only air, but I actually like the bailings here because they will help clearing up these cannons Sadly, he wasn't aware that the Voidreys kind of went around And as a result, actually, it's going to turn into a two base alien now Man, if I was him, this imbalance complaint form would have looked very different I was two base alinning my opponent I still couldn't kill him while I was on 4 base There's actually a good amount of hydras as well Okay, so decides to right click Did you just move command? Both of them are kind of move commanding So this fight, this initial fight here went well Okay, so you clear these cannons Well, the mainlings don't really connect with the cannons. The hydras do all the hard work, but in the end you get some damage in That's all good Then you can see that there's a lot of void race coming And at home, you still have 11 queens You also have 19 hydras with plus one What you could decide is to kind of kite back with the hydras against these void race to try and go to your queens Because if you reach the queens, your hydras stay alive, then you can start pushing on the map with these queens If your queens ever make it to the other side of the map, you win the game There's nothing here that can kill a queen You have plus one queens. You have what? How many transfuses? This is too many to count I have two hands and two feet, and I would not be capable of counting the amount of transfuses on my hand and my feet with the amount of queens that you have 11 queens, it is too many Too many On top of that, you decide to right-click this hatchery with all your hydras Please note that you did like 400 or 500 damage before you decided to start attacking Voidrays Void rays have 250. health total shields plus HP, which means that rather than doing the 500 damage on the Nexus, if you would have immediately started attacking the void race, you would have been capable of clearing about two more void race for free Then you would have had 10 hydras against 8 void rays, and because of the snowball effect, maybe you would have lost less hydras Now, you just seen that your opponent has still 10 void race, and you have 10 hydras You could just walk your queens across the map Or you could try and bust into your opponent's natural while you already know that your opponent has as many void rays as you have hydras. Thought of that this one hydra, like literally 20% of your hydra force was not even in the fight Now 20% sounds like a lot, but in reality it was just two hydras One hydra moving into the natural and then one hydra over here But this is a queen hydra bane push First of all, it hit way too late. like this is supposed to hit at like 720 or so you had at like 840 with way less units and also you hit without queens hitting a queen walk without queens is a little bit like making a hot chocolate without using chocolate it's just a glass of milk and although milk is quite good by itself if you were expecting a hot chocolate you're not going to be happy and if you're wanting to do a queen hydrabane walk and you forget the queens that is a very significant part of that push That is not with the push So now you're going to start spreading some creep Still haven't rebuilt this base either. You've been long distance mining from your third base, while your fourth base or your old fort base is already done So rather than increasing your income very easily by clicking your 16 workers over here, you decide to actually stay at an equal income to your opponent Now you get the queens out I like that This is a good call And this is still a fight that I think you can can just win The only thing you need to take care of right now is the cannons And if you kill the cannons with like a couple of bailings, I actually think you should win, no? 14 void rays against 17 hydras and 15 queens That's a 100% win for you. Sure, you only have, how many is this, nine queens with this army, which is not the largest amount of queens But it still should be fine This is like, kind of like if you would serve someone a hot chocolate, but you would just give them a glass of hot milk first, and then after they finish the milk, you give them a piece of chocolate Not even at the same time, just at separate occasion This makes absolutely no sense They were here They just stood there as all your hydrolyst died Queens are supposed to tank If your queens can't tank, at least they can transfuse and deal the damage themselves as well This is actually ridiculous. You end up killing almost nothing, and now the queen show up, and the funny thing is that this fight isn't easily winnable for your opponent Just the queens by themselves are actually an issue Imagine if you still had 15 hydras here with this, you would have been able to actually kill these things Look at this You have so many, he can't just engage into this Well, he can try, but he probably is going to lose like four or five void rays before he even gets rid of half of the transfuses Granted that you do use the transfuses, which, yep, I was kind of doubtful of Look, imagine you had like 14 hydras shooting here. Without losing a single queen, you could have killed probably five or six void rays, and then he just needs to walk away, because you have 15 hydars and 50 queens still shooting him And now you've lost the game You're down and out You're down, what, 60 supply? You discussed the APM So this guy has 150 1 apn and you have 1 74 How is that down 200 apm? Maybe you meant 20? You just put a 0 too many That is possible I do like this Right-clicking the hatchery Like obviously you can right-click a hatchery if there's nothing there Like every race can do that. If you had 35 hydras and your opponent had one cannon over here, the hydras are really good at clicking main bases as well I do agree that Voidrace are quick at killing hatchery but I mean are they allowed to beat something? They die against the two supply 150 mineral unit majority of the time Like are they allowed to have one specialty? And if the specialty is right-clicking hatcheries when there's no one around, then I think that is a fair trade for a unit that costs 250 minerals and 150 gas It's freaking infinite supply But yeah, I think that is actually fair Once again, you get tricked by this little poke into the main base, then into the fort Look at that. Nice split here There's an even split as well All the hydras into the fourth base Ah, and he goes into the main again And ping pong must be a very difficult game for you to play You don't understand how these void race ping pong from the fourth into the main And following the ball is going to be a real challenge for you as well I can only imagine At this point, you're dead And him playing like, what did you call this? Let me pass the game here afterwards he has enough void race left to dance around the whole map like he's a protos beyond with 200 less APM. Yeah, well, what else is he supposed to do? He can't straight up and gauge into you. Even though he's up 30 supply This is how good Hydras are. Even though you got completely blasted in the fight and your opponent is up 30 freaking supply, he's too afraid to attack into you. So rather than attacking into you, he's using the fact that not once in your life, have you had a single unit on the map trying to spot where his Void Rays are coming from and every single time you find yourself on the wrong side of the map when the Void Rays show up. You see the void rays leave over here into the dead space and you're like, I'll probably come back here because he saw my Hyras here Surely he wants to come back to this area This ProDos, honestly not even the most brilliant strategic move, every single time he moves away with the void race from a location and he sees your units there, he flies to the other side And after this happening for five times, you still haven't been able to figure out the trick You're the magician's dream They could just do the same car trick 15 times in a row, and you'd be absolutely surprised You're the ultimate mark. Like, if someone's playing three-card Monty and you show up, they can buy a house after you're done It's actually insane How bad you are at reading this guy's mind Well, you don't even need to be a mind reader Like, this is just logical reasoning He pops out here and he shows up on the other side 10 times What do you think he's going to do the 11th time? Yeah, the exact same trick How does this work? How do you not realize that if he's over here and you move your entire army over here, look this, that he's going to move back and try to clear that bottom base? Why would you not just split this army? And now you go again. All 30 hydras There's like a dog dog chasing a ball Except sometimes when you do the fake throw, like, my girlfriend has a dog If I do the fake throw, the dog is smart enough to realize that it's a fake throw But you're the kind of guy that just starts running and starts looking for the ball It's like, it's absolutely insane You're the dream to play against as a Voidre player Meanwhile, this guy is macroing up at home He's doing a fantastic job Getting more carriers You're getting your carapace upgrades going And I do like Carapace upgrades, nothing wrong with that Somehow during all of this, you still manage to float 1,400 gas God knows how, but you're achieving it. Now you go for the counterattack, and yeah, now there's freaking five carriers out with plus two You lose the game, you forget the Gigi Like, I don't actually understand what you want me to say here Did you even watch this replay? Sometimes I really feel like that people don't watch them before they send them in They just make something up You can't actually, unironically, be sending me a form saying that it's so stupid that the attack I make off of three base can't kill a four base protos. Like, does he think that I'm not going to watch the replay? Does he think I'm just going to look at this imbalance complaint for him? After two years of doing I owe this, after having like a hundred freaking episodes of this show, does he think that this time I'm just not going to watch the replay and believe him on a survey? Like, ah, yeah, makes a lot of sense Three base versus four base does sound like the high rest of weekend Avoid race to imbalance You know what? Inbalance, pack it up, hamster We go home Thanks everyone for watching No, of course not Like, you lost the base Your timing was delayed by a minute and a half It hit without queens. And the hydras, whenever they were in sufficient numbers, probably would have traded well if the Protos ever had wanted to trade with you However, this Protos sees pure hydras And it's like, well, I don't actually want to fight that Let me trick this guy ten times in a row Like, we can kind of, we can put this in in two parts, okay? Part number one is your strategy, strategy choice, strategy execution Your strategy choice was actually fine I think Hydra Bain into Queen is a fine strategy against six Stargate Voidre, which is, in my opinion, not very good I think Voidreys are a bad unit generally They're good for staying alive in the early game, denying vision and keeping your third base alive. But that's really it, at least in PVZ, There is some niche aliens that might be okay However, your execution is so bad You hit without any queens You attack the wrong things at every single time Your attack prioritization is literally off every single fight that I see you fight So for the strategy part, you're not going to get a sufficient grade Let me put it like that If this was a year in school, you would have to redo the year Or you would be kicked back a year and I'd have to question the teacher a year before, how in the world it's possible that you managed to even, you know, pass grade three Because honestly, the execution was very miserable It's awful. It made me sad If Lombo would watch this, he could possibly get a depression So I'll recommend him to not watch this episode I know he's a big fan of the show, though Shout to Lombo Secondly, is your brain and your intelligence Now, usually I'm not a man that goes after someone's IQ or goes for ad hominem attacks But you are just extremely slow in the head And I don't mean that as an insult. I'm explaining this to you so you understand that in the future, you can kind of adapt to this, okay? If you're very slow in the head and you're slow to kind of adapt to problems, what you can do is before the game is think about problems that could occur So, for example, if a problem would be that, he ping-pongs in between my main base and my fort base 20 times, a solution to that problem could be to split your army in two. Now, I understand that this takes a lot of time, and then you have useful resources like the Battlenet forums or any Discord which has a lot of Terrans in it, which are always very friendly when it comes to giving advice to the other races These are the types of places where you could get advice if the problem is too hard for you to find a proper solution to And I think rather than seeing this at a disadvantage that your brain isn't fast and you're not very smart, use it as an advantage and be very well prepared And rather than saying, I am stupid, say, I am well prepared for a lot of situations that could occur. But for now, your brain is god-awful, so you also get a negative grade for that Put these two bad boys together And sadly, my friend, The void ray is not imbalanced You just suck That's the way of the world Sorry All right That's going to be it for this episode of Is It Inba? Or do I suck?

        "text": "Hello, Hirsten To be honest, I realized that I was floating way too much minerals And to be frank, I'm not on the level I used to be It is too many minerals Whenever you have something that is countable, it is many And whenever something that isn't countable, it is much You have too much water, but you have too many minerals Anyway, let's go on However, even so, I feel like the attention needed to deal with lurkers in the midgame seems to be too much compared to how much effort the Zerk has to do to actually do insane damage After watching the replay, I noticed I could probably have done a better base rate instead of trying to defend my third. But even so, I decided to ask you if you deemed this imba or not Finally, I should probably have transitioned to disruptors earlier The last comment feels a bit like a throwaway comment It's like he already has the conclusion and then he puts like a part of the middle of the body of the text there at the end It doesn't make a lot of sense If there's one piece of advice I can give you before we get into this replay, is that please never become a professional writer Because when it comes to the buildup of a text, you don't really seem to understand too much And the grammar definitely also could use some work. Oh, before I forget, of course, we're dealing with a Protos player who is a master on the European server and his 4 5K MMR All right Let's have a look at this See what our man's spotlight here has to, has done wrong or what he has done correct, of course It's completely possible that the lurker actually is imbalanced because that really is what his complaint is about The lurker simply being too strong It's very common that we, we, and I say we, I mean I, that I get complaints about the lurker in my inbox People are always like, the lurker is way too good, it's invisible, it does splash damage, it's invisible, I can't see it. It is difficult to attack it without detection And if you notice something, it's that a lot of these complaints are the same thing It's about the fact that you can't see them And often, just having detection kind of is the answer to all of their issues, just not realizing that they can get more than a single observer or more than triple orbital commands for scans They can get 10 orbital commands for scans, and then all of a sudden, it's a lot easier Anyway, I'm drifting off here It's going to have a, to take a look here at the build order Standard 20 Nexus Not mining quite enough gas, but this is a, this is a, this is a master's game game, low masters. I'm kind of okay with it You know, the build order doesn't have to be super precise As long as you're doing the main thing's correct, which is the timings of the buildings and when to pull the workers in and out of gas It's kind of secondary You know, and so far, it looks pretty okay He's even doing a little bit of mineral harass here, which I do like You see the APM, 173, 172 for a 4 5 player, that's pretty darn decent Circus is pretty low, by the way, which is rare to see It is what it is Second piling goes up as well We get the chrono boost on the adept. This is an actual build order and he's doing it in kind of a tight way The only real mistake I've been able to spot so far is the fact that he didn't get a block on his opponent's natural So he probably did a gateway scout and the fact that he was a little bit too late into his own gas Once again, these are things that I can forgive Scouted all three bases as well So knows exactly what's going on so far in this game First, ADEP is not moving across the map I like to just send that first ADAPT across the map, especially if you're Krono with, to just get a little bit of information. If you don't want to send your ADAPE across the map, why would you chrono it? If you don't want to get there quickly on the other side, use your Krono on another wave of probes or something like that or save it for your Stargate units Always think of why you're chronoing something rather than just chronoing it to Krono It's now going to go with double adapt It's something I don't really recommend to play a double-adapt sacrifice or double-adapt across the map if you don't chrono both of the adepts If you want to do a play like this, go ahead, but chrono both adepts, because then you can get to the other side of the map quicker. The usual speed timing, or the usual timing that speed finishes at, would be about 328, 329 So speed should have been done at this point Luckily for Spotlight, that's not quite the case, and he's going to be able to escape with these adepts and even gets a little bit of damage done so that's nice Gets to go home safely and he'll live to see another day Full-up is going to be gases All right It's possible I just don't know this build Builds two adapts as well from these gateways This adapt isn't properly set up in the wall either And it continues going in with these adapts Now, once again, in this game it is fine. But I don't think he scouted the speed timing, so it actually isn't fine Even though it is doing damage and it's working out, it's not actually the correct play And this happens often in StarCraft 2, where the play that gets someone in a good spot isn't necessarily the theoretically correct play Using Adepts the way that he's been so far is theoretically very risky You'll notice that if he ever plays against someone that rushes out speed, we'll just lose both of the adepts and most likely die to some kind of Ling flood Wouldn't surprise me even a couple of weeks I'll get an IOLus complaint from this guy complaining about the power of Ling floods. Or maybe he'll watch the replay and realize that you shouldn't lose two adept for free Anyway, I'm drifting off here as we have charge Two extra gateways No, third base Okay Third base as well Now this looks to me like it's going to be an R-comprobe And the reason I say that is if you're going for a pure charge, a lot of attack, rushing into four gas before taking your third base, is kind of ridiculous, right? What are you getting the gas for? Salads don't cost gas The unit that costs gas and is a good gas sink is the High Templar, and thus most likely this is going to be going into an Arkon drop. Instead of going for a prison, he opens up with an immortal It's a second forge as well Okay, three forges It's going to get good upgrades at least Now it gets an Oracle Okay, this is not the correct order of things I kind of was, you know, I was giving him a little bit of leeway I was like, all right, these adepts, that's weird Just a single Stargate unit, that's weird But this is just bad now Getting the Oracle this late is absolutely useless The power of the Oracle is that when the Queen Count is still relatively low at 4 or 5, or sometimes even just at three, you can do some damage. You can deal some damage on the other side of the map Also, in StarCraft 2, the earlier you tend to do damage, the bigger the impact If a Zerk is on 60 or 70 workers and you kill three workers, that is a very small percentage of their income However, if a Zerk is only on 18 or 20 workers and you kill three workers, that's an insanely big percentage, like what, 15% or so? That's huge You're denying them a lot of, income and it really snowballs later on into the game as well So if you want to be using oracles as an harassment unit, do that earlier in the game rather than later into the game. On top of that, getting extra gases really quickly to start flowing a lot of gas tends to be bad for the economy And I've alluded to this many times before, many, many times The only resource in the entire game that creates more economy, and this is true for all three races is minerals You need minerals to build next side You need minerals to build supply structures and you need minerals to build workers and for Zerk also overlords Well, that's I guess the supply structure So the more minerals you have, the more gas you eventually can get because you can expand quicker, that type of stuff. These extra two gases are really good if you want to hit a very specific timing with an Rcon drop, for example However, if you're opening up with triple forge and your arcone drop is going to be hitting at what, like the freaking 7 30 minute mark, then you might as well just have taken a third base first and saturated those gases faster, which you could have done because you would have had more minerals With more minerals that snowballs, you would have had higher supply as well, and you still would have been capable of doing this arcone drop Okay, so you have these two arcons in the prism right now And they're going to start harassing, I bet, at some point as well. We're curious to see if they ever do get to their to their goal. They go in right here Zerg isn't completely ready I can't really blame the Zerg for that either because this is the worst timing for Archon harassed that I've seen in my life like at this point the Zerg already is uh considering what type of hive tech he wants and my man is still hitting with his first true harassment it's not quite what you want. As a result he really gets well barely anything done four workers killed so far and he returns well I think it's going to go back home I wouldn't mind if it just rotates towards the left side or just stays here and then goes back in you know forces the queens to stay there maybe can force away another drone pull instead he's going to go to the tower maybe get a little bit of map control okay makes well not a lot of sense but perhaps there's something here okay it's not taking the tower either the same time let's take a look at what these triple forges are doing. Wait, he cancelled one forge, so he's on double forge Plus two And what is this? He's going to go shields for armor Now has to be shields Shields it is Prism is still idling here And let's take a look just for a second Let's do the, well, those again, the mid-game army composition review All right So we need to start with the scouting in order to properly review someone's army You need to know what they have scouted My man has seen absolutely nothing He's seen the fact that a layer started I think he might have seen one or two hydras as well on the map, but he hasn't really seen much else However, he's still getting a decent army camp. He's getting immortals, salads, and archons If his opponent had opened up with Muralisk, this game would have been completely over There's no anti-air that is quick to defend mineral lines There's not a single cannon everywhere There's no blink either, so a stalker warping wouldn't have done it this is terrible If Muras were what the Zirk would have gone for, our boy Spotlight would have died, well, about five minutes, well, three minutes ago, maybe For everything else, though, I kind of find his army okay He's getting high immortal count, or trying to get a higher immortal count He's a couple of Arcons, Templar and Zellat, and he's a pretty decent probe count as well. So overall, I think you pass the midgame Army review for the Army composition check whatever it was called Here comes the prism This prism has taken quite the path Look at this This would be the most disappointing prism in the world What? Okay Just a recap The prism hit this base at seven minutes and like 50 seconds, something like that It then picked up, went back to the tower, idle there for 45 seconds, then went into the main base, went in the phase mode and died. This is a little bit like going from Germany to New York, except rather than flying straight to New York, you first go to South Africa, you stay there for 25 minutes inside of the airport because you're not allowed to leave and then as you see New York on the horizon, your plane makes a nose dive into the Atlantic Ocean It's kind of similar to what Spotlight did here with this prism If I were a unit in Spotlight's army, I would not want to be entering any prism in the near future Okay, so the transition is going to be into DT, second robo, and Fleet beacon I like the Fleet beacon, and I can even kind of see the second. second robo for higher immortal counts I really do like that Fleet beacon for carrier, mothership, maybe even Tempest I mean, all of that is kind of good One of the main tricks against Lurkers often isn't even so much what army you have, but where your army is positioned And moving out on the map, it's almost always a good call against Lurkers The reason for that is, is once the Lurker settles into a position, it becomes really difficult for you Oh, it's a good scouting, by the way, here Seize the complete army It becomes difficult to for you to engage into that position If you're attacking, however, those positions are going to be positions that the Zirk wants to defend. And while you're busy fake attacking, is what I was going to say, you can transition into an army that can clear the lurker So at this point, Spotlight sees this and says, okay, I know where he is currently, and what I want to do is I want to transition into something different He goes for disruptors I don't really like that, honestly I much prefer things like carriers Disruptors always feel like you need a crap ton of them to do well And even in that case, they're still super microintensive They're not actually a hard counter to the lurker because the lurker can unburrow in time often But this is obviously not a fight that you can take. The reason it's so obvious because your opponent has freaking 20 lurkers or something and you just don't have the units You're down in supply You still have 4K in the bank Most of the time, if you have 4K resources in the bank, and, well, actually it's more like 6K resources in the bank, gas and minerals combined, and you're not maxed out yet You want to stall the fight You don't want to fight ASAP Now, he warps in six stalkers on slow pilots What? Why does he think that is the correct call? I feel like that is pretty, probably the worst unit that you can have against the lurker Maybe an adept is worse than a stalker Adepts probably worse than stalkers. At least you can shade away The stalker is actually completely useless Such a terrible unit against lurkers And one of the issues here is that I actually want to go back into time a little bit here Okay So we're going to start before the first fight again The first fight here, which Spotlight, well, this is actually the second fight already I think he already has a fight before that So the first fight that Spotlight has is a fight that goes very wrong He has a 171 supply army against 185 supply of lurkers And he's not fighting in a great position He doesn't have the greatest army positioning either against this. And there's a bunch of units that are still running around the map, not really here So he loses us a fight in which he is down 14 supply His Templar are all full energy and he decided when the fight would take place Okay Now with this in the back of our mind, we could perhaps predict how future fights are going to go if our setup is exactly the same We don't gain any tag Our supply has decreased rather than increased And our position isn't getting much better either So here, once again, we're down 20 supply except this This time we don't have any Templar remaining Our army is already bruised and a big part of our supply is in the completely useless stalker. Right now a big red alarm should be going off in your head spotlight and that alarm should be telling you that it's time to perhaps change it up, to do something different If this has gone wrong once already and you were in a better spot at that point, going for it for a second time is obviously not the correct call So for a second time, this goes wrong, you pull back I'm like, oh, okay, that's good But then you just decide to do the exact same thing again The moment your opponent unburrows for half a second, you go in, you lose 10, 15 supply You just keep dancing back and forth. Now, I realize I'm criticizing a lot and I'm not giving any solutions Here's an easy solution that you could have been going for while you're holding a choke with Immortal Templar So whenever he moves forward, you storm at this point You storm, you shoot one of the lurkers and you move back And he basically has to leapfrog forward You pick off one unit at the time very slowly While you're doing that, you're doing a big zealot run by into this pace or into this base or into this base Just try to get some damage on the other side of the map This could also be done with a prism somewhere. He does have a lot of spines, which is a good call out of the zirg, honestly But if you send in 12 zealots, believe me, four spines are going to fall very quickly, especially because you have two to upgrades So they're quite powerful against the spines On top of that, while you're doing that, so you either need to completely cut off eco and reinforcements and then slowly but surely shave this off, or what you can do is just try to do eco damage and buy time while you're tacking into something bigger And whether that be carriers, tempest, or, in your case, disruptors I'm not, like I said, I'm not huge on it, but it is possible that they will be somewhat valuable. I find it hard to believe that they're going to be super valuable if there's three vipers out already Actually, I find it almost impossible to believe that they're going to be very valuable if there's three vipers or four vipers out already Now, this warping to me, I just completely don't understand First of all, it was a slow warping, but also, like, why would you send this in? I just don't get it Like, you know that it's not going to work And this is something that I see very often at the lower level in general is where everyone knows Like my dad, my mom, they've never played a game of StarCraft 2, but they'll look at that. They'll go like, oh, that's five of those small proto's looking units into 12 of these guys that are throwing blades on their ground They're like, hey, it's not a good idea The low level player knows that it's not correct to send in the zealots there, yet the low level player sends in the zealot because he doesn't see an alternative But the alternative is not losing the units and saving them up, or sending them across the map to fight against reinforcing units This is always an option Why are you not doing this? Well, here you're disruptors Imagine coming out of the robotics facility, and these are your first two shots Nothing going to be very happy with that. Then the vipers pull you in as well Good Lord More stalkers? I'm not quite sure who told you you that stalkers are the counter to lurkers, but if you have that person on Facebook, you might want to consider unfriending him Because that's not a real friend That's an enemy He's just keeping you close Oh, another shot Actually gets three hydras this time around Still are floating 4K as well You are at this point, you're not completely dead because you have a lot of money If you had slightly more production, like 12 gateways, I could see someone warping in a lot of zealots here and then sending them across the map. It's just painful to see you do the same thing with the zealots again and again Like, really, was this the best use of your zealots? You damaged one HydroLisk back to 3 HP Lost eight zealots for that You did 87 damage on one Hydra for 800 minerals That's a good investment That's great That's absolutely fantastic You're completely dead at this point He's in your production But for whatever reason you're still playing Nah, okay This is unfair with me So if this was anyone else in the world, if this was anyone else in the world, I would say staying in here and hoping for a miracle, perhaps it's not the correct goal But in your case, your writing is extremely, extremely bad. Your StarCraft 2 playing is atrocious as well If everything in your life is as bad as these two things that we've seen out of you so far today, then perhaps the only thing that you have is hoping for a miracle And then I completely understand it There is no way that you're going to achieve anything using your own talent Because you have none, apparently At least not for the things that we've seen so far Maybe you're really good at, I don't know, juggling or something It's possible, of course, or something else that I wouldn't be aware Solving Rubik's cubes, you know, I've seen people do that really quick Magic tricks There's lots of things, but writing and Starcraft perhaps isn't quite it. And then waiting for a miracle is a completely viable solution I mean, we've heard of things like this happening in the past, you know One second you have water, next second you have wine Boom, just like that I guess that's kind of what spotlight is waiting for right here Because there's no way in a million years there's going to be winning the same I like the DTs though And I like the fact that he's not sending I like the fact that he wasn't planning on sending them in, but they got pulled in I'm not going to blame him for that He had the correct idea there And this is something also that I noticed But this isn't even low level. Why do I keep pretending like these guys are freaking silver abroad? It is a master's level game Very often at the lower levels, people kind of put units in categories, you know? So in their head, the dark Templar is in the category of an harassment unit And the zealot is a fighting unit So whenever they build zealots, they often want to fight with it But when they build DTs, they'll use it for harassment Or if they snipe the detection for fighting They build these very specific categories But StarCraft often is a game that's way more fluid in a way It doesn't really, these units don't really fit in these specific categories And they kind of go in between. Sometimes a zealot for one second is good as a counterattack And in the next few seconds, it's great to function as a flank or to just fight in a straight-up engagement And this is a skill that is very difficult to learn. but you need to be capable but these probes I think it's the second recall that they see I think it's a second recall and I once heard a theory about like teleporting and that type of stuff and I think the only way that teleporting is truly viable is if you store all the information of the human body and then you send that information and then once that person walks into the teleport machine you kill the person on the one side and then you basically build that new person up from scratch with the information that you send over So really, this is the third version of this probe, is what I'm trying to say If that makes any sense. If my explanation wasn't completely correct, you can tell me all about it in the comments as well I love to hear it when I'm incorrect You guys are always very passionate when I make a mistake as well I do like that passion Some of you have the passion for improving in StarCraft, too, so I wouldn't have to watch this type of crap I guess it is what it is A couple of parasitic bombs Spotlight gets absolutely blasted And I think at this point he realizes that his water is actually going to stay water G G well played Evan wins the game I'm going to have a quick look once again at your balance complain You realize you were floating too many minerals. That's the first line that you sent to me I agree Your macro just wasn't good enough here, I think You were lacking extra production you had 7, 8, gateways, well, you should have had 12, 13 Your transitions weren't quick enough either You could have transitioned into carriers way faster with the amount of money that you had or into anything You could have stopped building stalkers as well when it comes to the army composition If we don't even look at the macro anymore, the macro part, we leave behind us We know you filled that You knew already when you sent me this, that you failed that That's not focus on that. When it comes to the unit composition, I think the disruptors just, Just aren't that great of a choice Once the Vipers are out already, you really want to be getting into that air The stalkers as a midgame or late game transition even, it just really, it just doesn't make any sense, in my opinion It just, it really doesn't You say that you need a lot of attention to deal with the lurkers in the midgame, and it seems too much compared to how much effort the Zirk has to do to actually do insane damage That might be true but you also just didn't have the correct ideas on how to fight them. Sure, if you have a unit that sieges up, it always will require less attention than the person that has to deal with It's the same with the siege tank But these units have other weaknesses Like the lurker, it can just transport very quickly from one place to another If you're attacking at home, at his house, he can do anything about it The lurker also doesn't shoot up Every unit has something that feels broken about it And in the case of the siege unit, it is that they're very good at controlling spaces once they're into the position. And one of the things you can do is try to not let them get there or cut off the reinforcements to that position that tends to work well against siege tanks, tends to work well against lurkers as well You didn't do any of that You just kept attacking into that siege position again and again For whatever reason, whenever people do this against tanks, they can see their mistakes, but they see their lurker as a completely different unit because it moves a bit quicker But it's similar in everything essence that if you see 12 tanks, you wouldn't engage into that But if you see 18 lurkers borrowed, for whatever reason, something in your head goes, oh, that looks fine. I think I can do that But it's the same You simply can So, yeah, when it comes to judging the army fights, when it comes to your army composition with the stalker, it just wasn't good enough You, yeah, this had nothing to do with the lurker And your final sentence, the finally I should probably have transitioned to disrupt this earlier I also said incorrect It should have been carrier You, my friend, you just suck And the lurker is completely fine All right It's going to be it for today's episode of Is It Inba or Do I Suck?

        "text": "Dear Harsden, I enjoy your content very much and would love to hear your feedback of this TVZ match I played against my friend I am a platinum player who got onto Diamond with luck, so my build and micro sucks If you got into Diamond, you got into Diamond because your MMR said you belong in Diamond You didn't get in Diamond with luck, you practiced, you beat players that were either in Diamond or slightly below, you got their MMR, then you made it into Diamond I don't like people complaining about balance, but I also don't like people underselling their achievements Always be proud of your achievements, even if compared to other people it isn't much Because getting into diamond, it's a good job. You should be proud of that It's not because of luck, it's because you deserve to be there Your build and micro might suck, but you did deserve to be in diamond All right I copied the build I saw from a TVZ tournament match, which Maru used going against dark Although in the tournament it didn't work out as Maru expected, however, I found it very in test-dressing, thus I tried to copy the build In this match, I successfully declined his hatchery two times and had a plus-one plus-one advantage in almost every late-game fight However, I still managed to lose due to the investor Roach combo. I stuck to your previous TVZ episodes' late-game advice and not using a monotonous M-M-M army, Marine Marauder, Medevac, because I don't have the confidence to utilized ghost, well, thus I produced only Liberators However, even with the help of Liberators, I cannot win the match because my lack of knowledge when it comes to countering opponents, army components, or I just suck at SC in total Please hars them Is it me, or is the investor Inba? It's a very good question Name half cookie, Ray Sterran, League Diamond, well deserved, and server China He doesn't sound very confident in himself, and I feel a bit bad about that, Because if you made it into diamond, surely there are some things that you do well. And it seems that you're aware of your errors and your underlying mistakes, your weaknesses So you seem like a pretty reasonable guy But then you do complain about the investor and the investor roachcom position in general You mentioned you were playing against a friend I assume this is your friend I wish I knew what these words meant Whenever I see these Chinese characters, I always regret not studying any Chinese language It seems real nice for all these replays. To be fair, how could I have known when I was a young man picking whether I was going to go for French, German, Chinese or Russian that one day a lot of Chinese people would be sending me replays to roast them? I didn't know that when I was 14 That's when I made the decision to learn German What makes do you yet? Ah, yeah That is good That's my bet, I guess We have a barracks and a refinery coming up here for a heft cookie It's just opening up with a standard build order And because he mentioned copying Maru, one of the things I want to do is just take a look at what Maru does Uh-oh. And what halfed cookie does in this game Probably still, I see the letter C here So there's probably something about that Zurich is completely underpowered And he's saying, no, Zerk is very powerful and I don't know how to kill the entire army and how to burn the carpet That's what it is in Chinese It's burning the carpet, clearing creep I was like that Okay, reactor first I think I have an idea of what this is going to be So, Maru recently went on a bit of a bout of three wrecksing in tournaments He did it against rogue on curious minds I think he also did it against dark on curious minds He might have done it against Cyril, but I can't quite recall. he opened, I think that was in King of Battles on Curious Minds I'm not sure if he played three wrecks there We played it a bunch of times on Curious Minds, maybe even once on glittering or Berlin as well I can't quite recall This build is really cool So it's a reactor first into triple barracks Yep This is the only reactor first build that Maru has done And the goal is to hit with 19 to 21 Marines at the 5 minute mark 502, 503 is when Maru hit when I watched that replay You get three very fast barracks You get Stim and Combat Shield And while you're moving out, you get an eBay and then a factory. And when your factory finishes, you get the starport You build the reactor with the factory, swap the factory and the star port And then the factory goes into one of the tech labs of the barracks Your first pushout is with 21 Marines Your second pushout is with two MEDAVX and 16 Marines if after you lose your initial 21 Marines And then your third pushout is when you have METafact 3 and 4, and they pick up two tanks and eight more Marines So then you have a, I can't do mad, 24 Marine Army with two tanks and four MataVX And I think you have one at that point It's a really nice, tight build order that is extremely fine-tuned. And when you're copying a build like this, it's important that you get the details, right? Because the devil often is in the details And what I'm seeing here is a player that, A, stays in gas for way too long After you build your command center and your first reactor, you pull one or two workers out of gas to increase your mineral mining, get a faster second barracks, a faster third barracks because you have more minerals And then after your second barracks finishes, the SUV that was building that second barracks builds the refinery So this refinery is 17 seconds too fast And that first gas was mining too much gas as well and we already see a big gas float. I'm saying this every single week, and I'm going to keep repeating it Whenever you mine gas too early, your economy gets worse Because the only thing that increases eco are minerals Please put it in your mind, guys If you want a better eco doing a build, you want to mine minerals as long as possible, and get into gas the latest as possible for your timing attack The rest looks pretty fine He's looking for overlords here this is a move that Maru often did with either four or six marines, looking for one overlord on the map, killing it, hoping to force out a couple of links, and then returning back home. It is important with these Marines to not lose them, because they really add onto that later push with the Stim and the combat shield You will never be capable of killing queens anyway, because, well, there's going to be at least three queens How are you going to fight three queens against four marines? It's not possible Attacking the hatchery here is, it just makes no sense whatsoever, right? You know that the queens are there Speed is also finished There's like three different ways you can die right now So way number one is you attack this hatchery, you kill the hatchery, but at the same time your opponent is Ling flooding your natural That would be a possibility You would absolutely die. You wouldn't have enough Marines at home to defend this The second way you die is if your opponent is Lingbanebusting, you also just straight up loose. The third way you're in a bad spot is if he just trades with his queens against your Marines and the fourth way which I guess is the ideal scenario is when your opponent builds 12 to 14 links so he cuts a couple of his own drones and then kills your Marines that way he loses six to seven drones but you also lose your four Marines and then he gets the drone up and I'll have the links for later so none of these scenarios are good you're basically doing a move out and the commander lays out four scenarios that end up with you losing Perhaps it's just time to cancel the mission at that point, half cookie. It's not a good idea to just start walking across the map without having a goal Always think in the back of your head, hey, what is the goal with this push? What is the best case scenario? What is the worst case scenario? If your best case scenario is that you're going to be down 150 minerals, that's not a good scenario, even though it is your best case Now, your next move out, as a result of that initial moveout, is also going to be worse This is 13 Marines, I think Actually, it might be easier to just count the Marines at home 17 minus 4 13 Marines Good job, Kevin. So it's a 13 Marine pushout that is hitting very close to the actual timing So I said 502, 503 with 19 to 21 Marines So you're hitting with 6 to 8 Marines less here Because you lost 4 and because your build wasn't completely tight, you already had two less than Maru did with this push You're going to stim in, and your opponent has absolutely nothing It does have a lot of workers, but nothing else Starts building roaches This is good for you, but it obviously could have been better had you had more Marines here I mean, just would have been more powerful But honestly, this is not bad And now here's a concept that I hope you follow. And that is knowing when to go back So often, I often talk about this in when I see a Protos matchup as well So what they'll do is they'll have an Oracle and there's a queen there And they'll kill 12 drones and they'll lose the Oracle But there is a point in that period where you're busy killing drones and that queen is attacking you where you can kill the maximum amount of drones and still fly away So you preserve your unit and you have maximum damage output That's probably going to be nine drones or 10 drones, right? So and then what you have to do. is you have to think, hey, is it worth it for me to kill two extra drones and lose my Oracle, or is it better to kill two less drones and keep my Oracle alive? And 99% of the time it's better to keep your units alive and kill the one or two workers less that allows you to go away So you end up losing like three, four extra marines because you wanted to sniper queen or maybe four extra marines because you want to sniper queen It's not ideal, but I still honestly like this situation for you Your follow-up is good here You go into the Marines Okay You went in reactor mines here and that is not quite proper. Two reasons why this is not proper One, it kind of exposes you for roach play Against roaches, the ideal hard counter against roaches is not actually the marauder, but it is the tank If you get tanks against roaches, that generally is quite good for you So what you want is you want to be producing tanks with this factory this barracks wants to be on this reactor That's very important If you do that, then both of these buildings are on their ideal add-on Right now this barracks is producing less marines Well, it's producing marauders, so it's not producing any marines, but it could be producing two marines at a time, which has very high DPS. And this one could be building tanks, which would be super useful against roaches as well So this is not quite the scenario that you want And once again, like I said, the build that Maru did, was really relying around that two-tank push that he follows up with with four Metafax that you're just kind of missing right now You're also not starting your plus one armor immediately, but overall it's still a situation that is pretty okay Your third base is done Your opponent is on three bases still as well because you, I think you denied it now for a second time or maybe he didn't start it yet Anyway, the third base is still gone. There's no Evo chambers, or if they haven't been researching yet So you're actually up-in upgrades The only problem that I see so far is that your unit comp isn't really evolving into what I would like it to evolve Ideally, we'd be getting tanks right now and a lot of Marines We can keep the tanks at home, send two MataVX across the map to try and do some harass And when you get attacked by roaches, you get everything back home You defend with the tanks and the Marines And hopefully you're going to be absolutely okay Your mackerel is good, though See, you're a little bit too hard on yourself, I think, buddy. You said you have no skill or bad macro, but your money is extremely low this entire time You hardly are getting supply blocked Oh, Liberator Okay, so you're skipping a couple of steps here, you know? I'm sure that in previous episodes where TvZ is happening, I said something along the lines In the late game, you want to get to Liberators and Ghosts You don't want to stay on Marine Marauder But you're skipping a couple of steps here You need to go up to five Barracks first, then up to eight Barracks And that is when you start your transition Double Factory, eight Barracks, awful four bases. Like the typical layout is you go three racks or you go three base, you go three racks, then you go five racks, then you add a second factory Then a fort base, three more barracks on top of that, and then you decide what your follow-up tech is going to be, whether it's going to be ghost, liberators, or maybe a third factory for more tanks That is all fine This is basically like you watching a tutorial video on baseball, and you're only half paying attention, and you hear the goal is to go back to the home base, you know? And you don't know really much about the rules in between. So you start running towards the first base, then you skip second and third base and just run back straight away and then you start celebrating That's kind of what these liberators are right now This is you celebrating after running to first base and then going back to home base That's not how baseball works That's not how StarCraft works either Because you need to do the intermediate steps as well to build up an army that these late game units can kind of supplement Late game units often are a supplement Except for the ghost, the ghost is just, yeah, entire army by itself It's a support unit, main damage output, tanking ability That unit has it all It's a complete man. The ghost is truly the Arnold Schwarzenegger of StarCraft 2 Governor, Filmstar, Bodybuilder Overall nice guy Seems like a nice guy I never met him Gives up a good impression too To be fair, if I wouldn't say that, he might beat me up Okay, is it not the greatest fight? Okay, maybe that was a bit of an understatement when I said not the greatest fight This is a really bad fight You walked straight into a couple of piles, and then you just walked up a ramp where he had a massive concave in Vester Roach You were fighting with pure marine marauder, no tank support, nothing Actually, resources are lost still in your favor, though And you're outmining your opponent pretty heavily. At this point, we need to start adding two extra barracks As you can see, your production isn't actually keeping up currently with your income Often people look at this and they go, oh, my macro is not so great But the issue here isn't your macro The issue here is just that you're lacking production Now you're getting the fusion core At this point, you're truly even skipping the first base You just go halfway to first base and then run back home Start celebrating like you just ran a home run It's not how it works It's just not how it works Fort base before Barracks 4 and 5 as well Floating a lot of energy on all of these command centers. A second armory? I think you're misunderstanding here Yeah, your goal is to get a big army and then really supplemented with these late game units, these lips, the tanks Tanks are important against roaches Let's not forget about that Tanks do extra damage to the roach and also thanks to splash damage They have long range They're generally good as a backup unit Now, what I'm not saying before next game you sent me in is you playing a single barracks pumping out marines and then you're throwing down three factories and two armories is that you just literally only build tanks that would be Mac That's a different play style. What you want is you want to kind of complement the marine strength together with the tanks A tank has a long range and the marine can kind of kite back to those tanks You can deny some creep, ideally not fight on creep You're probably going to get some decent fights It's what I would say Going straight into Liberator, it's just not super, super useful, especially because your opponent has Reveragers as well and Reveagers are quite okay against Liberators if there's no tanks near it because the lips just they'll just get biled down and there's nothing to zone away the roaches and the Reveagers And there's even a couple of hydras It's investors as well You start moving out. You are getting the advanced ballistics which I like We're getting a fort base which I also like I like these extra barracks That's a good call And you're There's some things that in your gameplay, very good It feels like you generally have a concept of what you want to do You abide by timings, at least semi-okay, especially for a diamond level player I feel like a lot of things you're doing are good But then other things just Oh my God Okay, well, that went a lot better than I thought it would for you That didn't Okay, I need to see this again This move, okay? This is like chasing someone that has a knife while you're blindfolded Your entire army is clumped. And what does the investor want? He wants a clumped army You're just completely hoping that your opponent is either asleep or doesn't have a hotkey right now for the fungal growth ability And as we can see by the APM, your opponent isn't asleep And honestly, even without a hotkey, he'd be able to land this fungal just by clicking on the mouse Then he gets another one Look He actually hits your entire army I didn't even know that the diameter of the fungal growth was this big, that it could fit that many units, but you were so freaking clumped You mentioned that your micro isn't the best And with that I would actually agree. Your micro, so far in this game has been very mediocre And I don't think it's because you can't micro I think you do know how to micro I just think you're not patient enough You're afraid of the Zerk army Perhaps you haven't played with this composition much before and you want to end the game as quick as possible And as a result, you kind of panic and you just go in But you don't need to do that You have an army with the Liberators that you had that you slowly but surely siege forward Liberator, and ideally, like I mentioned before, you have a couple of tanks with it then you send in small forces of bio kind of pre-spread. And sure, it might not be as good as clam Or, well, it definitely won't be as good as clam If it is as good as clam, then you can message the team liquid management, and perhaps we have a spot for you But, yeah, it's just about patience You can do it slow, but just try to do it properly I rather have you do it slow and properly than quick and run everything clumped up is it's not going to work for you Then once again, you're stuck at home You go into extra factories, even though you haven't been using this factory for a while now, that obviously should have already been increasing the tank count You get an orbital command on your fort base. Now, I'm all for experimenting with orbitals on fourth bases and not copying what the pros do But there's a reason why the fort base 99% of the time is a planetary fortress, and that is because it just adds a lot of safety to the base and the benefits of the orbital command don't quite outweigh the benefits of a planetary here as a fort Planetary here also would have died, though So in that way, I guess we have a similar situation We can pretend that it never happened in a way Workers moving forward This was kind of clumped up, these liberators, but they're all seized Once again, you're unseaging every. at the same time and that exposes you to your opponent just attacking straight into you Just take your time, unseach, at least keep one there and then unseach four of them You know, that would be extremely helpful I don't even mind this move out forward This is good This is exactly how you should be doing You're just pushing your opponent back Yes, look at this This is absolutely brilliant And now you siege them up No We leave one seached and then we go in with the four others Okay, now all of these are clumped They all get hit by the same fungal and look at that All get hit by the same bile as well. These were four biols and one fungal on a clump of five liberators and all of your siege units just died This is why you do things slowly rather than panicky Lurker is in the backer destroying you and now your tank production starts But it's the wrong order around You ran from the first base back to home base and now you're going to the second base It makes absolutely no sense It just makes absolutely no sense You have 3-3 Your upgrades are good You're always up and upgrade But upgrades are only useful if you have units that are fighting well against your opponent's composition And at this point, that's just not the case And you only have Marines and Marauder Right now you're dead. But honestly, in that last fight, you probably could have been up six upgrades and you still would have lost it You clumped all your liberators, which were the main zoning tool that you had against the lurkers You lost all of those And then your army just dies because this army composition is better People often think that Starcraft is just completely a mechanical game, but the strategy and the unit composition and the decisions really do matter And a lot of your decisions, almost all of them, were incorrect And it's the same with your micro It's just kind of poor It really was And it sucks because I like your build order I liked your over your macro has been good. I think you're, I mean, for diamond 174 I don't know I feel like these guys are quite fast for diamond You're like 3 2K MMR as well So it's kind of low diamond I find them quite good And at this point, this Eric's just going to move in and there's really nothing you can do He still siege up the tanks if you want to try to play But your opponent has freaking 9K resources And often the best thing to do here is to just respect you and your friend's time Respect the time with me and the viewers as well Just leave the freaking game. you can have a try in another game watch the replay by yourself I mean this is what are we here for you know no use absolutely nonsense 65 supply against 169 gg yeah you lose the game yeah I actually kind of feel bad for you and for two reasons the first reason is because I genuinely liked your macro if I looked at this game and I looked at the macro and I looked at that early game builder Yes, I saw some small mistakes But for your macro, for a diamond player, I would have said this is midmasters, maybe You did that well It's just after the early game, it felt like there was no plan anymore. You had a plan for the first five minutes, and that went okay Well, it went well You kill the hatchery You're in a good spot But then from there on out, you have no clue what to do And it's important to have a plan Because if you don't have a plan, what ends up happening is that you'll look at this game and you'll go, oh, Liberators didn't work, but you can't quite figure out where it went wrong because there was no real decision tree You just blindly went into Liberators So you were like, okay, in your head, right now, Liberators aren't good Next time I try battle cruisers And then battle cruisers don't work And then you'll try another unit. But you need to build this up Like you go bit by bit So first you play the early game, then the midgame Early game went well Then you follow up with the midgame It's going to be tank push and stuff like that, then you can kind of evaluate the situation from there and out and then see what the proper counters are to whatever he does If you don't want to play ghost, which is fine, I understand ghost can be quite difficult to control on the lower levels Also on the higher levels, they can be quite difficult to control That's fine, but you still need these initial intermediate steps So for your macro, I'd say, good. For your army composition, I would say, no, absolutely not Too many marauders no tanks whatsoever mines against roaches absolute nonsense as well yeah that's not good when it comes to the micro yeah it wasn't it you consistently were clumping up all of your units your liberators your army you were chasing investors with a completely clumped army you walked up a ramp initially perhaps the best fight you took was when you lost four marines against three queens because you didn't make any mistakes in that fight In every other fight you made mistakes Even in the fight with the four marines against three queens, you killed nothing, but at least you know, you didn't fill massively or miserably. So for that you also get a big, unit composition was an eh, then this was an eh, and then your infrastructure obviously sucked Double armory before a fort barracks, fourth C, before a fort barracks Yeah, absolute nonsense once again I guess it kind of ties in with the armor composition Push it all together into a nice little pile And you, my friend, do suck massively Investor Roach isn't imbalanced It is easily beaten by tanks, but you just decided to not build them And does she lost?

        "text": "Captain! Send your best troops to Burlingrad ASAP I played a game where my opponent, which I found out was a GM-smurfing post game, went Mass Reaper which I scouted into Mass Marine My response was a hidden base plus blink Colossus Colosses can't blink It was no matter as Reaper's heart counter, every Ground Toss unit I considered going air, but I had too much pride to do that, since I should be able to win against this, playing standard, even against the 1K plus MMR Smurf I scouted late tech slash turd, so I thought I should be equal to a head, but I couldn't get my own natural up People balance whining about void race or lurkers? Nah, reapers, man. Please tell me how to suck less, or if I should pick up a slower game like League of Legends Thank you for your service This balance complaint was all over the place The name was Pico, dog, he's a pro-dose player in Masters League on North America And there's one sentence that I really want to focus on here for a second I considered going error, but I had too much pride to do that since I should be able to win against this playing standard This is something that people somehow got in their head that it is more honorable to win playing standard if someone does something offbeat or something weird. Actually, the best thing to do, if someone, is playing something offbeat is to hard counter that, no matter how you do it, that would be considered a standard response Whatever is the best response is the standard If the best response is air against Mass Reapers, which let's be frank, it probably is, that would be a standard response Standard is not a word that you can just put on a matchup Like, let me pass the game You can't just say in PVT the standard is to play Blink Colossus and then just applied it on that matchup in every situation Because if you're playing against Mac, that simply isn't the case The standard against Mac might just be mass blink stalkers or Charcelot Immortal Arcorn. It is very different And people also differ on my opinion what the standard is or what the standard should be The word standard means absolutely nothing and is completely useless But if it would mean anything, it should mean the best build against whatever is happening or the best response if I would say the standard response against the 12 pool is to get a second gateway and to chrono zealots out That isn't the standard in PVZ The standard in PVZ in the early game is to go for a 20 nexus If you go 20 nexus against the 12 pool, you die The standard changes, depending on what your opponent does. It makes no sense to say, \"I don't want to play air because I'll lose my honor and pride.\" Because going air against Mass Reaper would be standard. If I scout someone going triple Rax Reaper and I get a Void Ray out, I win the game. That sounds like a pretty good standard to me. That is the type of standard world that I want to be living in. If I scout something stupid, I have a good response and I kill it. Why would I make life harder for myself? Why would you do that? It doesn't make sense. And then also saying, even though he is 1K MMR above you, yeah, well, that makes a lot of makes even less sense Why would you go for a suboptimal response to someone that is this much better than you? If anything, you should be pulling out all the tricks against someone that much better than you Sure, if his build is suboptimal, the reason it's suboptimal is because you can abuse it If you, okay, I'm so sorry, but we're going to have to go over here Imagine you play against someone only building drones, the entire game long, only building drones He has like a million drones, like 120 drones. And once he gets one of 120 drones, he does a pure Brutlord push, okay? If I know this going into a match and I'm about to play against this guy, there's five different things that I can do First of all, I could just attack him with any amount of units in the early game and he would die because he only builds drones Or I could just save up mass void ray because Brutlords don't shoot up I am changing how I'm playing based on what my opponent does I change the standard. If I would just go into a campy game, go into disruptors and triple Stargate, even though I have all this information about my opponent, that would make me a complete idiot and it doesn't make any sense The standard response, the standard changes based on what your opponent does It is not just something that you can just broadly apply. Like, how broad do you want it? In that case, are you even allowed to have specific things in a matchup or is the standard always the same in the entire game for a race? It's just, how do you even respond to any type of cheese then? It's like, well, it's not standard for me to build a battery in my natural, so I guess I'll just lose against his two racks Like, it's just, it's completely nonsensical And it took me almost four minutes to explain that to you I am not the most efficient speaker All right Let's actually have a look at the game, though As we have a triple Rex Reaper here coming out of Jotech. And we have a double gas into a second gate here for Pico Now, like I mentioned before, honestly, if I would scout Triple Rex Reaper, I would open up with a Stargate I would not open up with a Nexus Actually, the proxy Nexus, against Reapers, I think it might be worse than against most other things Because the Reaper is a unit that likes to run around, check out different rotations So this is a very significant risk It also has very high speed, so it can easily rotate in between this base and your main, if this ever gets found out. If you're playing against a more standard Terran army and you take a proxy base, they're less on the map if they open up with a widow mine drop There's just going to be one drop to your side And then they might actually be scared It's like, oh, there's no natural That's weird But in this case, this army should be very good at scouting because it's just really, really quick I like this little Reaper wall you have here That's actually quite good, Pico I do enjoy that You're getting a third gate as well as a robotics facility You're chronoing your warp gate I think this is a second time I've seen the chrono on the warp gate. now and it seems pretty consistent with the timing that it's going to finish up You're also here defending a ramp, which I think if you know your opponent is massing reapers, just defend your mineral line immediately He didn't jump into it, but I think he could have cleared a couple of workers if he was a bit faster I think the battery is a good call So I just want to really kind of plan the flag here where everyone can see it I think the response that you've decided to go for at this point is absolutely one of the worst responses that we can have The proxy base, it leaves you very vulnerable if it ever gets scouted You're just basically dead. It's also kind of obvious that something weird is going on I mean, you're not playing an aggressive build order, or at least not a tight timing You have 20 workers with who goes for an all-in and then completely saturates his main base Like, this build is genuinely one of the worst responses I could have seen in my life Also, can we just talk about how you said that you wanted to play standard and then you open up with a nexus on your fifth base location? Like, even if you're following your own logic, this doesn't make any sense Nowhere in PVT ever is this standard Well, a natural in your fifth and then going into a second gate before a robotics facility. This is a build I have never seen in my entire life It's just not a build, okay? We're going to leave that behind us and we're going to judge you based on the weird mental boundaries that you have set for yourself So we just completely forget about the build order this is the worst thing I've seen Okay, we put that in the in the freezer, you know It's going to be there It will be there in a couple of years from now We'll forget about that Let's hope it just won't rot So it will give an awful smell I'm just going to judge you what you're doing based at this point. So the things you're seeing with the tools you currently have in hand So you just, if this was the state you got put in, I want to judge you based on the decisions you're going to take now and the moves you're going to take now I like this recall This is obviously good You want to saturate this base, you don't want to rally workers from your main towards this base because they're just going to get picked off That recall is quite smart I do enjoy that I like the little patrol I have here on the adapt That's good. I think these stalkers could be a little bit more here in the middle in between this ramp and this ramp as these are the two main areas where your opponent could move into, basically So I don't really mind that The prison, now this is an extremely risky move He saw that as well You really have no vision whatsoever of where your opponent's reapers are, and you just start to move out with four stalkers in a prism Look at what he currently has He has 12 reapers, about to be with plus one as well He has 12 reapers You hardly have any units at home. If he would have jumped up the moment you load into this prism, you would have just straight up died Okay? And it's not like this prism is going to go across the map for game-ending damage This prism is going across the map to harass, to kill one or two workers Not like you're going to go for a DT drop where the potential of actually killing your opponent or doing a lot of damage is very high Now, you're taking a very large risk for a very minor gain And usually these are not the correct place You know, it's just, imagine you have, a lot of Americans have this. So a lot of Americans, I'm not quite sure what it's called, but they have this thing next to their sink and you put stuff in there and it cuts it up It makes it small It's like a trash shoot or something like that And something, sometimes, it's just like a blade spinning to make it small I'm not quite sure how it works Some American invention, you guys will know what I'm talking about if you're American Sometimes something gets stuck in there Now, this would be like if a little walnut gets stuck in there and you put your entire hand to push that walnut down while the thing is still spinning. Like the best case scenario here is that you push the walnut down and that is not going to be stuck anymore The worst case scenario is that you lose your hand That's kind of what this prism is as well This prism is not going to give you anything It's going to slightly improve your life, if even Actually, you know what? I think this actually is a giant loss because while you're doing this, oh my God, you're sending these across the map You're also floating an infinite amount of resources Like actually an infinite amount of resources Look at this Freaking 800 minerals, 400 gas you had. You could have already been building like either a robo bay or just anything, really any type of secondary tech, faster Twilight Council I don't even mind that too much, to be quite honest with you I don't even mind the Twilight Council as a secondary tech as much I think it's okay to get blink against this Keep your stalkers alive But you lost three stalkers You floated a lot of money and you kind of made yourself vulnerable here You also mentioned in your thing, in your balance form, complain, that you had trouble taking a natural Well, I'm not really surprised you had trouble taking a natural as you're trying to take a natural with three stalkers against like freaking 12 reapers with plus one. Like obviously it's going to be difficult to take a natural You just lost three stalkers across the map This prison, by the way, is keeping a lot of reapers at home So you could say that it's kind of worth it But at the same time, it's also If all of these stalkers were at home and you wouldn't have lost the three on the other side of the map, I think you would have been perfectly capable of getting a natural, getting a battery there as well Once you get a battery, Reapers just don't work very well anymore Like, Reapers in general, they don't actually skill that well, especially once you get Colossi out So I do like the call of the Colossi. We can see that you don't really have the gas currently to get both Blink and Colossi out So I like that they're taking gas three and four but I don't understand why you went for the fast twilight if you realize that you need to go into quick colossi anyway This seems like an awfully naive thing to do as well is to kind of move down here Rather than kind of waiting for a big unit or a big force and then moving down, you're just constantly trickling down a couple of units to try and defend the base that realistically is never going to get defended, right? You're just taking huge risks and you're hoping your opponent just isn't paying attention. So you're moving down with four or five stalkers You know your opponent has what, freaking 20 reapers or something It's 25 reapers with plus one Your colossi is about 20 seconds away and you still have a hidden base At this point, what I would say, just wait till your colossi is out In that case, your fights are going to get a lot better And now you might just, if you actually want to defend this, he has all of his reapers here If Jotak would fight here, you'll just lose all of your stalkers I don't understand why you're so keen on defending this position, which is obviously undefeiting, defendable It's like fighting outside of your castle walls while the cavalry is about to arrive. Just wait these 10 extra seconds for this colossi and now you take it This is the correct call I'm glad you didn't go chase the reapers or something like that That would have made absolutely no sense Prism is still alive as well And to be quite frank, yes, your position is bad in that your downing workers He has a lot of infrastructure But on the other hand, your third or well, I guess your natural hasn't been spotted yet you're getting an army that should fight extremely well against his army Colossi stalkers I mean, that should Colossi absolutely destroy reapers It's not even close Once you get like two three Colossi out, the game just kind of should end, honestly. And I think this is a very winnable situation because all of his army supply freaking sucks He's 32 Reapers, that's it As long as he doesn't find this hidden base, you're completely fine So this is why I'm so surprised that if your entire life depends on this hidden base not being found, why you would start rallying workers from that hidden base towards your natural location, increasing the chance of being found out by about 10 times It just doesn't make a lot of sense I like this battery here, that's good I also don't quite understand why you decided to go for a blink before the Colossus here You always kind of, you gotta think of the impact that any specific, upgrade or a specific. The impact that a specific unit or a specific upgrade will have in the fight And if you compare what a colossi or a second colossi would have as an impact in the fight compared to blink, the colossi obviously has a way greater impact and does you want that one quicker? This is I just don't understand this I really just don't understand this I want to go back to this point where you lost a prism I kind of glossed over that But there's two things that happen here First of all, you know that with this prism, you're keeping a lot of reapers busy There's just a lot of reapers on your opponent's side of the map. Then you lose this prison and you see a crap ton of units in your opponent's natural as well So you know there's a lot of units on the other side of the map and all of these units have something in common They freaking suck against Colossi Okay The colossi for you is absolutely the saving grace It doesn't matter if you're down 20, 30 supply If you get 3-4 colossi out in this game, his army will disappear from the face of the earth. Then why would you start attacking across the map with eight stalkers and a single colossi without thermal lands? Even if you were ahead in this game, okay? And even if you had an opportunity to attack your opponent in the near future, why would this be the correct timing? Let's just look at this logically Your army currently consists of 1,300 minerals and 600 gas Okay, 1,300 minerals and 600 gas You have plus one started in this forge That's 100,00 You have blink started in here, 150, 150, thermal lands 150, 150, another colossite, 300, 200 You have almost as much invested in buildings, that won't be ready for a fight if you take it now, as you have in your entire army. And this investment isn't going to help you whatsoever unless you wait 50 seconds So why not just wait the 50 seconds. This is one of the greatest anti-timings that I've seen in my life, and it's not like you've seen some vulnerability The last thing you saw is that your opponent had a crap ton of units at home, and he sniped your Warp Prism You know he's up in upgrades because you can click his units, and you can see that his plus one is already done There's absolutely no point for you to go. on top of that you know that your third base is faster because you actually saw this base build as well you have zero incentive to move across the map absolutely zero incentive to move across the map and what is it you decide to do you move across the map then when you see his entire army you lose eight or seven of your stalkers you have to recall home wasting energy wasting your stalkers you review your hidden base and you lose your colossus you lose your colossus So really the entire sequence here was you scout the fact that your opponent has more army, has a later third base, and has an army that is going to be a lot worse against you once you get three colossi out. Your reaction to this is that you move across the map with an army that you're still heavily investing in with upgrades, with another colossi You have some gateways you can probably warp in with as well You see that your opponent still has more army because your army didn't think increase in size whatsoever and his, oh, he got another five marines, just straight up blast you Then do you reveal the only thing that's keeping you into the game and you lose the colossi, kind of resetting the timer on him because there was a timer on him to either transition into a better army or to kill you Those were his two options. And as he wasn't really transitioning into a better army unless you count a single raven as a better army, he really had to start killing you soon and you just kind of gave yourself up It makes no sense whatsoever And I mean, yeah, now there's just too many reapers He's just going to kill you Walks him with it These marines don't even have stim or combat shield, by the way No stim 10 minutes into the game Is it? This is a master's level game, by the way If this guy is 1K MMR above you, I guess he would be Grandmasters Even if this was true, I don't know if this is true I don't care for checking Hamster might check it. I don't really care personally even if he was 1K above you It doesn't really matter Your decisions were just terrible It doesn't matter if someone's smurfing, if you keep like cutting off your own leg at every single part of the game It just doesn't make any sense Look at the power that this single colossi will have here in this fight, okay? These armies are not quite comparable Actually, they're quite comparable on size If we're not going to see a fight If he would fight here, we would actually see what a colossi would do to an army like this It would not be close. Had he just built the three colossi and had kept all of these alive, I actually think he could have won this game I really do believe that There's not a single tech lab except for this bad boy that's researching Stim currently I'd be surprised if this guy is GM, by the way Like his macro still is really sloppy Just the unit comfort really doesn't make a lot of sense Even if you're smurfing, I feel like you'd have better mechanics than this Yeah, at this point you're just straight up going to die He's forward If this Colossi can just get like three snout three four swipes, yeah I think he did he just kill his own Colossi? I want to see that again. Does he actually just aim on his own Colossi or what happens that? Does he just look that way? No, he doesn't damage the He's I was looking at these Marines not taking any damage He's just shooting his own units with the stalker as well Just because they get inter You gotta be smurfing? Gigi I mean, these decisions were honestly so This is This is a stunning game This really was a stunning game I just want to go over it from start to finish one more time and we'll judge you on multiple things I already told you about the build order. Your build order is one of the worst things or your response to scouting the three racks is absolutely the worst thing I've seen in life Your logic also makes absolutely no sense I could already give you an absolute suck stamp just based on your build order and your logic, separate from one another You put these two together and you get the abomination that was your early game here It was really, really bad And I don't want to be mean, but It surprises me that this happens It, they, it, I really believe that if you'd hit Masters at some point, you would understand that the standard response to something is just the best response You get, you just get your air units out. And even if you don't, like, the proxy base into a three-gate robo with a prism, it just doesn't follow for me I just, I just don't understand it And yeah, I, I just don't So for that, big thumbs down there, my friend Not a fan of it Not a fan of it Second of all, your decision making in the midgame, the moveouts, the weird trying to take your natural base with like four or five stalkers to three times It's like you can't judge any fights, even though you almost every single time had full information You knew from the start it was going to be Three Rex Reaper So you had full information You made the absolute incorrect call. then afterwards you know how many units there are on the map you keep trying to take your natural down which is also absolutely the incorrect call not waiting for your colossi then the third thing is while you're researching all these things and you know your opponent has a bigger army because you just killed your prison so you won't even have reinforcements if you do end up pushing you decide to walk on the map and that also is absolutely the incorrect call so based on all these three things is your decision making your early game and your logic and well actually your micro The only time I saw you control your units was when you were attacking your own colossi. So on these all four things, my friend I'm sorry, but I have to do it You You suck You suck real hard And that's the truth All right That's going to be it for today's episode of Is it Imma or Do I Suck?

Helcat, he's playing against a fella named Waldo We finally found him We're looking for him for a while Hellcat is a diamond terran player and these often show a lot of the characteristics of the higher level diamond players where they're very whiny and they lose a lot as well to random things just like most terranes do He's just going to go here and lookers Hey enough to do with StarCrafts unit Look at this You just see just, oh my God I'm dead Dang it Kind of curious to see what Hellcat is going to be doing here Sends out a second SCV Okay. So this is too late for a barracks, but it's too early for a regular scout, you know? If he wants to proxy a barracks with this, that would be a little bit like a getting a Christmas card during Easter It's just too late, you know But if this is for a scout, it's also kind of like getting a Christmas card for Easter, except too early So the same analogy working two ways there It's the first time for everything So we have a hatch first coming out of the This also wasn't even in time to block the hatchery Like, this was the worst SEV scout in the world It just falls right into the middle of being completely useless. You lose a bunch of extra money because you send it out earlier and you don't get to block anything You don't get any more info earlier on You don't need to know whether your opponent is going pool first before you want to build your reactor That is the timing you care about because the response, if you scout pool first, which usually you would scout at two minute marks when your SUV arrives a little bit earlier, 156, 157 If you scout your opponent, opening with a pool first, you can just add a second marine after your first marine and you can get a low ground bunker All of these responses are still in time If you scouted earlier, nothing changes. The only time this would be valuable information is perhaps if your opponent is playing a proxy hatchery and then you can build your CC on the high ground But if you know your opponent is doing a proxy hatchery because there's no hatch here, you can also just continue marine production and get a bunker So really it doesn't It doesn't matter It's just worse what I'm trying to say, basically This bad scout Bad scout Not a good scout at all All right Hellbat, no sorry, Hellcat is moving across the map with his Reaper He's also arriving late with his Reaper I wonder why that is Maybe just didn't send it over in time Did he open up with gas first? No, he didn't. There's a couple of things here that are feeling a little bit funky, okay? timing-wise I'm not a huge fan of that And he just patrols his Reaper in front of his opponent's base I kind of feel bad for this Reaper The Reaper has like a 10-second window Okay, I just want to follow the life journey of this Reaper real fast, okay? Because the Reaper is a very special unit The Reaper has, in this matchup, about a 10 to 15 15 second window in which it is useful Now, this window has already been reduced because for whatever reason, Hellcat decided it was a good time to keep the Reaper at home for a little bit longer. So look at this Reaper, okay, already arriving five seconds later That is 50% of his useful lifespan Okay? First, he didn't even know whether he wanted to go into the main or towards the natural Then he gets the order to patrol in front of his opponent's base Back and forth Look at this. back and forth back and forth meanwhile the queen is out this this is where the timing of where the reaper is useful ends at this point this unit is completely useless and the reaper knows that as all he's not an idiot he knows that once the queen is out his bullets are nothing he might be able to pick off a creep tumor and write home about his great success but he's he's a useless fella at this point This Reaper is well aware of that and as a result he just decides to end it He doesn't want to come home with saying he didn't even see battle once He'll have two shots, three, four He hits a Ling four times and then he dies. This is the most useless Reaper I've ever seen It didn't scout anything It didn't deal any damage It did force out the links but that is really the minimum That just happens by building the Reaper That's not an achievement whatsoever That's the opposite of an achievement That's just a thing that happens automatically It's like when you get a kid, you automatically become father or mother, you know? That is the starting achievement It's like the things you get after the tutorial in a video game, you know? It doesn't really count Like you can't write that on your resume, that you're a father or a mother I know there's people that try doing that. And I'm sure that Hellcat will also write on his resume that he build a Reaper But it doesn't count We're not buying it, Hellcat No one is buying it, okay? Also, no one wants to see the Facebook pictures of your Reaper We don't care Benchie on the way here, third CC Actually, for how bad everything has been so far, his build order isn't even, it's actually quite good This build order looks honestly quite legit He's building Helions, getting a Benchie as a third CC He's not building as many SEVs perhaps as he should, and he's keeping the Helians at home to guard this ramp Absolutely brilliant It's like buying a flamethrower to roast some marshmallows. It's like, I'm sure it will do the job, but he also just could have done that with a matchstick or, you know, just in a campfire, like a normal person, idiot But he's very keen on keeping this ramp for whatever reason Maybe he's just, actually just guarding the unbuildable plates Rheen walks into the main base, starts attacking the Overlord This is a lightning quick response he had here as well that all oflors have been floating around in his base for the past 35 seconds If you have this, uh, if you have this marine on guarding duty, uh, and don't think your house will be robbed empty before this guy comes over Absolutely, absolutely great. Another fantastic timing here on the Hellions as they arrive at 5-11 I feel like this is, this is really just the, the tail of this game so far, is that our boy Hellcat seems to just be too late everywhere They're just absolutely too late every single time He's the type of guy that would pardon a turkey after the Thanksgiving dinner is over It's like, it's too late, Hellcat It doesn't count anymore We ate him yesterday It's like, now the Benji's fly over cloak already done about 20 seconds ago So I'm glad to see that he's sticking with the theme at least. gives me something to talk about because he actually this is so it's so weird he's just doing everything slow but he's doing the things quite well like the barracks he has three barracks gets two ebays like the order of the things is correct but it's just it's just everything is just a little bit slow like if he was a pizza maker and he was making a margarita like the the way of putting the things on the pizza is correct but we just take him three to assemble the damn thing Okay, and here we go wrong No, actually, he gets the second factory and five barracks before the 4th CC It just looks so close because he was floating a crap ton of money. But once again, the order of things is just so frighteningly correct It almost looks like a good game It almost does if you didn't know anything about timings If time never had been invented and if clocks weren't a thing, this would have been the perfect build order perfect build order It really would have been because the order it's it really is correct Well, it forgets this plus one armor, but everything else I'm a fan of Hellcat. Another thing I'm a huge fan of by the way is that he believes that all of these units are one-time use and that after you do your initial damage, it's only proper to go back home with these Banshees, you know? You don't, you don't want to stay too long on the other side of the map. It's definitely not some you want to do. He's a man of etiquette and proper, you know, being proper in general in life. He doesn't want to annoy his opponents too much. He uses it once, the surprise effect. And then from there and out, he leaves him at home to once again guard the unbuildable place. Yeah, the most interesting Sensor Tower location I've seen in my life. Hellcat will get the warning of the censor tower when the freaking bailings are in his mineral line already Ah, that is big, my friend That is very, very big Or if there is an overlord hiding over here and he comes into the natural to put anitis He'll get a good warning of that as well, about two seconds ahead of time The greatest sensor tower of all time I didn't think it was possible, but we found it, ladies and gentlemen, close to the imbibble places Aha! This is why it's over here This is the most optimal location where it doesn't block any food traffic, but it still provides a lot of vision to truly protect these unbuildable plates. I'm not quite sure what our friend Hellcat actually has for static objects, but he seems to really, really like the unbuildable plates Viking on the way now as well, out of a reactivis This is kind of new to me, the Viking Matterfac combination He's very keen on killing this overs here I guess because it's showing on this mini, it's like this stupid red dot on the mini map You should have never built that sensor tower Yeah, this is once again, we're just a little bit late with everything This opponent is casually building 10 overlords He's preparing for a freaking tsunami over here, the amount of food that he's getting Viking will take out the overs here. Yeah, so usually after this build, I recall you hit a 630 timing with two minutes metaphics and 16 Marines Hellcat right now is aiming for about the nine minute mark Well actually his second Metafact isn't quite out yet He does however have eight more Marines than most people had two and a half minutes ago So technically that's an improvement But because we are capable of knowing time and looking at clocks, I am actually not that impressed by this performance Not yet Okay Here comes with us drop and he's going to hit a solid three minutes after it really is supposed to hit, which once again he's doing the correct order of things, but the timing is just, well, extremely late. I'm not even quite sure how it's possible if you do the correct order and then just still be late It must just be very slow This APM also isn't that low It's 107 You should be capable of clicking the things at a certain correct speed then It's not like this APM has been tied up in controlling units either because the Helions, well they got sent home, the Benchies they got move commanded into 35 hydras just now Here comes a bit of micro Okay Kill some units and then picks up again Let's get to fly away So it keeps eight of his marines alive That's good During all of this, however, he has been floating a decent amount of money. Sometimes, you know, I actually never really consciously thought of this So I know how much money won base mines and how much money you get from like 66 workers, you know? And I have that kind of internalized So I look at like three ways I'm like, okay, that's 2,400 minerals a minute or so But I never quite realized how much money you truly spend a minute until you see these people actually capable of floating like 5K resources at the 10 minute mark or at the 9 minute mark Like, it just doesn't occur in my head that rather than spending the money, you just sit on it the entire time. There's just, like, if we look at this money, we can kind of translate that to time Like right now, the income is too high because he hadn't muled in a while But let's just say he gets about 3K minerals, okay? 3K minerals a minute Or sorry, 3K resources, on average I think from the start of the game, that is being rather generous to him and his macro He gets about 3K resources on average, okay? Gas and minerals Right now he's floating about 5K resources That means that for at least one and a half minutes, he hasn't macroed one and a half minutes of income away And don't forget that you can macro one and a half minute of income in about three seconds. Like, it's actually true, especially with tearing You have a lot of production This means that there's just times where he wasn't couldn't controlling anything because these Hellions, they stayed at home for the majority Now they walked across the map again The Benchies weren't doing much The Reaper didn't get microed either He moved commanded that across the map, patrolled it, then sacrificed it into the main base Where has his attention been going? Is the real question? Is Hellcat perhaps one of these gamers that plays two games at the same time? Or perhaps is he like one of them stock traders, you know, that whenever he sees a good trade on one of his other seven screens, he has to quickly click it. It is possible because I have no clue where his attention has been tied off Often in lower level games, when people are floating money, at least you can say, well, it makes sense because this guy was controlling his Reaper like his life depended on it You know, they have like 1200 APM with a Reaper But Hellcat hasn't done anything like that, quite like that at all He's just been sitting at home looking at stuff And now he's looking at his bases die I assume at least he's looking, no, he's just looking at his tank He starts microing once again Scans for us Oh, yeah, that's a lot of lurkers Lurkers, no seismic spines, no quick burrow either 12 minutes into the game. Like, he was extremely unprepared for everything, because he just had so much money in the bank Now, these lurkers, they slowly but surely, they burrow forward They're taking everything out And then this is where Hellcat is going to make a stand And we know why this Just guy patrolling around the unbuildable blow Oh, he's going to leave it He says, well, the tanks are good enough She's going to go for a counterattack And this is the first move in the entire game that I think is actually good This is a good move Going for a counter attack where you're under very heavy pressure and you have units that can't fight your opponent's army Yeah, this is a darn good call I love this. Just go for a freaking drop It's going to A, win you a little bit of time Oftentimes, at lower level, it's going to force your opponent to just run their entire army back home because they have no clue how to split armies And while you're doing this, you can build up a solid defense at home Look at triple tanks Two more factories on the way You can get triple tank production going here Wow And honestly, if you survive in this game, you might just be fine because you have a lot of money Like, sure, your ego got hurt a little bit You're still 62 workers, though you have plenty of bases It's not even that bad You have a freaking planet. Talking about wasting good manpower here, these mules repairing this planet that is actually physically hurting me So this third base is going to be under some heavy pressure, but there's going to be about five tanks Sadly, there's also still 16 Marines in these metaphics Thanks to the high ground, unload the Marines, thanks to the high ground, unload the Marines Thanks to the high ground, okay It's a little bit slow, but he gets it done eventually Also lifts this CC Now, don't forget that we still have a lot of barracks that technically can be producing These two tanks, they're stuck on the high ground I don't think that is on purpose. What is this barracks doing? Oh, he wants to, I think, be capable of moving these bad boys If all of these tanks could actually escape their Tech Lab prison, he would probably be fine Even now, if these tanks could just move over here, I actually believe that Hellcat might be somewhat okay Like if he just sets up a defensive position, it's obvious his opponent doesn't know a lot about proper engagements, you know? So far, like this guy just walks into tank fire the entire time We have the opportunity right now to kind of set up I mean, we just, we just held a big attack We still have a lot of money in the bank We have a creptone of CCs as well. Like we can build workers if we want to Five at a time Like that will go pretty fast That will go a long way There's money for extra command centers well Sorry, four at that time I thought there was a CC here Parix is going to assist This is the perfect time to build up We actually survive with a bunch of siege units Our opponent is on freaking Roach Hydra, 73 workers Once again, if we just built some marines here, get to Metafax And we get these command centers I'm not saying the game is even but we could be at 150, 160 supply and we'd have very valuable supply Well, our opponent has dog crap supply. Like, what even is this? It's pure hydra It's just going to die to freaking eight tanks Plus two vehicle weapons Upgrades are good Like, we're looking pretty solid The correct decision here is just to go back home We have a lot of money in the bank Like, this is like having you carry with you like a couple of bullets, you know, you can reload your gun maybe once and you finish that and you're done But behind you, there's still this massive like, this depot with just endless weapons and bullets Like, you have lots of ammunition still In this case, the ammunition is the money You could just go home and get that, but you do need to get it. Right now, you're investing a lot into things that are going to be useful in the future, these three command centers You still have four tanks stuck in your main base behind a single tech lab You have a lot of infrastructure, which is super useful because you have so much money, and you have enough command centers that you can kind of effectively mine from multiple bases You're actually in a good spot If you would just freaking use your money, sadly you're not using your money, and you're also not using half of your tank force currently And because you don't really have any Marines, that actually is quite sad Now you kind of realize what's going on It's like, hey, maybe I should go home. This all could have been done way more efficiently You could have just already been set up with these eight tanks while producing freaking three more new tanks, perhaps building a couple of depots, getting more mines, getting the 3-3 upgrades for the bio going, maybe even getting a plating upgrade here or getting plus 3 on the vehicle weapons Like, your position honestly is quite good Just sit at home, send a single metaphak over here, a single metaphak over here, and go multitask or just leave them there I don't even really care Just whenever you get attacked, you send them in, you stim them and you aim move on the map or something like that It's also possible, okay, if you don't want to multitask. Right now, the macro is your main priority You want to get rid of that freaking money that you have Your opponent is maxed out already, so he wants to trade, and he's going to start trading Finally, your four tanks move out Where are they going, though? So three of your tanks are on the other side shelling away at an extractor One Liberator is guarding this Vespine geyser You had four unseached tanks over at your third base and nothing but like two or three mines defending your fourth Some great decision making here It's also obvious that to me at least, oh my God, this can be a fight Look at this. Imagine, honestly, imagine that there was three more tanks and just 25 Marines here I think you actually would have won the fight I actually believe you could have held this fight Because then the Lurgers can just burrow straight into your face They first need to go towards the Marines You can kite back with the Marines Meanwhile, the tanks are shooting Your opponent is once again maxing on roaches And this is the beauty of low-level games, is that even when you're losing very hard, often your opponents just have so many falls on their own that you can always get back, as long as you get to an area in the game where you are more capable or more comfortable, competent than your opponent. However, I'm kind of sad to say that I don't think there's a single area in this game where you are more capable than your opponent or really more capable than most people that I've seen play It has been a little bit of a sad affair and to kind of add the rotten cherry on top of the nasty pie, you're also staying in the game way too long You have 41 supply left You still have some money, but this is the worst situation you've ever been Yeah, Gigi There we go Took a while, but you get it in the end The Gigi This was a nasty game This was a nasty game Halcat Waldo really kind of figured you out. And let's just look at this in a logical way Okay? So, first of all, the compliments I want to give you some compliments because the order in which you did things, that was great you know, if I ever need someone to put things in order for me, whether that's, you know, from a group of people in height, you know, from tall to smaller, or, you need my closets cleaned up and you just happen to be around, you can order my books, then you'd be the guy to call For a StarCraft game, however, I don't think I'd even put your name in my phone because the units that you built, although they were the correct units, never got used correctly. The Reaper completely missed his timing The Hellions missed their timing The Benchies missed their timing But the initial damage at least was good Then they went back home even though they had full HP basically Then you send them back in at like the nine minute mark The Helions also made a reappearance like five minutes too late, obviously No initial creep denies You were floating a crap ton of money Your entire unit movement made absolutely no sense You moved out when you shouldn't have You stayed at home when you should have been moving out You don't quite understand how SimCity works as there were like five tanks stuck in your main base for, honestly, I think, majority of the, maybe five or six minutes. You had four tanks there It's a very, very vital moment It really was quite painful to watch I don't enjoy that I really don't And like I said, your macro just really sucked Your decision making was proper terrible as well I just want to kind of grab that form again What was was really you complain about The Zerg's ability to rush and destroy complete bases is just way too powerful Yeah, maybe if you wouldn't have invested your entire army into defending the unbuildable plates, it would be a little bit easier to defend the outside bases where the game really matters The replay will show you. They lose a lot of their own troops, but at the same time deal a lot of damage to the eco of Tehran Honestly, the eco wasn't really any of your issue Like, your money was always fine You died having 2K, 2K in the bank or something like that Like, it's, the eco was completely irrelevant in the game The problem was your spending was just way too low And your unit controls got awful You do apologize for your macro not being the best I mean, yeah, that's really just the case here Yeah, you also say that the Zerck's ability to remix instant is a bit too good I mean, Zerk in the fight didn't even lose that much. And Zerk had a lot of money, and he was just injecting He was macroing better than you He controlled his units better than you He had better decision-making My friend, Zerk Yolowing in and killing you, isn't overpowered You just suck You really do suck I'm sorry, buddy All right It's going to be it for today's episode of Is It Inba or Do I Suck? Where we delivered another big suck stamp here for Hellcat Thanks all so much for watching if you didn't join it Don't forget the like, but subscribe the channel Hopefully we'll see you all next time for a new video Bye-bye."

        "text": "Dear Harsham, as a fan of your IOTIS series, I'm really sad that you can't see how Imba, Zealot Archon in Lower League TVP and Chrono Boosting to Catch Upgrades is I am a Platinum player, so no one can expect me to build Ghost or use them correctly and hit the EMPs My beloved tanks get crushed by Zealots and Marines get evaporated by the Archons Even when I'm ahead, six upgrades, dropping multiple bases at once, being ahead in workers at all times I'm not able to overwhelm the Protoss and finish the game Even if he didn't use a single storm, nor was able to split up his army to deal with drops. I know I could have built Liberators for stronger siege, but I thought, I'm so far ahead that I could break him without Even if you may see I'm sucking there, you might take a deeper look into how fast the Protos could catch up in upgrades if he perma cronos from zero zero to three three The moment this upgrades kicked in, he could easily overwhelm my army If Zelladarkon isn't Inba, chronobo boosting upgrades is definitely Name Amandus, race, Terran, League Platinum and the server is Europe All right, let's head into this game and see what are good friend Amundus, who does type out good luck and fun has for us here Kind of excited. I do have to note that I've been getting a lot of Terran replays just in general as a rule I know that the audience mainly is going to be Protos, so you'd expect the most replays to come from Protos I do believe that's true, but I always notice, of course, anecdotally There's a creptum of Terran's complaining Now this can be due to two reasons One, people that whine a lot are naturally inclined to pick Terran as a race, you know, it seems to fit them well Or if you just play a lot of Taran, you become a whiny baby It's one of the two, and I'm not quite sure which one it is. If anyone wants to conduct a study on this, if you're a researcher at any university or some other, some type of lab, you can contact me and maybe we can work something out why it is that Terrans tend to whine so much why do they feel so superior to the other guys the other races it's a good question also a good question is why the scout is so early but I don't really mind it I much prefer seeing people scout too early rather than seeing them scout too late and that's exactly what Amandus is doing here Sakari is the opponent is a protos player nice solid protos player who hopefully will get some type of cybernetics core. I think a good timing as well 127, 128 For platinum, I like to see it It gets one too many probes, but these are all details And I know that's where the devil is, but Sakari doesn't really seem to care Should really get a second pilot, though All right Reaper opener, which most likely leads into either a triple-CC opener or a factory follow-up, but because this is back at Industries, This almost certainly has to be a factory opener Because triple CC on such a small map might actually get some risk involved Reaper, Marine, okay, I like all of that This is cool Yeah, yeah, yeah And then it's going to be It's a little late with the factory, but it's fine. Reaper starts moving across the map Okay, it gets a barracks here It is a little bit confusing to go for a two or a three rex opener and playing Weeper Marine Interreactor And I can explain why this is confusing as well So whenever you open with a three wrecks or a two rex, one of the main factors on deciding how successful that attack is going to be is the number of units as is the case with most attacks, right? The reactor is such an important part of getting out as many marines as you can, that building a Reaper and a Marine pre-reactor is just really bad We never, almost never see someone play 3 wrecks with a Reaper first. And the reason for that is because a Reaper takes, I think it's 36 seconds, which is double the time of a Marine So a Reaper ruins two entire marine cycles if those marine cycles were done with the reactor, that could be four marines Adding another marine before the reactor ruins another potential one marine because that could have been two reactor Marines at the same time So getting a Reaper and a Marine before the reactor does, lowers the amount by five Marines And you do get a Reaper as a free bonus, but the Reaper is completely useless in the push So technically you're just down five Marines compared to a reactor first first and you're down four marines compared to a marine interreactor. This is obviously not good if your goal is to hit as hard and as fast as possible which you can with as many barracks units as well It just means that your push is going to be a lot weaker The Reaper also, not just at lower level but in general tends to not provide too much value in these situations when it comes to the scouting. We see he saw two stalkers, saw a third base timing, but no tech whatsoever so he really isn't aware of too much of what's kicking off here as armandis also is doing some interesting cuts here in his worker production i haven't quite seen that yet at the high level but maybe that's a as we call it a a bottom up trend so this is something that gets popular with the plebs and then the elite takes over it is possible that in a year from now we will see terrans make random cuts in their s cv production but it's also possible Amunders just forgot to build a couple of SEPs. He's still doing fine worker-wise because his opponent probably also forgot to build workers a couple of times This is just what happens at the lower level, the platinum level That's completely fine I don't mind that too much There is definitely some ideas going on here We can see that Amundas had some thoughts about how to play three wrecks into eBay, that type of stuff He's floating 350 gas at this point So we also know that this builder isn't tight We also can see that by the timing at which he's hitting I mean, this type of stuff is supposed to hit at the 450-455 with a similar army He's hitting about 30 minutes too late with this army. Still should be capable of taking out this barracks Should be capable of taking out this nexus here Stimms starts trying to fight with these stocks I like how he microde that Kind of push that army away And now just goes for this nexus gets this Nexus basically for free Some reinforcements coming here from the left side as well And if he stims those and if he restims his main army, I actually think he can make a clean escape after pushing this back He probably can take out this immortal and then just run away He just did a lot of damage Look at his resources lost 1275 against 500 This is a really bad call There's a battery here. Okay, this was a really good trade until he started losing all of his units He actually was up like, I think like 800 resources or so, 700 in the resources lost, and now he's down 300 And this is something that I often see at lower levels is where people they don't understand when they need to piss off Just leave At some point, you need to go home and be happy with what you've done, you know? It's like the people that always stay till the end of the party And you all know what happens at the end of the party She either get raided by the police or you need to help cleaning up. You need to know when to leave before helping clean up at a party It's the same with StarCraft 2 Well, in StarCraft 2, the difference is that you are the one that gets cleaned up But here he did fantastic damage, killed a Nexus, sniped an immortal, killed like two stalkers as well If he just would have gone home, life would have been perfect Okay? Would have had a large bio army sitting at home His resources lost would have been heavily in his favor by like 500 minerals And that initial trade would have been great Sadly, however, that isn't quite what happened, and instead he lost his entire army Yeah, it actually ends up not being too brilliant. He's down in supply right now, which is a place you generally don't want to be, and you definitely don't want to be as a terran against a Protos player Now, he still has a very large army He's getting quick upgrades, has double e-base armory almost done, five barracks, and the last thing he scouted Okay, yeah, no This is very good The last thing he scouted was a lot of stalkers He saw an immortal, so he knows there's a robo, didn't see blink, didn't see charge Tanks make a lot of sense against this type of composition More so probably than mines in this case Now, if I recall correctly, in his form, he mentioned charge lot Arcon as the main culprit of imbalance. So I'm surprised to see his opponent so far just opening up with Stalker Colossi I actually think that Stalker Colosser, or just Colossi in general, are hard at to play against than Charged Lot Arcon Because against Charged Lot Arcon, you just have some extremely potent tools that you don't have as easily against the Colossi Against the Colossi, often you just need Micro, while against Chargloid Arcon mines, deal really well with Charged Lot Arcon armies They just destroy Chargots and you don't have to control them whatsoever You just burrow them, they sit there and they do their work There's a cool little drop even though nothing's happening at the same time This drop will be capable of taking out a lot of workers. Once again, he gets a very good initial trait and then go sort of forge here I think at this point it would be wise to have left about 10, well, five to 10 seconds ago This was nice I love that he kind of is sticking with the theme here of doing a lot of initial damage and then losing all of the units that you just did the damage with At the same time, as well, just floating a craptown of money if we once again kind of analyze this fight we can see that Amundus killed like, what was it? Maybe 15 workers 15, 14 workers, maybe 16 I'm not sure how many killed in the early game Let's say 15 workers for free initially. Then he decides, okay, I can now kill two forges or go home He takes out both the forges Then tries to drop over here and kills like one more zealot So that initial start of the fight was really good Then once again, he stays slightly too long And rather than just preserving his units, he decides to keep fighting with them until they die And this is something that a lot of Terran players at the lower level do If they drop, they're completely committed to that drop They never pick up They can't imagine not letting their units die there They die in combat They don't get back home to heal There's not that many metaphics here, it seems like There's a lot of bio. Vikings helping out in this fight as well half the army is in the back It's not ideal, but with the one one upgrades against this largely stalker colossi army and this honestly 50 marauders is extremely powerful So this gets completely cleaned up And honestly the game at this point should be pretty much over I don't think you can just push straight away You're lacking, well, a little of HP If you stim another time, you're going to lack even more HP That's exactly what's happening here Another Stim, That's an interesting one Now here I actually have a very high level tip for Amandus, and that is that the stim lasts for 11 seconds. And some of you might not have noticed, but here in the left side is a timer as well So if you click stim, you can then look at the timer, and you can just count with it, you know, you go like one, two, three, four, all the way up to 11, and then you press the next stim You don't have to press stim every three seconds It doesn't stack Stim does not stack I know some people do believe that, but you can only use it once at a time Like using drugs twice isn't going to make you twice as fast It's just going to make you feel worse And that's exactly what's happening with these units. They are very keen on using them drugs Then we're also lacking some health care here We don't have any meta-vex going into Vikings instead that Kind of surprise that we're seeing this on the European server This guy's just investing a lot in attacking units, not so much in taking care of its own citizens And forcing drugs into their own population I know a country that likes to do it as well He has a Tor Wait, I didn't even notice this yet What are you doing here, Mr Thor? I feel like he's been reading the forums or something something like that. This is something you often see is they have absolutely no clue what to do anymore in a matchup and they go to the Bellonet forums, which is completely populated by Terrence as well And it's like, guys, TVP is unwinnable Does anyone have any advice? And then another guy that hasn't won a TVP in his entire life, or maybe doesn't even have the game installed, goes, I think Tours are kind of good against all of Prodals I mean, they're tanky and they do a lot of damage, why wouldn't you just get them? And my man Amandis in his little note who goes like, check, Thor's That's the future He also has vehicle plating on the Thor. I'm not quite sure why he'd get that over vehicle weapons, but I guess it is what it is Yeah, Thor's completely useless They have no synergy with this army whatsoever The Thor against Prodals, it's like if the police would get a 20-wheel truck and use that to start chasing pedestrians, you know, rather than just doing that in a food chase Like you're not going to drive this string thing through alleys to catch anyone, you know? It might look cool and like you have some type of authority and has, you know, a big armor That's nice, but super useless This could have been ghost And ghost here actually would have been extremely powerful. Because currently the entire army of his opponent consists of Archons, Salads and other gateway units, which all get hard countered by the ghost And the Vikings, I really like that he started started building Vikings the moment all the Colossite died And he saw earlier in a fight that his opponent's army just completely consist of Charcelot Arcon Archon, Charcelot Arcon Immortal Stimps forward Snipes a Templar Okay, now should start running away He sees this army is way too large There's two marauders walking across the map There's a five unit drop in the main base at the same time Look at a store putting in the work, huh? Oh man, that was a great investment Zero kills on that Thor. These guys get a bit of a trade Once again, very low Why is this army so low the entire time? He doesn't have enough metaphax Still has two metaphax over here There's some army here, some army here Just What was this snipe? What did he just try to snipe? Did he just try to snipe a zealad? Yeah, absolutely insane fight Look at this You don't this snipe an immortal I mean, this guy has like a thing called the barrier as well The immortal is probably the worst unit to try and snipe If there's a massive army defending it, that was a very wild play There's still a lot of army, well actually there's almost no army. It's like 20 supply that wasn't in the fight Then you have these two metaphacks that weren't in the fight, these bad boys weren't in the fight This is dropping So actually the army supply here for Amundas wasn't that large And although he's up for upgrades, if your army is just half the size of your opponents, and they also have units that kind of counter yours, usually you're still going to end up losing That's just a fact I'm also pretty disappointed Oh my God This is not going to be a good fight for the ProDol's, is it? No This absolutely is not going to be a good fight for those Look at this This is what upgrades can do This is six upgrades ahead. Look at that Absolutely disappeared If Amundus is spending, would spend any of his money, right here, he would absolutely destroy this This drop also did so much out This guy has 10 kills 10 kills on a marauder, 7 on a marine They're owning right now They're absolutely owning Ford base down, ghost would be really a great choice to go for I understand that ghost, well actually, they're not even that difficult to use If you research the enhanced shockwave on the ghost, you can literally click anywhere on the screen and you're going to hit it you will hit your EMP It's impossible to miss because the radius is like half the screen If you get two ghosts, you can cover the entire screen. You get four, you can cover the entire screen twice You get six, well, you get the gist of it Ghost actually hard counter the Archon, okay? The Archon is a unit that consists of 350 shields and 10 real HP 10! There's like an SCV could walk up to him and knock him out, okay? That is, that is the type of HP we're talking about If you get ghost against this unit, this is a 300 gas unit Imagine investing 300 gas in a unit and are just disappearing because there's a guy with a sniper rifle throwing an electromagnetic pulse at your face Like, honestly, the ghost is the ultimate counter. And I don't understand why all these low-level terrans think it's so difficult to use They all complain about Storm, but yet they're incapable of using a ghost How does that? I don't understand the logic there but maybe I'm the one that's missing something I also like that he has a huge army, 2K in the bank, and he's up for upgrades and doesn't decide to fight whatsoever That's obviously also a mistake Really should add more Metavex as well Look it is Well, he really only has three Metavex that are currently active and there's a huge bioforce, huge, huge bioforce Also I want to actually touch upon the upgrades. So we've so far really just talked about the Charged Lot Argon, which was the main thing that Amandus was talking about initially And he kind of threw the upgrades in there as a what if, you know? That is like the people that are still trying to deny something and then go like, even if it was true, that I, you know, that I pushed your little dull from the building and destroyed it, it probably, you know, I probably had a good reason for it That's the type of thing that he said in the IOTIS firm basically. He was like, you know, even if the Chargled Argum isn't in by, even if there are good counters in the mine and the ghost and I just didn't use them Or I didn't control my army the entire game and I didn't, you know, I overstimmed my army every single time because I didn't have any medevacs and I like pressing the T button very much Even if that is the case, then we still have the upgrades Now, let's get into the upgrades Is it actually true? With the Protos upgrades, there is a funny thing that Terrans always seem to forget when they make these weird comparisons And then it is that Protos actually has three upgrades. Not only do they have the armor and the attack, they also require shield upgrades to completely, you know, fulfill their upgrade thing Their units, all of them have like freaking half or like a decent size, a decent chunk of shield and then a decent chunk of HP as well the Star Wars 80, 80, the Zela has like 50 shields Now, of course, Terranes usually forget about this, because majority of them understand that if you use a ghost, the shield upgrades are completely useless But this is still something you need And there's another thing here is that if Chrono Boost isn't being used, even just going up to 3 3 takes longer for the Protels than it takes for the Terran. Only with permanent chronobo boost usage, or I think if you use 8 or 9 chronobo boost, you're going to be faster than the Terran No, sorry, if you lose like five Kronobo boost, maybe, you're going to be faster than the Taryn But if that's not the case, that the Taryn actually has faster upgrades So we need to spend a lot of energy into this as Protos We have more upgrades And even if we perma-Krono, if we want to get the shield upgrades, the attack upgrades, and the armor upgrades, it is still taking longer than what the Tarran counterpart does So that claim is just absolutely false It makes no sense. You can get individual upgrades faster, but getting to a completely upgraded Trotos army is just slower These are facts You can do the math yourself You can do your own research here, Amundus, and you would have figured it out, okay? You absolutely would have figured that out You're a smart fella Well, you're a person with a brain I want to see that one again So there's a scan here He sees that there's archons I wonder if he thinks that these archons are just standing solo He moves forward Let's take a look at his vision He sees the zealots right now in his vision probably knowing that there's more. Like at least he should realize that these guys never come alone, you know? And he decides to right-click the pylon here And he also, as he got charged on, he doubled down by moving even further into this He just walked into the biggest surround I've seen in my entire life Yeah No crap, you're going to lose a fight if this has happens Honestly, he could have been up six upgrades at this point If you take a fight like this, you're still going to lose Like, there's absolutely no way that you're supposed to win a fight like that It's just not possible The same time, by the way, 2-2 has finished at this point for Sakari. I still believe that if at any point Amundas decides to build five ghosts with enhanced shockwave, is going to absolutely destroy this army This is what? Seven arcons You throw three, you blanket like four or five EMPs on this This arm This army is complete crap It has nothing You could also micro against it You can have mines against it I do like this drop No, you could Why are we always microing into a surround? What? He actually doesn't want his units to come home He just keeps This guy read the art of war I was like, ha If your units believe they have no way out, they will fight harder That doesn't work in StarCraft too They have a sense. that amount of damage Like, no, if the Marine is dying over here or is running away, they'll still have the same damage per second as they usually have Like, it doesn't matter The art of war doesn't apply here, my friend Okay, so this base gets taken out, kind of to be expected if you build a base so close to your opponent's base I still believe at any point if the What does he do these fights? I just don't understand it I want to see this one again Look at this So, he has this huge army He just saw the army as well, okay? It's not like he's not aware He just literally saw his base eye Twelve SUVs went down. He decides to go in He has two metaphics that are going back home for that reason He stims forward, goes into the bushes He like, him, I have no He knows! He sees with the sensor tower that there's units behind this This can't even be a surprise He walks in, he scans, walks out and uses the second stim at the same time while sending the Metafax into their death I honestly couldn't have made a worse scenario for him if I would have tried Like he did everything wrong there It's like 10 out of 10 on the idiot scale Congratulations You messed it all up Another stim They just keep stimming The opponent doesn't even need to use disruptors or AOE. This guy is just killing his own units But consistently, you just second stimped That was two seconds He just stimped twice in two seconds This is the most stim-happy tex I don't think a single disruptor shot has it any of the opponent's units, by the way That is something as well, huh? There really is something And I can understand why that is frustrating for Taryn See the other guy consistently hitting his own units with the disruptor But if you think ghosts are difficult to use, my friend, you should hear about the disruptor Because this ball needs manual control You can't even just click it once Well, you can, but It's basically like a bad EMP in that case It's actually ridiculous. I can't believe how hard Amandos got owned in this game after being so far up Just because he's He's literally just been building Marine Marauder Usually there's Metafax, but he didn't even build a MetaVex Just legit Marine Marauder He stopped building tanks as well I would, honestly, tanks weren't great, but I still would have preferred having some type of factory units over having nothing Mines would have been pretty useful against at least the Charcelot Arcon, as I doubt Sakari would have been capable of hitting a mine with any of these disruptors Ghost Academy could have been very, very, very powerful as well A good call, perhaps, if your opponent's army consists entirely of gateway units and like nine arcons 10 arcons. And this is another Terran here on a little bit of copium, you know? It doesn't quite understand that the game is over You always got to kind of think back, put this in perspective Amandas at one point was up 30 supply and six upgrades, and he didn't manage to win the game at this point Right now he's down 110 supply and even upgrades And now all of a sudden he still believes Like, if you didn't We saw what happened before with that lead He couldn't kill anyone and now he, for whatever reasons, without He's getting two ghosts I thought they'll leave the barracks Like he'll be dead before they leave the barracks. Dishop? I can't get this raptor shot to end with as well Do we get to see one leave or no? Will they see the light of day? Damn, should have built ghost earlier? Yeah Yeah, you should have How is it possible that you make the complete correct analysis already at the end of this game? And then after your moment of brilliance at the end of the game, you decide to write up this entire post complaining about zealot argon, which is literally countered by the ghost I don't understand that But, all right, let's think about this game a little bit Okay, when it came to the macro, I think your macro was decent. You floated a fair amount at times, but your setup was absolutely fine I mean, your five barracks, double eBay type of stuff I really did like that I think it was good And, like, details weren't wrong Everything, all the details were wrong Okay The devil is in the details, and I have some good news for you You will never meet the devil because you don't know anything about details. entire early game is kind of weird and then the second eBay too early your Starport was late all that types of stuff it doesn't matter too much it's fine I was okay with your macro for your level it's good good enough good enough you know you should be capable of winning games with this you can get up six upgrades in like 2030 supply it should be no problem then you mentioned in your form what was it that you said dropping multiple bases at once this didn't happen like this is actually just a flat out lie you dropped the main base multiple times One time two marauders didn't enter your two metaphics and they walked into the natural. That is not dropping multiple bases at the same time That is accidentally multitasking Don't make that bigger than it is The reason why he said is because he saw like multiple red things on the meme He said like, oh, I'm dropping multiple bases It's not what happened You know it I know it Everyone knows it So for the multitasking, honestly, you're going to get a, uh, because whenever you multitask, you did start floating a fair amount And the control also wasn't that good It wasn't, yeah, you just stimmed You stimmed a lot Then we get to the two points where I think you really lost the game One being the army composition You never added any mines You never added ghost. You didn't add liberators either He also got vehicle plating that's separate, but please don't do that again Either get ship weapons or vehicle weapons if you really want a lot of tanks But otherwise, just get ship weapons and get Liberators out eventually Don't get flating Your army comp really did suck You need ghosts You need mines These units kind of micro themselves You need way more medevacs in your army You don't need to build more Vikings if your opponent isn't building Colossi anymore Having two, three, four Vikings around maybe, like kind of as a general rule, might not be bad if they ever switch back into Colossi, but starting to build Vikings after you kill all the Colossi. And seeing that your opponent has Arkon Zellet, just doesn't make any sense The complete lack of ghosts obviously is terrible Complete lack of minds doesn't help you either So for that, it's a Then the final thing is, honestly, the micro It was painful to watch at times It was basically torture If the CIA ever sees this game and they start showing this type of footage to the people they detain, they'll start talking real fast because it was awful to watch Just walking into surrounds, stimming three, four times in mere seconds I don't even understand quite how this is possible I honestly wouldn't mind if you would unbind the Stim Hotkey. I understand that Stim has a lot of advantages and mainly the damage output, but you use it so much that overall it might just be better to not use it at all Just use slow Marines and marauders I've never seen something like this It really was quite bad Also, stop trying to go for fancy snipes on Immortals I'm not quite sure what that was Just kite back, burrow mines, and use EMP It really isn't that hard terrain players It really isn't No matter how much you believe that your race is so micro, heavy So for that you also get a big thumbs down, put that all together and you my friend do suck and you suck real hard All right. That's going to be it for today's episode of Is It Inba or Do I Suck where we deliver another suck stamp to our good friend Armandis If you didn't enjoy it, don't forget it like but subscribe to the channel and hopefully I'll see all of you next time for a new video Yeah Bye bye The."

        "text": "Hello, Mr Harstam Here's a new complaint about Terran This race is so stupid broken with mules and BCs The fact that BCs can jump all over the map without having vision there, not like warping units with toss or put down a Nidus worm, is just broken Even that you can't attack them while jumping in, like you can at warpins or upcoming Nidus I know that my early game was less than mediocre and my response was rather bad I managed to deflect the first incoming BCs and counterattack I get the Terran down to zero workers, but Mules saved him the day. I don't want to complain about imbalance in general, because I know that BCs can be deft in several ways, but in lower ELO it's close to impossible My queens were on two-two upgrades while Terran stuck at zero-zero, but still no way to get him out of my match To talk about Yamato is unnecessary OS, Queens, without even having the option to transfuse them back, is for sure not broken, I guess I guess this is sarcasm So, Captain, is it Imba or do I suck? Best wishes, GST 82 Race Zerk, League Diamond, MMR 3 5K on the European server The main complaint seems to be battle cruisers He thinks that Yamato's are a bit of a joke as well. and I think there's something about mules in there too The Yamato bit was great I like that this is the Zirk privilege that they have, you know, is that they want every unit to be capable to live forever with the help of strength shoes I think it's completely fine that there are things that die in one shot If there's anything that should die in one shot against a freaking sick supply unit that cost 400 minerals and 300 gas, I think the queen is definitely a unit that should die It is a two-supply unit that requires nothing but a spawning pool and costs 150 minerals I always find it absolutely insane that Zerkes dare complaining about something that kills Queen too fast. Queens have infinite HP. They have the ability to heal one another. You get them as a macro mechanic. And on top of that, they're basically free as well and they cost no gas. Like it is and then you complain that a freaking capital ship literally the most expensive unit for all of Terran, one of the most expensive units in the game, is capable of having a spell that he can use once every minute and he can one shot your two supply tier minus one, 150 Mineral two supply unit. Yeah, I think that is actually fine. And that's the way we start today. But let's not be too harsh here on Gxt. We haven't seen the game yet. Maybe he will show us something that will make me believe that the teleportation of the battle cruiser is too powerful, or that Zerk just doesn't have enough tools to quite deal with the battlecruiser That, of course, is very possible 19 workers to start with, all on minerals We don't have a single gas being taken yet, which is a little bit surprising, because this is just oversaturation in the main base, and as your natural isn't done, it's just better to mine from your gas It's more optimal to mine from a single gas right now, and have to catch that up later, yep, with two gases like right here It's going to cost you two drones. And then, yeah, your speed is probably going to be delayed And I don't even think it's that much better with minerals because you're mainly just oversaturated in your main base at the point that you want to play off a single gas anyway So this early game is, as he said, less than mediocre It is quite bad I usually kind of judge it by what the standard is and how well you follow it I feel like this guy invented his own build order and then also executed his own build order pretty poorly, which is of course possible You can make an invention and then also execute that invention poorly. Like technically if you would play some type of two gas, I would probably pull out of gas too at this point to only have four mining, but it's just not that great of a build It's just a bad invention perhaps That might just be the issue It's floating a fair amount of money as well No third hatchery yet Meanwhile at the Terran's base we have, what is this, a barracks producing marines, a starport coming down, two gas already mining It looks pretty standard, except for the fact that there's two marines So it was Reaper into reactor, which is kind of non-standard This Zirk hasn't built a single unit, by the way, yet I'll see this again. Is he not aware that there's Reaper walls? I think that's actually what's the case here So look at this He's not paying attention whatsoever to his main base He thinks that the perfect way to keep the Reaper out is by just walling the front and keeping the Queen in the wall, not realizing that there's a Reaper pathway here and that there's a Reaper pathway here Look at kind of the surprise on this Queen's face We're just going to imagine a face on this Queen, okay? Just wait, once this Reaper jumps down, he's in the wall. He's like, ha, base secure, and it's like, what? Where did this bad boy come from? then he still needs to move there this is like a ZVZ build almost well this is actually just practically a ZVZ build like a two base roach opener in CVZ or like a two base NIDAS where you put down two evos but even then the second Evo slightly later than it is over here so even for ZVZ this wouldn't be the correct build also with ZVZ you actually open up with a single gas and not with double gas queen count is well it's at two now he's building three overlords speed N11 his build is all over the place honestly like there are some things it really just feels like he's making a cocktail of everything he's seen in the past in like different games but he doesn't really seem to care about matchup he's like oh I know that speed is good for my links because I needed to deal with Helians then he's getting double upgrades because that's what you do when you play a 1-1 roach timing against Taryn but usually do it of 3 basis or well you always do that off three bases now he's building some safety roaches i'm honestly shocked that he's up 14 workers um probably mainly because his opponent is not doing much of anything either when it comes to the worker production his opponent is mainly focusing on getting starports out at this moment and gathering a lot of gas i guess for well potential bc's but for now it's just going to be benches no scouting has really occurred yet from the zirk side either the zirk is aware however um four minutes and four 40 seconds into the game that there's two depots on the side of the terran. So, yeah, it's a lot of information right now Two depots, that's for sure Nothing else I also saw two helions already You have some roaches in production Three more overlords He's really just moving from supply block into supply block and then adding three more overlords I think he got supply block at 36, built three overlords Now a supply block at 60 is building three overlords I wonder what the next step is going to be I guess 84 and then three more No, he's preempting it by building two extra overlords right now Not quite necessary, but I guess you'd rather anticipate your future mistakes than fall into the same traps once again So I can't really complain too much about that. 1-1 is going to finish up Now, usually this is a really cool concept, which most of you will be kind of familiar with, but perhaps Gxte 82 isn't quite, and that is the timing attack or upgrade timings Generally, when you are doing some type of upgrade, you're either using it for a defensive timing or for an aggressive timing or to just get a big advantage later on in the game So he rushed out these Evo chambers, cutting a lot into his own economy, the latest third base And then the question is, what is you going to do with that? And he's actually going to go for a timing push. And even though this push by its, well, okay, he's just going to go home Even though this push, I was going to say, by itself, isn't that impressive and doesn't look very powerful, I like the fact that he still has the idea that, hey, I got some upgrades and now I want to use them So even though I think everything about this build order so far has really been bad, like the optimization of this build order is terrible, the idea behind the build order is terrible, the execution is bad I like that at least the general concept of getting something and using it is there. I much prefer that over some people that just rush out upgrades and then never use them, or don't appreciate that advantage or don't appreciate how much they need to cut in order to get those quick upgrades So I do like that he's moving out with this, even though it's not a very good push Two Benchies are on this side of the map There's no real detection There is no anti-air either Now, these Benchies are hitting almost a minute and a half late already, so I'm actually impressed that he managed to survive up to 3 5K MMR in Diamond without having any type of anti-air or any type of detection until the 7-minute mark. As these Benchies now start flying back, still didn't build a spore in the main base It's getting a macro hatch in the main base, though I'm not for sure how it's possible that you can spend your money off, of, what was it, 40 workers while you have a third base and you're playing two-base roadshall in The income really isn't that high You're going to have plenty of larva I'm not sure what the macro hatch is for, but I guess everyone macros differently So he kills every single last worker at this point. So this is kind of what he alluded to in his imbalance form as all, right? He said, I get the tarant down to zero workers, but then the mules are just a bit too powerful When you say something like that, it sounds really cool, but often it isn't just the mules, but also what's left over, right? And in this case, for the Tarrant, there's two battlecruisers and two banshees left over Like, this isn't necessarily eco in itself, but it forces a response out of the Zirk and it's going to deal damage So you can't just say, well, I was up 30 workers. Like, if I, if I all in a Tarrant player and I lose 50 army, supply, but I kill 35 workers, and then I complained that I lost because I didn't kill a single army unit Everyone will look at it I go like, well, that makes absolutely no sense It's kind of the same here Like, you need to still have defensive preparations for the counterattack The counterattack often is the thing that you die against if you're doing some type of heavy pressure roll in In this case, there's going to be freaking, oh, I think three battle, did one die? No, three battle cruisers total So yeah And with your math, you're just going to need a lot of anti-air. Now, a good tool against the battle cruiser is, well, actually, Neuroparasite is a decent tool So getting the infestation pit actually makes some type of sense, especially if you're very low eco I don't mind it too much But of course, the spire also is very good Getting corruptors against battle cruisers, yeah, that's brilliant You get, what, 14, 15 corruptors, and boom, battle cruisers all of a sudden aren't all that useful anymore They will still get a corruptor every single time they move in, but then they need to teleport out or they'll lose the fight because battle cruisers don't actually fight as well against corruptors. However, if you're constantly fighting with queens away from spores and not even with your entire queen count, what's going to happen is you're just going to bleed out queen after queen after queen over time You never get a very good queen count And also you're not going to get a big enough army to truly kill this You need something to get these battle cruisers away from your side of the map And while queens are good at defending, they can't really, force a unit away The only unit that can really do that for the Zerk is indeed the Corruptor or a counterattack. If he would have built rather than 16 drones when he was being attacked by the two BCs and the one bench, he would have built like 10 links and 10 drones He could he would have been able to keep the air units at home for a long time because there was nothing defending on the ground, which means even a very small amount of links could have denied the mules from mining a lot and could have also denied the SEVs from mining, maybe forced them all to go to this base, which does have a planetary, but then you don't have any SEV production from that base, because, you know, don't work like that. Hydra then's being built? So the Hydra then in this case is kind of similar to the Queen in a way I don't mind the Hydra as much if it's done in combination with the Viber Obviously, it is not the correct unit here Like, theory-wise, if we would ask any high level Zerk, they would tell this player right now, hey, buddy, we're going to need to get some type of corruptor to deal with this It's just a fact, like, there's, you know, there's freaking battlecruiser out We're going to need corruptors. It's just, it is what it is, you know? I've spoken with a lot of Zirks in my time, and I can't remember a single time where a Serk told me that it's a very wise idea to move across the map against double port battlecruiser with pure queens Now, I haven't discussed this scenario a lot either Maybe once or twice it came up But I don't think they ever said, hey, Kevin, you know what? I really do believe that marching across the map of creep with a queen count of what is this, 10, somewhere around 10, they do have 2-2 upgrades I've never heard of the 2-2-10 queen push against 4 battle cruisers. Because even though the upgrades sounds really cool, let's not forget that this is a tier one unit that costs two supply and there's 150 minerals while he's fighting against capital ships that cost 400 300 and have an ability that can delete one of the queens instantly so technically this is a six versus four fight because you get to delete four queens for free and then all of a sudden you're like hey wait a second this is freaking 24 supply of the of the of the of the of the of the of the taring capital ship And this is what? 12 supply of a tier one unit of the Zerk. And it's not even in its element, you know? It's off creep where it's worse because it can't kite, can't do anything Kind of predictably, the queen is going to lose this battle And the response here is actually going to go to be to go into hydras This just doesn't make a lot of sense You're losing your initial attack with pure queen And after your attack fails, you start moving out with the rest of your army There is actually another thing that is kind of interesting here and I kind of want to go back to this fight for that So this fight, even though it was not a good fight to take, took a very long time, an extremely long time. This fight took almost, what, 30, 35 seconds Imagine if this ground army was with it, not to attack the battle cruisers because links and roaches obviously can't attack battle cruisers, but just to clear anything on the ground, either, whether that's depots, SCVs, trying to deny some type of production That would have just been really helpful and maybe even kind of get the attention away from the queens Then the terror needs to make decisions Like, hey, do I defend my SCVs or do I kill the queens? And most of the times they're going to try to defend the SUVs In that case, your queens are still going to be useless because they're off creep But that's a story for another time. Hey, guys, quick intermission here to tell you the full story that just happened Some of you might have seen it on the mini-map He actually did push out with his whole army initially He had the Zirklings on the left side, he had his roaches and ravages on the right side, and the queens were kind of wandering around the rock or something, but then the unthinkable happened A single reaper poked into the third and started to attack the hatchery But of course, this was immediately answered with an F2 back home to deal with this insane threat. And since queens are not included in the F2 command, since it would kind of mess up all your macro cycles if you pulled all your queens away from your hatcheries, they were kind of left alone at the front to die That's the story Back to you, Kevin This fight takes a very long time I just don't think it was a good move Honestly, before this, I think the game looked pretty good During all of this, let's not forget, the Tern kind of SEVed up, worker up, droned up, SIVed up all the way to 60 So right now this started with a regular all-in Now it's like some type of super all-in And there's still no real answer to the battle cruisers. All of these are kind of soft answers to the battle cruisers Like they might deal with them if you have enough hydras and there's not enough PCs, but it's not really a counter like the corruptor is If you would introduce vipers in the mix or maybe even investors for neurons, I could kind of see it Once again, I'm being pretty generous to the Zerk here because I really do believe that corruptor is just the best answer Thrones are going on a trip to top side Not quite sure what they're going to be doing there Interesting Did he just kill a B C I killed two BCs already total Yeah, I can't really fight this properly It is quite tricky at least. Just kind of get kited And I think we've had this in a previous I-O-this as well, where I think back then it was with Voidrays, where the Void Race would just pop in between this area and this area And then the Hydras need to run around That's kind of what I mean The queens and the Hydras have a similar characteristic there where they can't really catch anything There's no catch on it, you know Even with stalkers, it's slightly better because you have blink Now, they accidentally do get one B C But it's still, yeah, it's still not great There's the infestation pit already, so I'm really surprised we're not seeing any higher tech, no high for potential vipers. Because in reality, this army still just kind of sucks I mean, it really does consist of four battle cruisers There's a lot of money in the bank for the Terran There's a decent amount of workers, but I actually believe with Vipers he would be capable of winning this I mean, there's still two-two upgrades against only plus one If you get in decent range where you can just pick them off one by one, I do believe that kind of should be fine The priorities of the Zurg lay somewhere else, though, and that's with these rocks The scouting has been just very mediocre as well the entire game through I mean, he's just not aware of anything. In his mind, I guess he's still being outproduced by Mass Battlecruiser, there's a couple of Thors on the way, which also incorrect out of the Terran Obviously, it should be Tanks If you're building Mass BC and your opponent is spamming ground units If you get five, six Tanks out, the game is just going to be absolutely over Now there's Banelings being morphed, and this is just kind of a nonsensical decision It's going to be to attack the Planetary Fortress, but you always kind of have to wonder what the goal is here. So we're just going to pass right at this moment, okay? So what actually is the goal right now for the Zirk player? You would say, if you look at this army, is to bust this planetary and then go back home This, however, only makes sense if you have a very large economy yourself, just an extremely large economy Because in that case, you can waste resources to destroy your opponent's economy, then take slightly inefficient trades, but because you're outmining your opponent so much, eventually their supply will keep going lower and lower while you stay maxed because, you know, you have so much money so you can reproduce the units quickly That is a valid Zirk strategy. In this case, however, we have an army and an eco that is not capable of doing that We have less workers, less bases than our opponent, and part of the workers have been idling over here Let's just kind of pay attention that he was too lazy to walk back home And instead, he just decided to build a new hatchery over here Rather than sending these drones home to just mine, he just built a hatchery here This is the type of panic thinking that I need in my life as well Absolutely beautiful stuff But yeah, this is an army that wants to win a single fight because he's completely all in. So what would be the correct call here is perhaps to not spend too many resources into blowing up this planetary, but circumventing the planetary by, and this is kind of a revolutionary concept, I understand that, by running around it, going towards the left side, just walking up this ramp That way you don't have to deal with the planetary and all this money can be spent in more hydras or whatever else you want If you're all-inning like this, it might actually be a wise call to also take the queens with you Because in this case, yeah, if the only thing that you really do care about is a single fight, go wild You have 22 larva at home anyway. Might as well start moving out I wouldn't have minded it at least It would have made life a little bit harder against this battle cruiser teleport, but at the same time it would have made this army a lot more tanky Good target fire here out of the Zirk takes out a lot of these Thor's basically immediately Not the greatest micro right now I would love to see a couple of spores being built There's a lot of spores in the main base All queens should kind of gather together as well Hydra should be rallied at home This is obviously a useless attack I can't believe this hatchery, by the way, is actually going to pay off Or well, if he starts mining from it. But technically, it could start paying off just because he panicked below It's all that makes me sad and happy at the same time Tours are still being blasted here The army is semi-split and also partially dead These Tours are going to survive The battle cruisers over here are just going What has he been doing for the past? I just want to go back for a second Just want to see what he was up to What is he looking at? So he's looking at his army He sees the roaches dying right now Doesn't pull back the roaches Instead just A-moves again with the Hydra Lisk He's one Hydra to attack the depot Now he starts targeting Okay. So all he's focusing on right now is this fight Now he goes over here, sees the Hydras There's actually something that I would like to tell you guys And I know that a lot of you probably don't know this yet Because I see this a lot in the replays But if you aim off the same spot 20 times, your units don't actually start attacking quicker Or if you right click a factory four times, they don't actually fight quicker Even if your camera is not on your units, they will still do the work, even when you're not looking I know for a lot of you middle management managers, this will be an absolutely insane concept that people do work when others. when others aren't watching, but the hydras will continue attacking the factory if you're not looking over them And that allows you to organize parts of your organization that actually do require some attention For example, like putting these hydras into a safe environment near the spores, or moving the spores from the main base into the natural or collecting all the queens together, sending them into the natural as well to defend that, or sending the drones that are currently not mining in the main base around going to your hidden base that you build in a moment of well brilliance and confusion and a mixture between the two But I'm glad you click the factory 12 more times made. I'm sure they had a big impact this game I'm not quite sure what I think of these hydras trying to target down as many SEVs as they could I actually do believe they might have been able to kill that Thor if they would have gone for it immediately But it's hard to say and we'll never know because I can't be bothered to figure it out These better cruisers are going to teleport back home And I think at this point we're going to see a ZERP that is on, as we call it, on some massive copium He's down to supply, sorry, 20 supply, two in worker supply He's fighting with six hydras against four battle cruisers. I'm not quite sure if he knows that there's three queens in the main base So I don't think so They have 200 energy after all In order to get 200 energy on a unit, you must not have touched it in the base past what, 20 minutes or so Heider's going to move across the map I still like the optimism, though You know, he has a hidden base Sometimes, what is it they say against? Ignorance is bliss And in this case, that's really true because he still believes he has a chance He's not aware whatsoever of this planetary here Probably due to the insane lack of scouting Walked into a couple of hellbeds The four battle cruisers kind of predictably loses everything. and now I'm just curious what's going to happen Our lone Hydra here, Han Rita Hydra, reporting back home to his superiors, telling what's happened And as he walks home, surely in the commander's office something has to be happening Well, nine more hydras on the way, because they've worked well Now, once again, I don't think this is actually winnable, but if this was winnable, why would Hydras be the way to the win? Okay? So far, every single fight you fought with Hydras, what has happened is that your Hydras died and you killed nothing Now you have less Hydras than before You have a worse Eco than your opponent. And you know he still has a bunch of battle cruisers, you're getting Halberts and Thor's again Investors This is such a good low eco tool If you can get three neurons off or four neurons off and you actually take over these battle cruisers Like I said, I still believe you're going to be losing I don't actually think you're winning the game But that is your only chance It really is just your only chance There's nothing else that there is that you can do, except for the investor Building more hydras obviously isn't the answer Now, perhaps once again, in your mind, it is the answer because you don't know your opponent is mining whatsoever. But even in that case, I wouldn't really mind the investment in In investment I'm also really surprised that you were just floating 800 minerals just now when absolutely nothing is happening and it's obvious that you need to spend every last mineral into units You start chasing this army of creep once again This is very frustrating to watch It's also frustrating that the Terran sometimes loses a battlecruiser, kind of giving you hope. That's actually what pisses me off more, I think, is that this Terran is your enabler, you know? he's not buying the cigarettes for you but he's basically buying them for you he's giving you the money and he knows that you're going to buy cigarettes for with it you know yeah this terran is the reason you're still smoking or well in this case getting your hydra smoked by helions battle cruisers and thor's it's really impressive by the way that you're not quite wondering where all these units are coming from every single time you pop your head in you see more units you go like ah probably just had a very big bank right there's no way he's mining from This base or this base. You probably was on three base the entire game, just like I was planning to be Because let's be real, that was your plan You took this as your third, and when that was under attack, you took this at your third When you believe that was going to die, you panic build this base No, actually, you build this base as like a semi-macro hatch So your drones had a place to stay Absolutely madman Yeah. Hey, did you just reinforce with links? 16 links you still have gas as well it wouldn't have mattered but it just doesn't make any sense why would the links help here it's obvious that the main threat is the battle cruiser shouldn't we be sometimes i actually think this is is completely hopeless It's like you guys aren't even listening I've been doing this for like, what, two years now? And every single week, I just get one of these replays And it's, look, I don't mind if your mechanics aren't great You can't click the buttons like 1,200 times a second But links against battle cruisers is just the sheer stupidity I don't understand it And no one can explain it to me either. And I'll ask them sometimes, and, you know, I'll ask these people like, What happened to you here? It's like, well, I don't know I don't think I was thinking It's like, yeah, I know I know you weren't thinking But then why do you send me this replay? If you weren't thinking Like, you can look at this I'd be so embarrassed if I did that It's like if I really wanted to become better at playing football, you know? And I have the, Cristiano Ronaldo has a show where you can upload a video You upload a video and you ask like, hey, I don't quite understand how to do this technique. And I want to be able to shoot a ball for more than 20 meters And I make a video of myself And as I start walking towards the ball, I poop myself and I slip And then I send him that video Like, what do you expect Ronaldo to say at that point? And I'm not saying I'm Ronaldo This is a hypothetical, of course Like, I just don't understand it Who are these people that send it? I would like to know you guys I'm just so curious who these people behind And then he leaves without Gigi as well As the battle cruisers find the hidden base Yeah I just don't know I really just don't know what to say about this type of stuff. It's just confusing to me It's obvious that, well, actually, I don't think you actually watch a lot of pro game But it's obviously you have some clue about StarCraft 2 You build upgrades and stuff You had queens Most Zerkes that know how to build queens kind of automatically get placed into diamonds so perhaps that's what happened to you as well you figured out that there's a Holt key for Queens and you build more than six and boom 3. 5K MMR and then from there and out I guess you just like your build order it was really bad okay if we're just going to go step by step your build order just just straight up sucked it really just sucked there's nothing else from me to say about it was that some two gas two queen opener double evo roach You did a creptone of damage with your roach attack It shouldn't have, but you did I'm like, okay I can live with that You did a lot of damage with that But everything about it still sucked Executioning, we're floating money, the idea behind it None of it made any sense It was no creeps spread either, even though nothing happened in the entire game. Your third base was insanely late You didn't scout a single time The only thing you saw were your opponent's two depots So you get surprised by the battlecruisers, naturally First you get surprised by the by the Benchie they didn't get surprised by the battle cruisers afterwards It's like the entire world is an entire surprise because you're living with your eyes closed And moving into the midgame, you know he has air units and PCs Your response is initially to walk across the map with the only anti-air defense that you have, the queen You march it across the map You lose four of them for free against Yamato Then you lose six of them for free because battle cruisers are better than queens. Yes, deal with it The battle cruiser is like five times as expensive It's three times more supply and you need to go to like tier five to get it as a terran yeah queens are supposed to lose that even if they don't have any upgrades on the battle cruisers that is completely fine then you followed up with hydras out of all the units that you could have built is hydras is like you watch the loco iotis with your ears and with your eyes closed and just open them halfway through you saw the hydra's like oh it seems fine let's go these loco built freaking corruptors with it at some point i much prefer the Hydra corruptor than just a pure Hydra here. You never tacked into a hive either, even though you definitely had the money for it You had the time for it as well And then you just continue pumping hydras, roaches And then as the cherry on top of the massive idiotic pie, you end with 16 links against a triple or four battle cruiser army It's like, I feel like there's absolutely no use for you to even watch this Because, yeah, there's no ability to learn, or there seems to be no ability to learn And that does sad on me a little bit The battle cruiser isn't imba, the mu isn't imba You just suck That's the way it is All right There's going to be it for me today. I'm going to need to go into a meditative state for the next four days I'm not quite sure if I will be uploading videos then, because this run really takes it all I can do this too much the heart rate goes too high, the blood pressure goes up So please, in the future, send me something a little bit better, you know? Send me like a picture of like something nice with it as well whenever you upload one of these IEO these forms Because this is getting too much for me Thanks so much for watching I hope you did enjoy it If you did, don't forget, hit the like button, subscribe to the channel. If you think you actually found something that is truly Imba, don't forget to upload it in the form below. Don't send me emails I do not open them. It says I owe this in the email. I don't look at it because they need to go to the form I don't want my email books cluttered with IO this is annoying. Yeah Smash like Bye."

        "text": "Dear Harstam, Lurkers are ridiculously imbalanced Two lurkers can hold off 30 supply of bio while the Zerk just makes a thousand drones In this game, my Reaper delays the third base of the Zerk for nearly a minute My double drop does not get a lot of damage, but I take a third base while deflecting a counterattack and do a doom drop that doesn't go great, but trades out a lot of units Then I macro up at home while being up two full upgrades the entire time I push again with 2-2 and 4 bases and decimate the Zerk army of Pure Hydra Viper I kill 51 workers and trade out my army, now up 14 workers and two upgrades. But my opponent has a trick that will counter all of that, a lurker then I, however, predicting this, start up ghost, cloak and liberators Over the next five minutes I kill five hatcheries and take favorable trades the entire time being up 50 to 70 supply the entire time By the 25 minute mark, I've killed 94 workers The Zerk just keeps making lurkers The Zerk decides to take into Ultralisks and attacks me, losing their entire army in the process I kill two more hatcheries, and what has to be the fourth Lurker then But as usual, the Zerk just throws down another Lurker then and continues to make Lurkers The Zerk drops two lurkers in my main, which I kill. I attack another hatchery in order to kill another lurker then and the lurker shred my army I try to escape with Metafax, but I lose too much The Zerk has too many units, and unlike the Zerk, I don't have an imbalance unit to counter the encroaching Zerk army I've killed over a hundred workers by this point But it doesn't matter I can't defend against this army Four lurkers can shred my specialized army of bio and ghost, but what would four liberators or tanks do? Die immediately or get a little abducted and die So tell me, Harsden, is the lurker imbalanced or do I suck? Name Paladin, race, Terran, leak, diamond and the server, North America All right, Paladin. Let's have a look at whether the lurker is imbalanced or whether you just suck Now, this is actually a very popular question and often it comes from ProDos players, but also very often and often the Often the more convincing arguments come from the terran in balance forms, I have to admit The lurker is just a very tricky unit to play against, as terran specifically, because your detection isn't quite as reliable Ravens are difficult to navigate They're not invisible unlike the observer They don't function well with the Terran army, which especially lower level terrans tend to use F2 in the Terran army a lot, making it difficult to control Ravens. And then the only real reliable way, of having detection everywhere tends to be the scan But in order to scan, you need a lot of command centers And in order to have a lot of command centers, you need a solid early game This is something that a lot of Terran struggle with because the early early game consists of Ling Bain stuff, getting up four or five extra CCs, turning them into orbitals, can be tricky These are all very good arguments However, once the ghost are out and the liberators are in position, lurkers just kind of fall off a cliff, honestly They become a lot worse, really just, a lot worse. Once you have snipe available, every single time that lurkers burrow and unburrow, three, four lurkers are going to die and lurkers aren't cheap They're very expensive units And it's really easy for the Terran to take super cost efficient trades Once you get the stable setup or you get some type of split map scenario, we've seen it many times out of Maru Once you get there, for a terran majority of the time, it's going to be fine However, I have a completely open mind to this If I truly believe that the lurker is too imbalanced, whether that is level related So at this level it is too hard or just in general too hard, then I mean, I'll need to change my opinion. I'm a man of science, you know I stick with my opinion until different evidence gets presented to me or until I die and then the guy that comes after me, you know, takes over my work Anyway, let's have a quick look here at this opening, this early game So we see single Reaper as a start into a reactor This is a very uncommon build This means this will be a barracks as a secondary building, but that barracks should have been built before the depot Building the barracks and the factory at the same time is not correct Second barracks before the depot is a mistake that a lot of people make I'm not going to complain too much about it. Good control so far on the Reaper as well I kind of do like that This also might actually get a drone here It does get a drone That's very solid, actually And maybe he can get a little bit more done with that Reaper I mean, forced an extractor here His opponent didn't build any links though It's kind of funny It's very rare I don't actually think, by the way, that the hatchery necessarily got delayed because of the Reaper So in his little form, he wrote that he delayed the hatchery because of the Reaper for an entire minute But honestly, the hatchery is delayed because the Zirk player was floating 700 minerals The Reaper went over here This is more of an accidental delay. delay This wasn't a minute either Maybe he can't count Okay, let's go back here Okay So the actual timing that the hatchery was going to go down was three minutes and one second And the actual timing it ends up going down is three minutes and 15 seconds That is a 15 second delay on the hatchery caused by the Reaper Sure, the hatchery is almost an entire minute late compared to what it usually is, but that was because of the Zerk's incompetence, not because of your brilliant Reaper So that is the first part of your imbalance form that I would deem to be, well, pretty untrue. What was it? You said exactly again, the Reaper delays the third base of the Zerk for nearly a minute So unless we're rounding up, I don't think this was a minute I would not recommend rounding up like that either It's going to get some weird timings in that case Yeah, you hit me His Pro Scout literally arrived at like, well actually I don't have a good joke here Never mind We'll scratch that The Reaper is gonna go find this circling In my head the joke was going to work and then I realized there really was nothing there I'll have something I'll make it up to you guys Oh, I understand it now. Paladin didn't watch the replay and he thought that this was the third base third base Well, that is actually the fourth base So later on he's going to scout this base, completely unaware of the fact that there's a third base over here already He's going to be real confused this game I can assure you that He's going to be real freaking confused These links are moving across the map, trying to get some scouting This is a 2-1-1, by the way Like I mentioned before, it's not the tightest 2-1-1 because of the late second barracks, but it looks kind of okay the third gas is, I think, slightly too fast as well No, he wants two extra meta-fax Yeah, that's not great. Okay, so this is the first drop that he does Now, his opponent took a very fast forward base, doesn't have any units, and has six queens, that's it If he unloads in time and stims his units, I think he should just basically get a free win here almost Or if he boosts into the main base, that might also be a possibility Let's take a look what's going to happen here will start shooting Quick response out of the Zirk, by the way Zirk also is pretty decent crew spread Okay, we get a drop Only drop with one METAVAC first Okay, this wasn't it That really wasn't it That was a very poor trait. So one of the concepts with the 2-1-1 is that the first timing with the two Mata-F-X is nice and often you can do something with it, especially at this lower level But it's most important to keep always your Marines alive because then when your combat shield finishes, which should have started a while ago already, and your third MEDAVAC arrives with six Marines and a mine or with eight Marines, you can really deal some big damage because there's only going to be slow bains, a couple of queens and links And you can definitely trade well here Now, the Terran did, he did talk about that. He said, my double drop does not get a lot of damage, but I take a third base while deflecting a counterattack Now, this is one of these things where the first part of the sentence does not connect whatsoever with the second part of the sentence It's like, imagine you work in a company and you're a salesperson And you go to your manager, go, Janice, I know I haven't made a single sale in the past 12 months, but did you see the freaking word art that I made for the financial report of quarter one in 2018? like Janice will just look at you like you're a complete idiot because if you're not getting any sales that is the thing that truly matters here initially. The second part, good job that you're doing that correctly but we're criticizing you on part one here Your drop did nothing and even worse than doing nothing You wanted it to do something and you sacrificed Marines for it And because of that, the most powerful part of your build, which is when the third MataVec arrives with the combat shield, is not going to be able to do anything And at this point, your build is completely pointless You just ruined your own build order And the worst part is that you're not even aware of it yet, because in your mind, you deflected a counterattack and got a third pace at the same time So then all of a sudden it's fine. This doesn't make any sense whatsoever It really is very illogical It's also a weird wall, by the way It's like you played snake too much growing up as a kid And now you always have to make shapes in, kind of like a weird snake Very sharp turn there on the snake Bit too sharp It's not possible All right What's your follow-up going to be? Armory You have these double e-base Third barracks before the third CC This is the incorrect call as well Usually you should be getting that third CC before Because otherwise, the longer you delay your third CC, the more all-in you're going to get And That tends to be a bad thing if you're playing as a Zerk. Now the Zerk, this is very good by the way I'm really surprised His crew thread is quite nice He moved his queens very quickly as well His droning, sure, isn't the fastest, but he knows what to do Like I really like the way this guy is playing I feel like this is the second trip this SCV made See, oh, there's still poop over here Let me just build the third CC on the other side, I guess Yeah, that's what he's gonna do I'm not a huge fan generally of building the CC on position against Zirk because often a single link or three or four links or ten links can cancel that. I much prefer having it over here and you can just flow that down What is this? Sir, we finish the wall Perfect, soldier Now send all of the women and children outside What? Like this makes absolutely no sense You build a wall, either you build a CC in the wall, so there's less surface area, or you build it on the high ground over here The worst part is, at flying from this point is further than flying it from over here So not only are you exposing it to danger, it's also just quite frankly worse But this is the doom drop that Paladin refers to And as he said, he said he traded this out. He said I didn't do a lot of damage, but I traded out a lot of units So I'm very curious to see what that means kind of, you know, more in a more substantial way Okay Trading out units I wish I had a pen here I would have written it down in my notebook Trading out units Losing everything to four bailings That's great Next time I go to the casino, I'll tell my girlfriend that I traded out 500 bucks as well to the casino Yep, we're going to have water for dinner for the next three weeks or we're not making rent See how she responds to that There's absolutely no way this was good. Your opponent held this while being up 30 workers, by the way, or something like that I think he had 78, 75 workers Now still 71 It's already on four bases, taking a fifth base as you're trying to land your third This is still not an orbital either So, honestly, you're in quite a bad spot You haven't cleaned creep once Maybe Not a single creep tumor has gone down Not one In a nine minute game Then you know that something is wrong for the Terran You haven't really killed much in general. Like, you went for an extremely aggressive build with the 2-1-1, delayed your third CC for an extra barracks, and so far the units lost is exactly even, and your opponent is up 32 workers Yeah, this has not been a successful expedition so far Let me tell you that much Lurker then being thrown down at the 9th minute mark, hive going down, triple Evo chamber This circus playing really, really, really well His creep spread is very solid I think he's quite fast as well, yeah This circuit is at 250 apm for a dime It's not bad Like, his macro is slipping at times, and the injects aren't brilliant But nothing that can be fixed with a couple of macro hatches, of course. So you see one macro hatch going down here and macro hatch on the far right side Macro hatch in the natural as well All that looks kind of good You're just kind of sitting back You're not even sending out single marine drops either Like you could just send a single marine drop, start clearing some creep here I'm actually not quite sure what you're paying attention to It seems to me like you're not doing much of anything at this point And it is difficult to believe for me that you at this point think that you did so much damage that you can just sit back and wait for your opponent to all in into you. It's obvious that that's not the case, right? You did no damage whatsoever Even you stated that in your form is that you just didn't do a lot so far The only bragging that you've done in your form was that you deflected a counterattack and that you managed to build a third base Well, building a third base is just clicking the B and the C button for a second time So you build a What are these guys doing? Are they at a dancing party? What is this? Oh, see that again? Come Come Very cool Very, very cool I didn't know this was possible Do you think he's clicking this to do it like that? Oh, he's chasing the Karak He's dancing around the Karak. And whenever the Corruptor tries to move Oh, I've never seen that before That actually was quite nice I do really enjoy that What do we have as a follow-up? What do we have as a follow-up here? Vipers coming in So this is the Hydra Vipers stage Now, the five aggressive Evo chambers? Serral He's loving it, man The aggressive five Evo chambers for the, so that the Vipers can start getting some energy from here It's actually quite important, usually I do like that I really do like that a lot Solid moves Solid moves Still not doing much of anything I think you cleared two Creep Tumors so far Yeah Two Creep Tumors have gone down in a 12-minute game. You went into eight racks as well And double factory So this is, you're basically setting up for a three-base all-in here, 12 minutes into a game while your opponent is attacking you with Hydra Viper It had an absolutely insane timing that you're managing to hit here Fly the liberators forward as well into your opponent's army You're actually, it's so obvious that you're Oh no, poor Zerk No bailings in his army means this is going to move through I was going to say it's really obvious that you're using F2 so much as well Because every time you have the Liberators not in siege position, they just move command into your opponent's hydras It's quite sad to watch. This is a great run-by if it would be going into the natural or if there was a Ford base to attack, but sadly that's not the case Set up these Liberators I mean, I think I. this point I think at this point the if the Zirka attacks into you with the bailings he should still be fine but yeah he attacks with the Hydros first now it's going to be kind of difficult I also like that you completely gave up on cleaning up the creep as well hey did one more scan kind of how do you see that again where you how many creep shooters you killed yeah 13 creep tremors have been lost so far you're completely deep into the creep I had a friend that had a similar approach to what you have with creep, but he had it with personal hygiene So he almost, he always smelled quite bad and never really showered. And he said, Kevin, at this point, if I were to shower, I would need to clean so much And it would take such a long time that I almost think it's not worth the effort anymore And I feel like it's the same kind of thinking that you're using here Like there's so much creep that you feel like it's no point anymore But I think that theory kind of stinks I would not suggest that Just even if it's too late, you can still make something of this game Just start by clearing the active tumors, that type of stuff Now, you're dealing a lot of damage with this Ooh, I'd love that as well Good stuff. Making sure that the three banings can clear five mines at the same time Possibly the only way you can still lose You're up 40 supply currently against a player without any real splash damage, except a couple of banings You have 13 mines This should be theoretically impossible to lose at this point I actually do believe this is impossible impossible to lose Oh, here come the bains I was talking about Look at that Now, he required three bains and a couple of hydras to clear five mines Maybe stimmed two more times to get your army nice and quick into the red one Another stim There we go Beautiful Now one more And we're exactly where we want to be Two bailings in this army. I like that this man knows exactly where the priority lays There's two bailings total and he thinks it's more important The first target down the lurker then, rather than hitting the bailing that could one-shot this entire army Very cool These Marines have never seen battle, but they've already overdosed on opioids multiple times Very cool as well Ten Marines left Okay This has actually been one, if you don't manage to win this again, it's actually one of the biggest throws I've seen in my life The Zerk somehow led you in because he thought that you probably had a fort base. He built five Evo chambers aggressively into a three-base all-in, while he himself was on six bases, getting triple upgrades in the main base, tacking into lurkers If he had five banlings while he was defending, you would have died already You don't deserve to be in this game anymore You're in this game because the Zerk thought that you would have a fourth base, and perhaps even a fifth already as well The reason why you're in this game is a complete misunderstanding Okay? It's not okay It's absolutely not okay Seismic spine Uh, okay, I like that So Lurker upgrades coming in right now. And I guess this is where the game starts going poor for you, which is once again difficult to imagine that things are possible to go poor from this point on You have 30 Marines, six marauders Your opponent has 11 hydras If you would attack at this point, I think even with your eyes closed, you'd be able to win and without using Stim Now, this changes once the Lurker comes out, which means that you'll need to switch up. this the current play style because so far it looks like you have been playing especially in the fights with your eyes closed and i guess not without stim because you've been stimming a little bit too much but if you just actually move across the map i don't think there's any way that you lose now there's another trick and this is a an advanced concept so if you're below diamond just close your ears But this is that you can split your army into multiple groups So imagine your opponent has one base well fortified with tanks or lurkers, siege units, or with a planetary fortress or cannons, that type of stuff. You can with the other half of your army try to poke holes on the other side You don't always need to have your entire army in a giant ball. Now this is kind of confusing for people and I understand that this can be confusing for you as well but just try it you just split the metaphax in half you split the infantry in half and you send one half to this side and the other half you don't even really need to use you don't need to use them at the same time just have them split and then you micro one half of your army and the other half is just defending if you see your opponent's army arriving where your half of the army is, you move that army back and you go forward with the other half of your army. That way you only need to control one half of your army at a time, but you're still forcing your opponent to split as well And defensive split in often is harder than aggressive splitting Now here a couple of lurkers are attacking your orbital command Now this fight only took 15 seconds So I completely understand why you decided not to lift this command center It probably went a bit too fast for you there It's like not sure whether to lift or whether to, you know, let it sit there and tank three damage from the lurkers It's not like it was a planetary It was a command center There would have been no downside whatsoever to, yeah, to taking it out. But instead, I think you decided to take out some rocks during that moment But it's completely fine because you have plenty of money to spend, right? Right Also, that commands center definitely wasn't important because you're running out of minerals Right Right Yeah, a little bit painful Also lacking a complete lack of scans You're losing this base as you're kind of caught out of position To be fair, the Zurg also caught me out of position I didn't see this coming Now, there is a trick here, which is the sensor tower, which basically provides you with free map hack It sees any unit that is moving towards you. it gives a little exclamation mark it's absolutely great I also want to just I want to check something real fast from your thing over the next five minutes I kill five hatcheries and take favorable trades the entire time being up 50 to 70 supply the entire time I'm not sure if this is this time but you have been up for 50 to 70 supply for the past three minutes already you just haven't used that advantage okay it makes absolutely no sense this is like if the US had won the space race against Russia or well they would have been they they built the first rocket that could go to the moon like five years before them but rather than actually getting it to the moon they decided to just leave it on the ground for another 12 years that's kind of what happened in the past three minutes okay you had the win all you needed to do was actually go to the moon or in this case move to the other side of the map how many mines 12 mines another quick tip here is that mines aren't as useful anymore against lurkers often. You can use them to mainly against stuff like run bys and to hold chokes, you know, or well, hold choke As a surprise in a choke, like 20 links go by or lurkers Don't do that, please Oh, he doesn't have a separate control group for Ghost, does he? I'm not sure if he has a separate control group for them or not Oh? He scans forward, sees that there's an overseer, decides to go in, two snipes go off, and he loses all of his energy on the ghost This is the type of decision-making that I tune in for my friends. Now he realizes, wait a second, if he has all of his lurkers over here, maybe there's nothing somewhere else at the same time getting run by If he doesn't live this base, thank the Lord, if he would have lost another command center at the fifth to a no anti-air run by, I would have been extremely upset Now, the same concept from earlier, by the way, still counts You're still allowed to split up your army, especially just a part of the bio at this point, with three meta facts You put a mine over here, mine over here, mine over here, and you start clearing creep with the bio army You use the ghost defensively for when lurkers try to move in. You can snip them You have a very nice ghost count You have 19 ghosts against four lurkers I'm not even quite sure how you're not just straight up killing him Like, you can literally scan, queue up 35 snip And if your snipes doesn't go off, you actually get the energy back This is one of the craziest things in all of Stark It's just EMP a lurker? Like, that EMP was so late I think I actually hit a viper, but I'm not even sure if that could be considered an EMP targeted at the viper Okay, you just killed every single lurker You didn't even snip them Stim? Blinding clouds? Okay Snipes? Snipes? No, not necessary So you win this fight again. a complete free win of a fight problem is this these seven links have actually destroyed everything at your home but once again this was a very good fight every fight by the way or in general most fights have been very favourable for the terran I just really like to point that out that the terran was complaining about the fact that lurkers were too strong but so far not a single fight with lurkers was actually that bad unless you count walking 30 Marines into four lurkers, but that wasn't a fight He just accidentally walked into a lurker That's like saying that magma is too strong because your neighbor walked into a volcano accident It's like, I'm not quite sure if we'd count that Nice. Yeah, another very fruitful fight And for the second time this game, your absolute light years ahead because your opponent doesn't have any larva You do take out another lurker then, very nice Spawning pool gets taken out as well And now what's very important is the speed at which you do things So you want to be killing either buildings or drones, just making sure that you're really pushing your lead You know, last time I think you took quite a while at times to get things going At the same time, you can also, of course, increase your own position of power in this game. By, for example, rather than having 33 workers at one base, you can split the workers up, half over here, half on the other base Nice to imp It actually was a good EMP It had like two, three of the vipers Stim forward Might want to use snipes It is allowed It is allowed to use snipes against things that aren't lurkers either With a sniper, you can clear the hydras real fast You can trust me on that You can also kill vipers with it Resources lost Terran is up 16K Well, the bigger number is with the Zerk By about 16,000 It's a big deal It's a very big deal 1 23 supply against 96. For some weird reason, Paladin still isn't mining more than his opponent Well, it's not a weird reason It's because he's mining with 33 workers currently at four mineral patches He still has this base completely open He has an orbital in the main that he can lift to this base So there's a lot of options But needless to say, he's very busy controlling this army Still not clearing creep, by the way It's been on the map for the past five minutes He has cleared 61 at this point in total So a little bit more than earlier He started the cleaning process I wonder if he's ever going to snipe any hydras or if he just doesn't believe in it That's also possible. Drops the mules He is aware that he has a base over here Drops the mules there, but decides to not use anything else You would reckon that if someone is so keen on not doing any macro or any good economic actions that he would have very good micro or at least would be focusing his entire attention on the micro but instead he's just chasing a laser like he's a cat over there Look at these hydras These hydras are just baiting him to chase him On the creep Look at this This Zirk is I don't understand why the Zerk is losing so hard, by the way It feels like the Zerk has been outplaying the terror in the entire game. There were a lot of bad fights Well, I guess it was just a couple of times This is the sickest run by I've seen in my life That's actually really cool Now we see some snipes Okay, solid stuff I guess the first fight was really bad for the Zerker and after that there just wasn't enough lurkers But the ghost, honestly, I've been training so well I find it very weird that a Terran dares complaining after having this type of traits the entire time Okay, this is the point I guess he was talking about So right now, we're actually in a position. Just let's take in this information, okay? We currently have a Terran that should be outmining his opponent if he properly saturates these bases who has 12 ghost which can snipe, basically any Zirk units, multiple times There's four metaphics, 34 Marines and four marauders And the Zerk has a single viper without energy, two links, zero queens, and two lurkers in production Now, I think you'd actually need to try to lose this game I really do believe that if you would blindly aim off across the map, and you'd have a raven with this army, I think you would actually win Your planetary is safe, you're mining from there for a while longer. If you just ice closed and you move on the map a couple of times, I think you could go, you know, make dinner for the night You'd come back in 12 minutes and you'd see the victory screen I am impressed that it isn't quite happening Okay, there's no base over here. hasn't scouted this base yet knows that there was a base over here at some point most of the time that also means that there's a base here but he hasn't quite discovered it yet in the fog of war. Okay two Lurkers get taken out pretty efficient trade i don't think he lost too much there there's also no why's he going to the main and he cleared all the tech in the main like five years ago already. I guess he can go again take out the Hive Ultralisk Cavern Hydra Den guess it's not too bad. Still feel like this should be absolutely impossible to lose. He's up 60 supply. Okay There's four Lurkers here The reinforcements are getting taken out. Good scan here. Very nice scan He sees that the lurkers are there after losing eight units He's like, oh, okay, let me just scan now This is actually controlling the unit as well, okay? Okay The Lurker has an attack that goes in a line So unlike with most weapons, if you're standing behind someone and, you know, the person in front of you get shot, you're kind of safe behind that person with the lurker that is very different The lurker actually attacks in a line and it doesn't get stopped by the first person So rather than moving into it in a line, what you want to do is you want to spread out your units In StarCraft 2 we call that a concave. I'd want your units to be in a concave That way, you wouldn't lose, well, what is this? Six ghost, four or five marauders and a bunch of marines to four lurkers Oh my God, that last shot Okay, you lost like 15 Marines or 20 Marines maybe even to four lurkers Yeah, with this type of trading, these four lurkers are going to be really scary Luckily, they're split up So if at some point you decide to finally clear this base, you might actually be fine Also, you're still mining from the same four patches that you have been since minute 19 Now we see a lift on the orbital, absolutely beautiful Start sending it over here Okay, I like that move a lot. I think that's genuinely a good move I don't understand how it's possible that if all you're doing is paying attention to your army, that you lose a ghost to two hydras Can't you pull it back if you see it's getting killed? Overlord's going to get pushed back here a little bit as well Still have this base mining I don't think he's in He must be wondering right now what's going on It's like, why am I? Why is he not getting revealed? Is it possible that perhaps this piece of fog of war that I haven't seen yet, that there's a base over there? Might that just be the case? Yes, that might just be the case That actually might just be the case. These minds, I think, just managed to kill a lurker, by the way, maybe even two lurkers Very cool Currently, there is three lurkers, two hydras, two links against six Ghost, six Metavax, eight ghosts, six Metafax and five marauders Now, just with snipes alone, you will win this fight percent of time Why would you scan? What? You have a single orbital command and you scan an area Why wouldn't you just send a single marine to check first? This makes no sense Now a Raven is actually a very good call, by the way, because you're out of, oh, you have a second orbital as well Is he not in a hurry? What are you even doing? Okay, the single marine is checking over here. There's a base here again I wonder if he's mining anywhere else It is just impressive I really find it, I just don't understand Like, what are you doing at this point? Is he looking for lurkers underground or something? Okay, send one unit forward Don't scan Don't scan ahead of you Just send one unit forward Or wait for the raven Okay, solid Good Here we go Okay, base gets taken out This Zirk is quite quick, by the way You just pulled away the workers in time, I think Yeah Very cool This jerk has so many good moves, but yet he's losing Very interesting This is a bunch of money in the bank now at least Okay, so this base gets taken out. Now, surely we can't break this, right? Hello? Nine ghost Three lurkers Five lurkers Six Marauders Five Ultras Ultras might be a bit of an issue at this point There's no Kytinus plating yet though So, and no anabolic synthesis So these Ultras aren't going to be brilliant Watch this army F2 into this, by the way Still at this point, this base completely unscouted Okay, here we go Snipe, snipe, snipe, snipe, snipe, just sniping, snipe from a distance If you queue up six snipes on these lurkers, you'll get it Come on He also knows that there's a base over here, by the way Once again, this concept called splitting the army could be of major user. Just sending a double drop towards this side with like three marauders and like 10 Marines and two medevacs would be fantastic Allows you to defend this middle area so you don't have to be afraid of dying And also allows you to keep pressure on two sides at the same time With that army, you would be capable of killing anything here on the right side, except maybe four lurkers, because I've seen how you micro against four lurkers This army is moving out You're at home Oh, actually respond in time Second Raven is out as well I like it Actually, don't mind the second raven here Ghost snipes, more snipes, more snipes We need more snipes. He moved commands his entire army into it while sniping Oh man, one day someone's going to explain them about using a second control group Look at this! This actually was way better of a fight Just uses snipe from a distance, still loses four ghosts, doesn't stim, because the ghost is in front of the marina marauder You need to use the tab here He actually hasn't stimmed ever since he built ghosts Now he stims because the ghosts weren't in his control group yet This is absolutely fantastic It is difficult to believe that this is an actual person playing It really is These ravens, auto turrets, I like that. Why is he controlling these ravens so well? But why can't he control the ghost just as well? Like he was moving it back, microwing it away from the spore I really did not expect No, not what? No, don't throw down every single turret you have It was a single spine You can use these later on Okay, we agree I think theoretically we're still winning Now of course, if we would have stopped this base from mining it any, this base base, I'd just like to show you guys This base, according to the Terran, doesn't exist yet, but in reality has been completely mined out I didn't even know it was possible to be this unaware of anything It is very impressive Really, really impressive. One day I hope to achieve this level of ignorance of the world around me Life must be so easy Holy crap Okay, these orbital commands have a bunch of energy So even if these ravens go down, we still have a chance Our ghost count once again is up to five, but now the lurker count is actually rising This is scary Okay Yeah, nice in a line, very smart Good, yeah, clamp them up Solid Run out of the scan Very annoying Okay, here comes the scan Oh! I tell you, this Zerk is actually pretty sick The circus is really quite fast Oh, and how many kills does this lurker still get? This was a lone lurker. How can a lone lurker get 13 kills? I don't even understand how that's possible You could have just sniped it with three ghosts and it would have been fine again Maybe he doesn't have a hotkey for a snipe and he needs to click it with the mouse They would explain the speed of him I feel like it's the fourth hive that we're seeing Okay, the third hive How many lurker then says he lost? He lost four lurker dens as well Is he going to rebuild it? No, still he already has one This is the fifth lurker than, the fifth higher than? How many M-station pits? Oh, he only lost one God Honestly, he should have built every building here. This Terra never would have found it This is the one piece of the map he doesn't want to go to He's heard stories about it Rumor on the street is that there's millions of lurkers waiting for you there So I won't go Oh, two lurkers, two lurkers? Why build the Ravens? if you're not going to use them for the detection I mean, he clears it, but even that wasn't too efficient, you know? This type of fight, okay, okay, okay, here, we completely oversee the situation of what is here, okay? This is super clear what is going on Now, we have multiple solutions to this problem. The first solution to this problem would be, I was going to say maybe you can cloak because there's nothing there, but there might not be the case The first solution, which would be the easiest, is you see this lurker is exposed, so you just snip it from the high ground That is your first lurker The second lurker also is in a great spot You can also snip it Then you can move part of your army behind this mineral line, forcing the lurkers to unburrow Once that happens, we snip those as well Okay? That is the game plan as I see it Now let's take a look at what Paladin has for a game plan Okay. Snipes, the lurker from the high ground gets it The hydras show up We lose all the ravens And we lose the rest Not entirely the same as I had imagined it There are also no mines with this army It might have been helpful, these five mines, stopping this type of move Yeah Um, good lord Well, there was actually a very painful end I'm not even sure if he was 100% dead over here Ah, he was losing the mules Still feel like it's playable, no? Two orbitals If you can get it I mean, theoretically it would have been playable We know that Pallelin wouldn't have won it, especially not after that load up All right. That's just, I'm just going to have to look at your crap a little bit again He said the Zerk has too many units And unlike the Zerk, I don't have an imbalance unit to counter the encrouching Zerk army You actually have a siege unit It's called a siege tank The word siege is in the name of the unit It helps massively at defending against encroaching Zerk armies It helps massively holding positions aggressively It helps massively covering for your ghost as well You have a liberate Have you even built liberators? Oh, you build liberators in the midgame, but you kept just move commanding them into your opponent's army straight up So it doesn't really count. The only unit that you actually built, that was the counter to the lurker, was the ghost, but you just continuously move commanding them with your bio army as well Your snipes were kind of late I actually felt like you absolutely had this game as well, which makes it even worse Like, the unit lost in the end is still 13K in your favor You just got completely outmined by this one bottom right side base, which you never saw So really to kind of summarize it, your micro was absolutely terrible You have a control group, which you always use, either F2 or a single control group Whenever there's ghost in your army, you can't stim. Whenever you have liberators, they fly into your opponent's hydra force because you can't push them back Only when they're sieged up are the units not move commanding into your opponent's army You lost an entire army close to your fifth base, or what was once your fifth base, trying to move into a lurker position That was absolutely terrible as well Yeah, the no stimming So for the micro, you get a big fat thumbs down. for your army composition well no tanks whatsoever you had liberators did you have lip range though no you didn't have liber range either technically it's possible to play with the army comp that you did but not with your micro so for you I'd say the army comp is fine but in the future I'd recommend tanks and more liberators units that siege up so you don't really have to control them anymore once they're siegeed up they can fire automatically that's probably why you enjoy building widow mines as much as well now for the final one is your in-game decision-making and your army splits, which were absolutely non-existent You always had a massive ball of an army You never once multitasked. You did two drops at the start, but you only did that because your entire army could fit in the drops You never multitasked You never had a secondary attack going Always came from one side Your rotations were extremely obvious You put it all together, and I think it's pretty clear that the lurker isn't the problem but your mediocre brain and execution are And thus, my friend, it is you who sucks And not the lurker that is imbalanced All right That's going to be it for today's episode of Is it Inba or Do I Suck? I hope you did enjoy this relatively long episode Thanks all so much for watching Be sure to send in your own IOLDIS forums from the description down below. Use the Google sheet that we have attached to it Hopefully I'll see all of you for a new video Thank you And bye-bye Thank you."

        "text": "Dear Harstam, minds are so broken They aren't unbeatable, but they are imba This game is a prime showcase for that In the early game, I get Dark Templars out and crush his first push while terrorizing his SEVs Eventually, he cleans that up, and then I put some pressure on with blink stalkers It's not the greatest of moves, but since I'm already had, I'd say it was a net win He counterattacks, and again, it goes overwhelmingly in my favor I stay up in economy, the whole game Nevertheless, he easily destroys entire swats of my army once he gets a big amount of mines. He snipes my detection, so then my army is forced to just walk over mines while he sits safely across the map with his real army I run my army into the mine grinder twice Before, that's all he needs to just marshaled cross and sloppily aim move all over the place My favorite part about mines is that if they notice you're killing, their mines A simple scan means that now the mines will auto-target a detection And then the Protos army just marches forward because AI forgets they saw landmines there two seconds ago Now, this is kind of funny Turnup the base here says that this is his favorite part about the mines, but I believe he's using something called sarcasm. He doesn't actually believe that this is his favorite part I actually believe this is his least favorite part about the mines Because otherwise it just doesn't make a lot of sense Anyway, let's continue Please view this Give it the imba stamp it deserves Then join me in petitioning Blizzard to put one last patch banning mines Thank you for your time Name Turn up the base Race Protos Leak, Diamond, MMR, 36, A2 And the server is North America All right Let's have a look and what our good friend Turnup the base actually performs here What type of tricks he's up to He opens up with a 12 pylon here or he's forgetting his first worker That's two options Okay, he starts a worker. Okay, he gets, well, he ends up getting a 12 pylon while floating 150 minerals That means he might as well have gotten a 13 pylon because a probe costs 50 minerals and thus it didn't delay the pylon at all here So basically we're viewing this right now as a 13 pylon experience, which means a 13, 14 gate is what is necessary And we'll need an immediate chronobo boost here to make sure that we boost that eco where we want it to be You're going to need to use that on the probes or if you want a zealot before the first adapt I guess you could use it on the zealot, but that is extremely uncommon And that completely destroys your economy. So I would not recommend it It would delay your nexus It would force you to get a second pylon before nexus all of these things which tend to not be great Triple in gas as well Okay, so he wants to follow this up with a very heavy gas type of build order And there's no second gas, so it can't really be a proxy void ray There's also no scout And he chrono boosts once he nears the end of his pro production That makes absolutely no sense That's like buying Tinder premium after you got a girlfriend It's like, hello? What's the point? Nexus goes down. He just sat there for like seven, eight seconds or so, with the chronobust going on the Nexus and nothing happening Not a very good move Not a very good move He has the eco as well of a 12 pylon, but he has the timing on the adapt of a 13 pylon So there's about a four seconds and waste here that we're never going to get back Pulls three workers to kill this SUV Doesn't get it Nice That's the type of investment I like to see So what I'm trying to say is that there's been a heavy investment here in this extremely quick adapt that now definitely needs to try and do something on the other side of the map. We have this Command Center going up It can't be denied, I think, because this was a Reactor first, which probably is the best build order possible against what Turnup the Base is playing But Turnup the Base hasn't scouted and keeps his first Adept at home Now, this is complete nonsense, okay? If you play a 12 Pylon 13 Gateway or a 13 Pylon 14 Gateway, your Adept is so fast that it is there before the Reaper arrives Okay? There's absolutely no point in getting that first Adept to stay defensive You need to move it across the map You just cut like 120, 130 minerals into your build that you're never getting back This Adept needs to achieve something. This is basically like buying a bulletproof vest before the gun is invented It makes no sense to use this defensively You need to move across the map, get something done That's the entire point of the build Just that first adept being capable of canceling that CC temporarily or dealing some damage I've seen this build being used with a stalker first where people move across the map with the first stalker and then try to kite Marines In that case, against the reactor first, it could still be kind of viable But like this, it makes absolutely no sense He's now going to try to hit a tight three adept timing He's hitting at three minutes and 35 seconds Like, this should do absolutely nothing. If this does anything, it is due to his opponent's incompetence and not due to his own brilliant build order So he ends up killing two Marines, loses an adept That is a good trade for a terran, usually As long as there's no Oracle follow-up, this is a type of trait that you'd be completely down with as a terran Taryn is playing a three wrecks and he's playing a relatively decent version There's too many depots though And because of that has a slightly lower marine count than he probably should Also forgot to actually research the combat in time Actually, his stim is really fast There's something funky going on there, but I won't complain about the Tarrant too much. Do not worry about that fellers I will not complain about it too much Okay, so we have a triple adapt into DT drop Now, this is a build that I've seen Zest do a lot Zest played this with a 12 pylon as well, except Zest then would do some damage with that initial depth rather than losing two adepts to 12 Marines At this point, turn up the base is, of course, very aware of what's going on, and because of that also ends up building two batteries I think that is the correct call, and I like seeing that I think that generally is quite good. It's annoying that there's no wall, because even though these batteries are very useful, right now, there is a possibility that if the 10, Terran makes the correct decision and ignores your units and the pilot and just starts killing your workers, that Protos is in an absolutely terrible position Protos would just straight up die I mean, it was 15 Marines You can clear infinite workers by just stimming a couple of times Like you stim once, then once the stim runs out, you stim a second time I think you'll kill like 18, 19 workers with your Marines Instead, the Terran here, well, he's going to head back home and try to defend this Honestly, it's not even taking too much damage against the DTs. kind of impressed by his response at home Just not too fond of how the Terran did this in the offense Another DT is being warped in, but gets cancelled And so far, like, the build order, honestly, the follow-up wasn't too bad I like some of the response of Turnup the Base But he should have been dead already if the Terran had properly focused these workers It's not quite the case Turnup the base loses a bunch of DTs for no real reason, straight into turrets But then again, he's also doing a fair amount of damage, so perhaps it's not even in the end of the world yet More DTs now walking into turret range It's absolutely right. I feel like all of the damage he did was just with like one or two DTs that just dodged the units And the moment he started controlling the DTs, they just ended up dying I believe sometimes at lower levels, it's just better to not control your harassment units whatsoever Just kind of aim within the main base because I often see this type of stuff where Protos players, by controlling their units, actually make it work like trying to chase units rather than just aim moving and killing a refinery and five workers, which honestly would have been a better deal here Anyway, let's have a look at the follow-up here. The follow-up was floating a crappton of resources, throwing down two extra gateways, added on to the already four that we have, not getting any forges and getting a robo bay at six minutes and 50 seconds This is all relatively late and non-tight build orders, but because he dealt a fair amount of damage, I think I'm going to be fine with it I'm losing 60 T's very gas-intensive It's just very difficult often to make things work after such a start, even if you kill or actually only killed four workers Yeah, I don't actually really I don't really like the start for the Protos, but I like the start for the Terran even less Like both players so far, not impressing me massively. Nice little control there out of the Taryn taking out three stalkers That was cool I do enjoy that Concussive shells also being researched right now so that can come into play a bit later Second eBay as well as an armory being thrown down Huge fan of these buildings, getting those upgrades rolling The same time Turnup the Base has pretty much full vision of his opponent, knowing when he will move out For whatever reason, it's still only producing stalkers No sentries are being added, no zealots First Colossi is now in production It's not being Chrono Boost You'd figure, that if all you have is stalkers, is that you would get, well, some type of feeling of urgency to get that colossus out. Turnup the base doesn't really seem to have that type of feeling of urgency One thing I'd really want to complement Turnup the Basin, though, is his map vision He has these observers well spread out I wouldn't mind having a unit or a pylon here He also has a prism here I'm not quite sure if this is meant to be a spotter or if he just forgot that he has a prism and it's just floating on the map Now, having map vision is one thing, but using that map vision, of course, is a second We're going to see if he will end up using that in this game Stateran is finally kind of gearing up for that first push. You know, it's getting ready with these two MED effects Maybe with Madafect 3 and 4, he'll start going Or maybe turn up the base decides to go Of course, a cool thing that you can do with Stalkers is you can always kite your opponent's units kind of back and I'm not quite sure if this is what turn up the base is doing here It feels more like a straight-up attack on the third base, which also is fun, but Yeah, I want to see that blink again Let's just check that blink out again. So, first of all, I think if you're in a situation where you have a fully saturated third base and you're getting your fourth base, the priority is not in denying your opponent's third The priority is in not dying right in that moment If you do not die for the next 25 seconds, you're genuinely really far ahead I think it's going to be difficult to die That said, if you're going to make a mass attack with blink stalkers, at least keep your colossi at home, because that's a unit that will be very useful defensively in combination with a battery You can maybe do like some semi-based tradey stuff, keep your opponent busy with these stalkers would be very useful. Now, then the second part of this, if we forget about all of that This is a move that I haven't seen very often He targets down the CC, okay? Then in his vision, he has full vision still, he sees a Marine, three Marines and a marauder This CC is probably within sniping range right now, if he just continues killing it He blinks forward to the left to snipe a marauder that came from the natural This is like selling your car because you forgot where you put your shoes It just doesn't make a whole lot of sense The marauders do end up falling The CC, however, survives And these blink stalkers are, well, actually, I think they can just kind of fight this. This is another case where perhaps an A move would have been better than, oh my God, then going for the straight up target fire there at the start because he was completely overkilling one or two Marines Well, he probably could have just straight up won the game It's not going to get hit by any of these mines He did just see those four mines burrow That's kind of important because now he knows that these mines are there He can get an observer, or well, there's an observer over here He can use that to clear all these mines, and he should be pretty fine Oh, good blink forward Sadly, misses a shot And as a result, well, you got a good trade. So Tos is pretty far ahead at this point, right? Ford base is there, you're up 20 workers There's absolutely zero need to go into the natural right now You can, however, kite this army for quite some time with these stalkers There is one issue here, and that is the complete lack of upgrades for the Protos player I mean, if you're floating 1,400 minerals and about 1K gas, you could maybe kind of consider getting a couple of forges, maybe a while ago before getting the next six gateways, or before getting your fort base perhaps as well, before the second robotics facility But then again, it is not super necessary He also lost the aggressive observer that he had before. So I do like that second robotics facility, so I can rebuild a couple of observers It's where he had pretty decent map vision before Right now, he's pretty blind, except on the right side, I guess Liberators are being built as well, There's more mines in production And don't forget that the mine was the main unit that he complained about I'm not quite sure why because so far, honestly, he's been dealing with the mines fine I think he lost like two, three stalkers to it But that's about it It's very difficult, by the way, often to move anywhere without knowing where your opponent is. So this type of move over here that he just did is to me absolutely insane because he has zero vision And this is something I see a lot and this is obviously not specific to turn up the base, but it is something you need to pay attention to It's really tricky against Terran to just move out on the map without knowing where the Terran is Because in a base trade, if you don't know where your opponent's army is, you're just going to have a hard time And right now, the one thing you really don't want is a base trade Because if you get a base trade right now, there's a decent chance that you'll end up losing. Well, if you just play out this game and at some point in your life actually throw down Fortress, I don't think there's any way you can lose this game I mean, you're up 23 workers You have an insanely powerful army Two colossite, 26 stalkers You have storm on the way Another war prison You luckily get vision of where your opponent is So you're going to be in position as well Now, here come the mines And now I guess we're starting to expect something out of these mines But these mines get taken out because the observer is still here I do like that a lot Liberators also get taken out Okay Here the observance gets taken out. And then there was a line actually in the imbalance complaint form that I want to go back to He snipes my detection, so then my army is forced to just walk all over mines while he sits safely across the map with his real army Now this is a line that if you read it once and you're not super focused, you might miss it, but no one is forcing him to walk over mines at any point He makes a decision to walk over the mines after he sees them Later on, in the imbalance complaint form, he actually complains that the Protos army marches forward because the AI forgets they saw landmines there two seconds ago. Now, with all those complaints in mind and him specifically calling out the AI for being an idiot saying, well, how can the AI forget all of a sudden that there's mines over here? Let's take a look at what this guy does He attacks the mines, sees that there's minds here, loses his detection, and what is his response? Once his detection is gone, he just moves forward himself And he keeps marching through the mines The AI isn't the idiot He's the idiot He's the one giving the commands He all of a sudden forget that there's minds and he feels forced like he's obliged to walk over that piece of ground He could also have just stayed home for a bit, gotten these. two observers cleaned up the mines He's not really in a hurry whatsoever I mean, he has about 4K resources in the bank Perhaps it might be a wise idea to spend these a little bit, rather than running across the map, trying to force a win the moment you can Once again, this actually is a pretty decent fight for the Prolost, by the way Seize these mines He's going to walk over them because there's no more mines remaining I kind of do like that call Still no forges, by the way Soon to be 2-1 upgrades for the terrorism I think against zero zero Genuinely not the greatest fight that you can have or the greatest upgrade deficit It's not brilliant as a ProDos player. Not brilliant whatsoever Good repair as well I like that these colossar are just focusing on the bunker Not realizing that perhaps it's the SEVs that need to be focused down there Now just like the AI, perhaps this wasn't two seconds, but this was enough for the mines to recharge shoot at these stalkers again He loses a bunch of stalkers Brilliant stuff Of course, mentally once again, he got forced to walk over that specific patch of grass I mean, is there any other way home except over these mines again? Maybe to the left, or maybe he could have stayed here and recalled Or maybe he could have used one of the freaking five observers that apparently he has over here sitting in his natural. Nothing is stopping him from getting observer speed either, by the way, to make these go wherever he wants them to a bit quick Then as he walks back, oh, there's no way, right? There's no way, right? Three, four stalkers? Very unfortunate I mean, personally, if I'm over here, If I'm over here, I also can see a single different way home There's only one road, and that is obviously through this area I mean, that area was already discovered by him, so he knows exactly how to do it It's fantastic. Now, if you don't like using observers and you're actually afraid of minds that they're going to kill you, and you can't control your observers properly, you hate spreading observers, you hate having them with your army, then I do have a small tutorial Boys, hit it Hello, Protos operator Yeah, you Today we're going to learn how to beat widow mines without having detection Are you ready? Great The first thing we're going to do is get our hand from out of our pants Yes And now put it on the keyboard In front of us, we have the unit called the Disruptor You see that? Great Now press the V button and aim at the clump of mines. You will see that all of them will disappear You don't need any detection and it doesn't require any additional micro Isn't that great? Exactly Congratulations, Protos operator You now have learned how to deal with widow mines Wow, there was a very informative piece of piece of video there I'm glad I watched that Great stuff All right Finally, we get some upgrades going as well Don't get me wrong, the ProDos still has absolute light years ahead, despite walking through multiple mines, a couple of times, or about the same minds twice I still believe that the Proz is in a very good position He has solid vision on the map. Once again, he has one observer over here, one observer over here, gets an observer on the right side, even cleans the mines the middle right now with the observed two observers with his army so it seems like the issue of the observer has kind of been well he kind of found a solution here doesn't end up losing that observer even to splash because the mine didn't end up shooting so all of that is nice on top of that we have complete vision of our opponent's army we know what he's getting um not a huge fan of the six colossi often what we do want is we just after three colossi you want to be going into disruptors or immortals because colossi they just don't scale that well into a late game against Viking ghost marauder. They don't deal too well with these units whatsoever So if you can get Disruptors or perhaps even Immortals, I would prefer that However, six Colossi of course are easier to use and thus that's why he probably uses those Colossi 1/1 finishes up Still going to be down at least one upgrade for now, but in the few future perhaps once again, that would be what? 3/3 upgrades? 3/2 against 1/1 That sounds like three upgrades There's also ship weapons on the way That's kind of painful as well Like the Orbital with a bunker It's a cool move If this bunker had gotten repaired, that would have been very good Sadly, not quite the case. Now we see some extreme camping here with the main army, and I don't even really mind it However, when you are camping, you do have to realize that often your army is getting worse If you're not tacking into anything else, if you're not taking into Carrey, you're not tacking into Disruptor and you're already maxed, then you probably should be trading at some point You still want to trade somewhat efficiently You don't just want to run up ramps and lose like that, but you kind of do want to trade So decent first storm, interesting seconds Did he just, the second storm basically hit all of his own units? These storms are quite good, but I'm not so sure about this attack. And he walked up a ramp into five mines and three, well, what was it? Five Liberator zones as well There's no Antire versus the Vikings either Decides to once again run into the planetary, the mines and the Liberator And lose all of his five Colossi against four Vikings Now, if you don't have any Antire and you still have five Colossi, there's two things you can do Well, there's three things you can do Number one is you can warp in stalkers and attack the Vikings Number two is you can go home if you don't want to warp in stalkers or you don't have a warpin available. Or number three, apparently, is you warp in zealots and you move command the colossi into the liberators and into the Vikings That apparently also is a possibility That is not the one that I would personally recommend, but it does have the turn up the base endorsement So if any of you are, you know, are big fans of Turn Up the Base, then you know what he endorsed Five Liberators still here So this is, I think, the point where Turn Up the Base believes he is dead I am not so sure if he's dead He has a lot of money He has 16 gateways He has two robotics facilities as well, which means that technically he should be capable of producing a lot. Sadly, for whatever reason, he's not quite doing that Okay, it's going to add in a couple of salads now Now this is a foreign concept, I think, to turn up the base, but a lot of the time when you can take a good fight, it is fine to not take a fight whatsoever You can wait The moment your opponent is attacking you, isn't necessarily the moment you need to start attacking back You can, for example, sacrifice a base If you're up two bases, like turn up the bases in this case, and you have a lot of cash in the bank, it is completely fine to just wait one or two extra warpins until you're maxed again. It is also fine to move command all of your units into a tiny choke and basically lose 20K resources, but you lose them in chunks of 8K resources at that time because you're only sending in small amounts of your army every single time and you don't actually end up killing anything of your opponent Once again, we know what two turn up the base here, preferred And I was losing small parts of his army Two, two upgrades and eight once again It's just like an AI, just sending in waves It's like playing tower defense, but rather than having towers, you have marauders, liberators, and mines. And every single time that next warping comes, the mines are almost off of cool down again, and they get another hit in Look at this Eight kills on this mine And that's not probes or zirklings That's freaking zealot, stalkers Probably a colossi in there as well And it's absolutely bonkers Absolutely bonkers. void ray now being produced Gigi well played I do like that he types G G G well played he seems like an angry fella in the imbalance complaint for him but he says GG well played yeah well let's just let's just first of all let's check real fast what was it exactly that you complain about it was the widow mine the first thing that I want to note is that I don't even think it was necessarily the widow mind that got you here I think something that was perhaps bigger was the fact that you were constantly down two to three upgrades It is really quite painful when you have a large gateway army that also relies on colossi, so not really spellcasters. I mean, you did have Templar, but out of the three storms you cast, I think two of them were on your own units So let's just forget about those, okay? Really, you didn't build any spellcasters that were useful for you In that case, upgrades are extremely important If you get disruptors or Templar, upgrades are less important because these units they do not benefit from attack and armor upgrades But you were so far behind in upgrades that even in fights where I believe you probably should have easily won with one of your terrible A moves, you still ended up losing And that was just a problem that had nothing to do with you walking through mines 10, 12 times. It's more of a problem of you just not starting forges I mean, you have plenty of money, you have plenty of time You started them sometime after your fort base, then you got 1-1, and then you forgot about 2-2 for another 10 three minutes That is the first issue that I really want to talk about Just the lack of upgrades Then let's just talk about your macro and your builder And let's kind of push these two together I think your initial build order wasn't even that bad It wasn't efficient or optimized But there were some thoughts behind it You knew about the 12 pylon Then sure, you went 12 pylon 14 gate, which doesn't make that much sense. But your DT follow-up, it actually did make some sense the order of the buildings, the Twilight, into the Robo, into the Dark Shrine Sure, you made too many DTs, you got a little bit overeager there Your tech was laid You built way too many stalkers But in general, there was some type of a plan You went straight up to 66 workers as well And then once you felt safe, you took a fort base I genuinely did like all of that There were some issues, however, with your macro You were almost constantly floating above 1K minerals In total, I think probably your average float was somewhere around like maybe 2 5,000 resources, including gas as well. I mean, you end up dying with 3K minerals in the bank and 200 gas, which obviously is not ideal Your infrastructure was very good So that really only leads me to believe that you just don't build enough crap Like you constantly had enough gateways Sometimes the issue is that people have six gateways Well, then you can't spend your money, but you had, what was it? You had, well, 16 gateways or so at the end, 10, 12, 16 gateways, Craptone of Stargates, you had robotics facilities as well, you definitely could spend your money, you just decided not to That sucked, but also perhaps not even really the reason that you lost. The second reason that you lost, combined with the upgrades, was just the way that you engaged And the way that you engaged, it just felt like you were consistently in a hurry. It just didn't make a lot of sense to me because every single time you took a fight you were ahead and time was on your side there was like a massive timer on your opponent's head and you decided to just attack into that timer you attack upper ramp while you have full vision which this is the thing that actually bothers me you had the complete vision the entire time but you never really used that vision to set up a good fight you knew your opponent's eco situation you knew your ecosystem, you know what your infrastructure is, you know how much money you have, you have full information every single time and you kept failing. It's like having the answer sheet at an exam and encircling the wrong letter, you know, if it's a multiple choice It's like you knew it was going to be 10 times A in a row and you did A twice and then 8 times D because maybe it's a trick from the answer sheet It's like it just doesn't make any sense And it's kind of annoying as well to see someone that has a decent idea about just general StarCraft, just completely ruin it Now, yeah, there's attacking up ramps, attacking through chokes again and again and again with small parts of your army when you're trying to rebuild for the final push All of this obviously is not ideal. Then to get to the mines, yes, mines are very good and they're difficult to play against But Protos actually has very good tools They have the observer mode on the observer You can use the disruptors to shoot them, like I said earlier You can also use storm to storm mine clumps You need two storms, but still, it is something that you can do TOS has genuinely quite good tools to deal with them And you knowing where they are and just walking across them like you're forced to doesn't make any sense And that problem is not with the widow mine, my friend, but that problem is with you. And that is why it is not the mine that is in balance, but it is you who sucks You suck Real good All right, that's going to be it for me today Thanks all so much for watching I hope you had a great time If you did, don't forget, hit the like, but subscribe to the channel Hopefully I'll see all of you next time for a new video Thank you And bye-bye."

        "text": "Dear Harstam, Terran are in balance like hell First of all, I gotta say that I suck I know that I have no real build order My macro and micro are bad And often I don't know what to do in situations But besides of that, Terran are just stupidly overpowered and every idiot can play them For example, in my replay, I denied his natural base for a really long amount of time I even had my third up at the time he started his natural mining, but because of mules, he had more income than me with 2 5 bases up Then I attack Dot, dot, dot Two shots of a single tank, which costs only a bit more than one stalker Kill my whole army. When I focus on the tank, the Marines slash marauders kill my whole army in two seconds I must admit my opponent did a lot of harassment, which I had to go back every time and clear it up That's not the problem itself The problem is that Terran has all these units where you only need to build one and it does massive damage to the enemy One mine in the mineral line is game almost over One raven is an infinite amount of stupid turrets and even vision One ghost is EMP, kills whole army shields One tank is massive splash damage to everything plus stupid range. One Liberator is you need stalkers and blink to effectively kill it without losing your mineral line or army when in combination with a tank The list goes on and on But I think you get my problem So please hars them Give me advice how I can win against those ugly guys with my shiny force of aliens Name Solari, race Protos, league platinum, and the server is Europe All right, we got our game A PVT, which is going to be played here on glittering ashes Between two players that scout, well, the Toskouts after his first pylon, and the Terrant Scouts after his first deep Actually, he has two SEVs out on the map already I'm not quite sure what these SEVs are for. I've seen single SEV scouts for eBay blocks, but like this, I haven't quite seen it Cool to see that there's still some innovation happening at the platinum level here This probe is going to get chased all the way back to the base and a full wall at the same time as all Is there a gas? Okay, there's a gas, only mining two in it Very interesting build out of the Terran so far At the same time, we see the Protos player has a gateway, on the low ground So he spots the eBay block immediately Now the correct response here is to pull four workers and start attacking this eBay Well, one worker attacks the SUV, make sure he can't continue building it. The other probes immediately start attacking the eBay That doesn't quite seem to be the response here A second pylon went down before anything Cybernetics score starts, well, 11 seconds, no, 12 seconds late Usually the timing for a cybernetic score is 124 with a regular 14 pylon 16 gate This cybernetic score went down I think at 138 it was 136, 137, somewhere around that time So a 12 second delay without anything happening And then the response to an eBay blocking the natural is chasing an SV with a zealot that you built and getting three gateways before the Nexus. Now, If we compare this to the responses that we see at a high level, usually you pull four workers and you take out the eBay at like 130, 135 You can just throw down a Nexus and you'll have a single gateway that can produce units after You don't have to build a zealot Some people do build the zealot to try and put some pressure on, but generally it's not a great plan. Now, this Reaper is going to come in, kill a couple of workers, or at least I assume it's going to kill a couple of workers, because the stalker not only was the cybercore delayed, but even taking into account that the cybercore was delayed, this stalker is still going to be almost, what is it, 30 seconds too late? Oh wait, there's already a stalker out I completely missed that I was wondering how that happened Why is this stalker so late, I thought Well, the stalker was just chilling downstairs Okay, so this Reaper just did this much damage for no real reason Well, that makes things actually worse, but in some way it also makes me happy that his builder isn't that bad. Well, his build order still is really bad, but at least he got a faster stalker That does make me a little bit happy So finally, about two minutes after the eBay got built, the eBay gets taken out as well Cancel gets used on it, and now the Nexus can go down An alternative approach, by the way, to this, if you don't want to pool workers, is that you can just build the Nexus on your third base location You will have to follow that up with Stargate afterwards, but it's a completely viable way to play I was actually going to flame this Protos player for building three gateways because you can't really use them anyway. But he decided to go for a massive probe cut and not use any of his Kronobo boost And as a result, he could actually afford three units out of all of these gateways pre-warpgate So he now has six units total Once again, if we compare this to any actual build order, he still has less units than I would probably have with about 35 or 38 probes done at this point nonetheless, he hasn't really wasted any buildings yet Very often when something bad happens to lower level players, they'll panic and they start just doing things They start adding random gateways Maybe they add a quick forge, which they can't even afford all of a one-based economy. But here it seemed that although the response was very bad, the response at least, there were no useless buildings Everything that got built so far has been used well, I'd love to see this fourth Gateway being used, but there's absolutely no way You can't afford three Gates of a one base while having to build probes, getting a Robotics Facility, and a Forge at the same time It's simply just not possible And that's why we're seeing not a single warp-in being used in the past, what, minute or so in the past 50 seconds Actually, not a single Warp Gate has been used since Warp Gate has finished These units were all built from Gateways without Warp Gate. and I think to everyone now this should be very obvious that this is obviously not optimal It would be way better to produce less units from the warp case So let's just talk about this for a bit because it's actually very important As a pro-dose player, you always want to get away with as little gateways as you can Because a gateway is a building that doesn't really do anything for you except produce units It's a waste of 150 minerals If you want to hit a tight timing, the first thing you try to do, do is to cut as much of your production as possible, because if you can gain 150 minerals by cutting one warp gate, that would be fantastic. So something that Solari could have done here is rather than getting three gates and producing, what was it, three units out of, or four units out of one gateway and then another set of units out of these two gateways He could have just produced three units out of two gateways total That would have been better already, because in that case, the gateways wouldn't have been idle for so long. Another thing that he could have done is he could have used some of the chronobust energy that he was saving to chronoboast a warp gate twice or three times, cutting off 30 seconds from the warp gate timing and getting two units from each gateway as well and then a warp in at the same timing where usually that third unit would finish from these two final gateways So what I'm trying to say is that Solari invested a lot in infrastructure that is useless for the goal that he's trying to achieve and if you can get somewhere with less infrastructure, that tends to be more optimal And especially this Ford Gateway, so I mean, this is never going to get used. And if it gets used, it is because we don't have constant production out of these gateways What we often want when we optimize build orders is we want constant production on our probes, constant production out of our gateways as well, and constant production out of our other production facilities, and possibly also the tech So adding these things, two gateways, once again, doesn't do anything So far he's added three extra gateways without warping in a single unit He's added a second robotic facility, a robo bay, and a forge without producing any units All of these gateways are useless These three gateways by themselves present the same value as a faster third base would have been able to represent. Actually, you say 50 minerals on that And a faster third base here would have been more useful he might eventually use all six of these gateways but it is not it is not economically optimal to get these this infrastructure as fast as possible it's just not the way now talking about this game a little bit i think i missed a fight here so i kind of want to look at that that little fight again all right so this fight there is a mine here which shoots kills the zealot then these marines take out the zealid as well sure why he lives this command center, but I guess he's afraid And the tank shoots once and kind of forces this away. Honestly, not a terrible fight for the Protos player I mean, he lost two zealots, but also had two mules not working for a while This should have been a worse fight if the tank was in a better position But I still believe this was, this honestly was kind of okay I like the position of the Protos player here, as he's up 11 workers, forcing out a turret as well here at the same time So this actually looks, it looks good despite his failings so far And that's because the Taryn opener also wasn't absolutely brilliant The Taryn is a little bit afraid of holding his low ground as well Stalker controls actually quite good You see some single target fire on these marines. For Stalkers, of course, take out a single Marine Okay, so these were these the two tank shots? Okay, well that's a third tank shot I like that he went in back one more time to make sure that it really was a tank shooting Is this the fight that he was describing in his thing? He described a fight, two shots of a single tank kill my whole army I mean, he lost one stalker here I doubt this was the fight, right? It really would surprise me It really would surprise me this was a fight Because this fight honestly, you lost the stalker, but it's not the end of the world Okay, Raven's going to make its way across the map. Three more barracks on the way here for the Terran, who, It does have stim already It hasn't started Combat Shield and a slightly supply block Once again, I'd like to note that none of these extra gate so far, these three haven't produced anything These three haven't built a single unit from Warp Gate yet We're still just stuck on the three stalkers from earlier And right now, without ever warping in any gateway units, our Protos player decides it's time to throw down three more gateways on top of this He could have triple expanded at this point, and his army size would have been exactly the same Nothing would have changed in the army size, except he would have had a way better eco. So it really makes no sense The way that he's playing, the way that he's adding production here is, it's just really, really odd It actually does make zero sense There's a double drop heading towards the main base Now, this is the one scenario in which the extra infrastructure is actually useful If you're getting dropped and you have six gateways, you don't have to move your use units in position, but you can just warp in a big warp in I guess he's going to do both, move his units and position and do a big warp in Kind of like that, dealing with this drop Almost gets the Metafact, because the Terran control that a little bit sloppily. But does not quite end up getting it Perhaps with these disruptors? No Metafacts are going to fly away So right now, all of these gateways have been used once And if I recall correctly, Warpgate finished at around the 4 minute mark That means that every four minutes so far, on average, he's been doing a war pin That is a very bad score, my friend That actually is a very, very bad score And the funny thing is that I'm afraid it's going to continue, because he seems very focused on getting more units out of these robotics facilities than anything else Now, then here we have two cannons, which are in odd positions as well. I wouldn't mind if there was one cannon here and one cannon here, but right now this entire area is kind of that, okay, there's another current cannon here It is expensive, but if you don't ever want to deal with multitasking, this might be the way forward Drop us heading towards the third base At the same time, our Protos player is actually attacking Oh, I bet this is going to be the fight This is, by the way, a very ill-informed timing attack, okay? I'd just like to point your attention, just direct your attention into the position that we're currently in, and just show you guys what a terrible call-loss is, okay? So let's just get back. First of all, a lot of money is invested in infrastructure, which when you invest money into infrastructure, you are preparing for a further away future because infrastructure has no inherent value right at that moment You can have two gateways and 10 units, or you can have eight gateways and one unit Well, it's obviously better for a timing attack to have the 10 units and the two gateways but in the longer term, once your eco starts going, you'll need those extra gateway So gateways are always an investment into the future, never in the direct moment Second of all, there is a lot of investment in cannons here This is what, 450 in the natural or in the main, another 300 at the natural. We have another 300 at the third base So we have about, well, I can't count, but I think it adds up to about 1,000,000-50 or so, minerals invested in static defense This shows to me that the plan for Solari should be with that investment in infrastructure and the investment in static defense that it should be to remain defensive That would make sense given the fact that he's up an entire base and up 20 workers This push makes zero sense His opponent is about to all in into him, is forced to all in into him And the fun thing is that Solari is actually well prepared He has a lot of infrastructure He has a lot of cannons as well. It's very unlikely that he will die But because he's moving out, he gives his opponent here a chance to actually not only attack him at the third base, but also drop some mines in the natural, have another little pushover here And while this is happening, we see this tank actually shelling out a decent amount of damage Hello? You just started attacking his own eBay? This base gets lifted Now, the moment your opponent lifts their natural, I think this is such a clear sign that perhaps it's time to go home and defend your three bases and your 20 worker lead However, Solari here decides to walk up a ramp where there's two tanks in which he doesn't have vision Oh, actually, there's three tanks. He doesn't have vision and loses his entire army This was not a single tank shot What did he? Okay, this was the fight he was talking about Two shots of a single tank, which cost only a bit more than a single stalker First of all, a tank costs a creptle more than a stalker It's really gas-intensive It's an annoying unit to build It takes quite long It's expensive It's more supplied than a stalker Obviously, it's not the same as a stalker So you could say that the roach is a bit of a cheap stalker, but a tank is a way more expensive unit It just functions completely different You can't really compare it One is a seat unit. One is a very flexible attacking unit also has an anti-ar attack, but whatever Anyway, he attacks into three tanks, and he believed that this was a single tank Now, honestly, if I walked into three tanks with my army, and I would lose my army, but I somehow live under the illusion that that was a single tank, I also would be extremely upset, because then I also would believe that the tank is overpowered I mean, that tank should, holy crap, what is this? The tank just showcased the power of three tanks So I understand why he's upset if he's this delusional This was a very weird move as well, by the way So the turret is a unit that runs out of time. So all you need to do is just wait and eventually it will die It makes no sense to send in units to kill it if you're going to lose units to kill it because it will run out of time Better is to just pull away your workers for a little bit, wait He will shoot at the assimilator or the pilot you will be fine What he did just here, losing two stalkers, is kind of like challenging a 110-year-old for a jewel Like, sure, most likely you're a bit quicker with the revolver and you'll still win the duel, but there's really a lot of, still some risk involved, and it's probably better just to wait it out I mean, there are 110. How long can it last? Raven's going to move forward Now, this is a case where you need to attack the turret in order to defend your third base, so that's 100% the correct call These Marines and Marauders get a little bit of damage And the fun part is, rather fun, the sad thing is, is in this game, despite Solari's biggest efforts to actually throw it and him being down about 3K in the unit lost tap, he still was actually ahead I mean, he's up a base, similar upgrades He has an extremely well-tapped army He's up in supply. If he just builds like three waves of probes and finally kills his mine, which has 11 kills, by the way, I didn't really pay attention to this yet because there were so many other bad things happening at the same time Sometimes I have this It's like some type of sensory overload, but with like really bad play If there's too many bad plays happening at the same time, I can't see them all at once anymore, you know? It becomes too hard to analyze every single one That's what happened here So Lari truly is pushing the limits of making every conceivable mistake He's still ahead, though Like this is, the Terran has not been producing workers at all Like, that's really just a reason. I mean, the Protos killed six workers and the Terran's only at 28 That's actually bad play out of the Terran And it just, yeah, it just isn't great Double turrets once again going in No defense for the turrets Just pulls them away Kind of like that Good call And then put them back to mine It actually was a very, very good response to the Raven because the turrets can't chase you It's a static unit that, that expires in a while the sensor tower position is quite interesting as well. Now, after the last time's experience of going into a position blindly and remembering how poorly that went, Solari decided to live that same experience once again, loses both disruptors, gets a couple of shots on these sand trees, like, huh, maybe if I warp in three more stalkers, I can try that same thing again Not considering that perhaps one of the two observers currently trailing his army might be used as a spotting device to see if he can actually attack into the position On top of that, it might also be wise to consider getting charged if you're playing against a lot of tanks Salats are quite good at tanking shots and stalkers don't necessarily trade super well against tanks. If your plan is to just a move into positions the entire game, I would recommend a Charlott Arkham composition rather than a Stalker Colossi composition With a Stalker Colossi composition, it tends to be more important to actually control your army because you don't want to be fighting, you just want to be abusing your range with the sentries and the stalkers So far what Solari has been doing is he made an army that wants to abuse the range, but rather than abusing the range, he just runs up there and then starts fighting That's kind of like using a gun to knock someone out. Sure, it's still a pretty powerful weapon because it's quite heavy, but it would be a lot better if you use the range on it and that's not what Solari has been doing so far Still, I think two observers over here, beautiful with this army, making sure that he has zero vision on the map whatsoever Nothing on the right side Drops have been happening this entire game No pylon, no pylon, no unit over here, no unit over here, no pilot over here, no observer at the army A battlecruiser teleports across the map The correct response against the battlecruiser never is to warp in two stalkers in a slow warping pylon. for the people that are not aware, actually, I know some of you don't play too much, but there's two types of pylons You have the fast warping pylon and the slow warp in pylon If a pylon is in powering range of a nexus or a gateway, the warp in takes only three seconds If the pylon is not in warping range of a gateway or a nexus, the warping of the stalker takes it, I believe, seven or eight seconds It's a really long time It feels like three years So I'd always recommend warping in close to a nexus or a gateway So all of these pylons would have been fine. However, he warped in two near a pylon that wasn't close by an excess, and thus the pylon actually got taken out before the stalkers even could finish warping I love that the response out of Solari, no matter what happens, just seems to be to attack Oh, there's a single battle cruiser in my base That probably means the best move here to do is to attack into the same tank line that I attacked into earlier I really do believe this is an almost unloosable game So, hello, could we use the Guardian Shield perhaps? But Solari is honestly just trying his best to lose it Colossi also target firing the Thor is a sight to behold Good disruptor shot though. Rather than going for units that actually take extra damage from the Colossi, like the Marines or the SCVs Okay, this is the first time in the game where I'm actually scared for Solari He took such a bad fight that he's currently down 6K this Battlecruiser managed to kill a bunch of crap as well, which is hard to imagine as a single Battlecruiser loses, I think, against like five or six Stalkers, which, let's not forget, he could have warped in that amount of Stalkers while being on one and a half base mining Auto-Turret comes in once again, workers get pulled Well, not quite, but almost good enough Almost good enough This Terran has a play style as well, by the way. This type of stuff I don't really see anymore at my level but a planetary at the 3rd I hadn't even noticed that yet Two marauders in the bunker Sensor tower placement Sometimes I just miss playing on slightly lower level games, you know It just seems like these people have way more fun They can kind of do whatever you want And against people like Solari, it might even work All right So the Terran is actually up in income right now Ever so slightly Work account is very close Solari, by the way, has been on 46 workers for the past 35 minutes as well So, did he just build a phoenix to deal with this raven? You know what? I don't even mind it. I was going to make fun of him for that, but I don't even really care If you hate playing against a raven, then getting a phoenix is completely fine I said what I said Yeah, snip it I don't give a crap Perfect That was good Now, there's another thing that Pro, where Protos has a huge advantage over the other races and that is that Protos is actually going to build a bunker, is that Protos has a very good gas sink in the Templar archives with the High Templar. Because the Archon is such a powerful unit, if you're floating a lot of gas, you just throw down a Templar archives warp in like 10 Templar and boom, you're rid of your gas bank and at the same time you just created an insanely powerful army with five Archons I still believe that the way for Solari to play in the future is to just get charged and Arcons because the way he controls his army, well, I wouldn't exactly call it controlling He just A moves into a position and sometimes it even is a move command He just kind of move commands into a position Charcelot Arcon is way more suited for that than Stalker Immortal Centrius. So if I were to give you one piece of advice that really needs to stick, it is to try to not build units that require any type of control You know, sometimes you just have to admit your weaknesses, and your weakness seems to be that you can't control units, and that you make really bad decisions So ideally, also, you wouldn't make decisions anymore But, yeah, that might be a little bit hard to play then But yeah, maybe you get like a friend over or something that just tells you what to do Or, well, this actually might be an okay-ish fight for Solari here still would have loved to see a guardian shield here Once again, zealots would be so useful against the tanks. Also at tanking marauders shots, by the way Don't forget that stalkers are armored, so take extra damage from these marauders Which means that having a couple of zealots to tank is always very helpful Yeah, maybe you should just pre-record, you know, at certain points in the game There are every minute or so, there's a pre-recording of you going, don't attack if you're up two bases if your opponent builds 30 tanks and sits them on top of his main ramp, don't walk into it You know, and then you just play that with like general pieces of advice. And after every single game, you can just add something, you know, if you make another silly mistake, you just ask one of your friends what your mistakes was, and then boom, they'll tell you, and then you record that as well I actually give you a free sample at the end of a couple that might be useful for you Don't worry I'll get the base ones covered Nice stalker warp in I like that the Once again, two extra gateways were being added somewhere Yeah, here So right now we're up to 10 gateways, I guess Yeah, 10 gateways is going to be the answer Beautiful stuff really Especially because he tends to just use them once every two minutes. And he's been lacking money for the past five minutes as well So it's really not that wise of an investment, but Honestly, I guess at lower levels I'd rather have too much infrastructure rather than too little infrastructure And 10 gates of a 4-bay, well, 52 workers It is very low eco It really is quite low eco Okay, here we go again Let's do the Solari checklist No vision of our opponent Check An army that consists of units that function very well in a longer lasting engagement with, you know, kind of dancing back and forth Check Absolutely no clue of the seat's position Check Let's move command in, boys We're ready I'm wondering if he's actually going to go or not. Oh, yes, of course If there's one thing Ooh, that was a good disruptor shot Holy crap Is this fight actually going to win? No, it's not Oh Oh Yeah, the anti-armor missile is really, really big against battle closers as well because they attack so darn fast Actually, it's a semi-winning fight If there was a prison with this army, I think it might have been, like a 10 stalker warping would have really been huge I really would not have minded that Did that Battlecruiser just teleport across the map? Oh, yes, it did Okay, so we have money ready I do believe we have warp gates ready as well I wouldn't mind the warpin of some stalkers here There we go Dealing with that BC. How many BCs have died so far? By the way, two, three Worker kills of 50 as well total And his turn is a harassing god Parks it over here again This is a legendary position already, in my opinion Taryn moves out with two Vikings No matter of acts whatsoever Going in for some harass Look at these tank positions as well I guess this is really cool If you just build tanks and planetaries everywhere, people like Solari will consistently walk into it And although you never shoot wind fights, you do kind of keep winning them Solari's still down 4K, but at this point that Terran really is out mining his opponent. So not only does Solari need to start mining more, but Solari also needs to take winning engagements And that's honestly the part I'm most afraid of Still, by the way, absolutely zero vision on the map Nothing over here, nothing over here He's just gambling where his opponent's going to be He also has an entire army parked against a single battlecruiser This is the type of multitasking that I love to see And now this BC actually teleports out That was great That's a great little interaction there Now, if I were to predict what Solari is about to do next, every single time where he wasn't quite sure what was happening, he usually moves out or if he's not in position for something. So I think that after he kills this bio army, because the bio army revealed itself, he's just going to straight move across the map I don't think there's any other solution here Oh, nice A couple of mine shots Very cool Yeah, he's just going to chase this He's a simple man He has the go mode and the no-go mode Oh, and now the battle cruiser as well in this base And now, ooh, actually warps in Stalky Well, I'm not sure if that's going to be good enough Blink, blink! Wanted to blink to dodge it Actually, good defense I really did like this defense Well, it wasn't brilliant, but it was pretty good. A good trick, by the way, in general, if you're dealing with Battle Cruiser harass, is to get a battery per mineral line This forces the Battlecruiser to initially start shooting the battery before they can start attacking anything else And also, if you warp something in and the battery is still alive, whatever you warped in is going to win the fight So against Battle Cruiser harass, actually getting a battery per base, it's just an extremely useful tool And it's a lot more useful than cannons Because even though cannons, they deal damage and batteries do not, batteries keep everything alive and they ensure that you have a higher eco. Okay, once again, I think we finished up the Solari checklist here, no vision whatsoever, not being aware of the siege line, and just aim moving into his opponent's army I think all of these kind of get checked Honestly, the disruptor control has been good out of Solari This is the one thing I have to admit, which is absolutely mind-blowing, because you actually have to select the purification Nova and control it to click it on a unit And he hasn't been capable of clicking on any units with the rest of his army So it just is kind of surprising to me Obviously, this once again was a terrible fight As Solari right now is down, well, about 9,000 resources Impressive Very, very impressive. Battle Cruiser once again gets teleport Oh my God, this guy has 33 kills How did this guy get 33 kills? Was this the guy from earlier that went into nothing mess? I guess so, huh? I can't believe that the BC harassed is what did him in I also can't believe that the only star port is a tech-lact star port that has been building BCs consistently, which means there's like a negative amount of Metafax Yeah, there's literally two Metafax right now It's actually a crazy low amount Now, at this point the game is extremely over and there are 17 workers remaining. There's a single worker mining at this space and now he decides to build a battery to defend these three workers rather than when there was 35 workers mining there Cool Very, very cool B C gets teleported into a base where there's nothing there That obviously is a mistake I think this BC might actually die I know this BC will die Holy crap Stalkers with Plus 3 deal so well with it It's actually crazy That's really, really cool to see I'm a huge fan of that Well, it doesn't really matter because Solari is completely dead. Sadly for Solari, he's rather unaware of that because he has no vision of his opponents, preferring to keep all three observers with his main army at all times to make sure that if he loses two observers, that there still will be one to provide detection against widow mines Because that really has been the issue of this game, of course, the widow mines, not the fact that he kept walking into siege lines Now, once again, L Green is going to go for a little drop We might even see some real multitasking here This drop will hit, and at the same time maybe attack this base Very, very cool Oh, oh, stims almost at the same time There even is a move over here. Solari doesn't know what's happening Boom Multi-prong, baby Now, there's two things here that Solari can do One, he could leave Two, he could move across the map Oh, goes for the first one Leaves without a Gigi as well, of course, because this wasn't a good game Stupid siege tanks Now, I want to go over this complaint for him one more time He said, first of all, I got to say that I suck I know that Well, I'm glad you already know, so I don't have to tell you that again But I think everything else in this little form actually was incorrect The two shots of a single tank obviously wasn't true It was three tanks that shot you like five times. Like there's a difference between two shots total and 15 shots total And if you don't recognize that, I honestly have a very difficult time seeing how you will improve in the future When I focus on the tank, the Marines slash marauders kill my whole army in two seconds Okay, this actually never happened First of all, you never really focused on a tank And also, if you have an army that gets hard countered by tanks, like Stalker Colossi kind of does get hard countered, you can either do two things One, you can move around the tanks and try and pull your opponent out of position, keep map control, and then just kind of poke into different bases, forcing the Terran to reposition the tanks. Then once the tanks are unseached, you can go in Sadly, this requires vision, which is honestly one of the things that you really did like Your vision this game was absolutely terrible And I'm not even just talking about map vision Like you had no pylons on the map, no units on the map, no observers in good locations, but also the vision in front of your army for when you want to attack into a position was just god-awful Not a single time did you have any clue whatsoever what your opponent was doing None You just did not understand what was going on a single time Really, not even once And that is a huge issue That actually is a huge issue. If you use an army like Starhawk or Colossi, you can't do that This is why, first of all, absolutely terrible, terrible vision And this is also why I suggest to you to play Charcelot Arconne Immortal from now on out Just, it's an army that A moves easily You don't need as much vision They kind of do the themselves Sure, it's a weaker composition in certain situations, but for you, I think it's always going to be the better call Two, your decision making Your decision making in this game was really, really terrible, and a lot of that comes from a complete lack of scouting, knowing what's going on But also, it seems like you're incapable of basic logic, which is painful to say. You're up two bases As you stayed in the form, you attack into someone that is down 20 workers while you're investing a lot into the late game This makes absolutely zero sense to me And the funny thing is that you even realize these things, but then you don't realize the mistake that perhaps attacking into your opponent as they're all-inning you isn't the correct call So, yeah, for that also insufficient points Not very well done For the actual build order and the opening, well, it seems obvious you don't have a build order you don't really know any regular responses to pretty basic variations like an eBay block The logic of the infrastructure that you throw down is very difficult to see. At least I can't find any logic in it The entire game just doesn't make a lot of sense You have one redeeming quality, and that is that you spend your money quite well Like really, like legitimately, I think your macro skills, your mechanics seem to be quite good that's what keeps you in the games Your pro production is a little bit lacking, but that's the one thing I'd say, you know, good job for your level It's obvious to me, however, that is not Taryn that is imbalanced It is not the siege tank that costs as much as a stalker No, my friend, it is you who sucks Yes, you do All right, that's going to be it for today. Thanks all so much for watching Don't forget did like and subscribe to the channel Oh, and before I forget, here are the three voice lines you can use next time you're lettering So the first one will be Are we up two bases and 60 probes? If the answer is yes, just stay at home and don't do anything Those one Two Are we about to engage into a position and we have no knowledge of what is in this position? Try to get some knowledge of what is behind the first two units Are there siege tanks behind it? Are there perhaps lurkers? Are there disruptors in the back? Figure it out All right Number three. If we are not going to be producing from our gateways for the next six minutes, we don't have to add more gateways We can use the gateways that we already have All right I hope this helps Thank you for watching Don't forget the like button Subscribe and bye-bye."

I could have sworn I had this game with my salad run-bys, even taking out his natural, exclamation mark His composition made very little sense, consisting of everything from Ling to Roach to Reveger to Mutha Sounds pretty normal to me, but we'll have a look, I guess How can I, as a Protos, switch to air with such little notice? There is just no way to get the infrastructure up in time to counter Zirk air P S I know I lost some important units due to carelessness, as well as my decision-making at times being questionable Sorry, I had a few glasses of wine while playing this game So our drunk protos player called Jonathan is a diamond player on North America, 3,800 MMR. He's playing against a Zirk player called Happy Taryn That is a, well, like I said, a Zerk his initial plan was to cannon rush but that plan got foiled because his opponent forgot to build a hatchery that is interesting to start with he sends out his first work this is not how you cannon rush at all by the way some of you might not be aware but when you cannon rush your opponent one of the most important things is to not to try and block your opponent's natural hatchery you don't need to send out your worker this fast because your forge can't finish at this point anyway Your pylon barely finishes So being here early, which a probe makes no sense. Okay, so he sees a drone move on the map Then he scouts that his opponent has no hatchery, which makes sense because it's 46 seconds Also, he saw a drone walk by So he might even believe that there's a base at the third And then as he walks in the main, he sees a drone go to the natural and throw down a hatchery What was this? Four seconds ago At 54 seconds Now, take it into account that the Zirk player scouted initially with a drone and then build a hatchery This is probably the fastest possible hatchery This was a 17 hatch It could have been a 16 hatch So this hatchery was delayed by about three seconds total Three seconds. If this is the standards that we're using to judge this game by, I think Jonathan might be in a little bit of trouble Because this Zerk hatchery was literally only three seconds too late He saw the drone go down into the natural and he saw a drone pass by him as well Like, he's the complete lack of a pool as well And this is the point, usually, where with a cannon rush, you would start your first pylon Between 58 seconds and one minute and four, five seconds Because at that point, you have enough money to do a triple wall with pylons On this map, I believe you need four pylons, so you probably would wait a bit longer. This would be the moment to cannon, to start your first pylon He's not transitioning out of this yet at this point he can still do it He knows there's no pool in the main base So you can still just go for the cannon rush Also, the forge being in the main base, not in the wall here or in the wall downstairs, is a really odd call because that makes it difficult to hold any potential link runbyes if you would end up going for a cannon rush You would have to get a cannon in your main base. But if they would proxy hatch and get three roaches and send them behind your mineral line out of range of the cannon, it would be very annoying which is why usually when you cannon rush you either make a wall on top of the ramp or you make a wall on the low ground He scouted the hatch first as well at this point now He sees the timing of this This is just a hatch first timing He knows his opponent has no pool So there's full information I just don't understand what he's talking about in his first part of the balanced complaint for him here It seems obvious to me that this was completely cannon rushable. If he was, wanted the cannon rush, if he had any idea on how to cannon rush And now for whatever reason, he decides to transition out of it by going double gas, gateway, and not taking a Nexus yet He's also getting a third and a fourth pylon before throwing down the nexus and creating, what type of awe is this? A pylon on one side, another pylon on the other. like this is obviously very mediocre Nexus gets thrown down now that these pylons don't do anything whatsoever like really just just whatsoever where was that okay so I just want to talk about these pylons because this makes no sense to me right you build your second pylon on the high ground and then you realize oh wait I also need to get a natural you build pylon three and four on the low ground you're never going to use this pylon this pylon was one that was necessary you could have this built that one over here and started a wall with that single pylon. Adding these two extra pylons and delaying your nexus by another like 15 seconds, about five times as long as your opponent delayed their hatchery And according to you, that already was pretty bad This is obviously not good If we were to compare this game, by the way, with a standard game, you wouldn't be looking too hot Let me tell you that Cybernetics score in a standard game would finish about two minutes and 11 seconds or 2 minutes and 12 seconds into the game, you're going to be about 50 seconds late with your own cybercore for no real reason except for the fact that your opponent's hatchery was 2 seconds delayed No other reason I like the cannon against the hatchery in the wall. I think it's a good call The plus one on the forge This is something that a lot of people do when they open up with a cannon rush and the cannon rush doesn't go so well They feel kind of tempted to use that forge for something Because like, well, I build it anyway I might as well get some use out of it But often it's better to just get an actual tech building So Stargate, Robo, Twilight Actually, don't get Robo Just play either Twilight and go for some type of glave attack afterwards or go for Stargate anyway Because opening up with Quick Plus One into Robo is just not very good at any level, in my opinion, at least. I understand if you don't agree, we can talk about that But I think in general, starting with a quick plus one off of a failed cannon rush, usually just gives your opponent a lot of time to prepare for something Because the plus one isn't super useful in any type of scenario, except maybe an immortal in, and the plus one just gives your opponents more time to prepare for such an immortal in So even in that case, I don't think it's too good There's really no scenario in which I believe that the fast plus one is going to help you out too much So we should skip that in the future. you go into two more gateways on the low ground as well another pylon being added as you're currently only have 20 supply available so that definitely is a necessity here that pilot i like that plus one is being researched you're not starting at twilight like if you're going to rush into upgrades it's important that your upgrades can continue the moment that your first upgrade finishes right otherwise you're rushing out this plus one but you don't really look to be hitting a timing with a fast plus one Whenever you're investing heavily into whether that be blink, glaves, a plus one, you always got to ask yourself, hey, what is the point of this? I'm dedicating a. Wait, don't you go armor? Armour's really bad against Cirque It's another rule here We don't get armor against Sirk We get attack upgrades against Zirk and maybe eventually we get shield upgrades if we have a lot of Arcons or if we get air, but don't get armor upgrades Anyway, what I was going to say is that whenever you're getting upgrades You either want to continuously be building upgrades if you're investing in them early So get your plus one, fast Twilight Council, then you get your plus two That just makes a lot of sense What doesn't make a lot of sense is that you rush out your plus one and then you can start your plus two. So you have to start armor, which is useless And you're also not hitting a tight timing with this Like if you were hitting with charge and plus one and a prism across the map right now, then the plus one at least would have some use as you're using it in the fight at that moment But right now you rush something out and you dedicated a lot of resources to it You dedicated chronobo boost into it You probably delayed your third base for it as well And it doesn't give you anything right in this moment So you're basically went for a timing, except you're not doing anything with that timing. It's sending an invitation letter to all of your friends to meet at 6 p m in front of your house And then when they all show up, just open your window you give them the finger, then you go back inside Trust me, they won't remain your friends for very long I have tried Third base is going to get built here Also way too late, of course It really doesn't have any major use here Going into charge, your scouting is, well, abysmal, to be quite honest with you Subserver has only spotted the creep so far If you do open up with a build like this, I suggest getting a fast centric, which you actually did. then using an hallucination for a quick scout around the base One of the main things you want to be fighting against or you want to be looking for is the amount of gases and whether your opponent has a spire or not Because if you open pure ground, so no Stargate opener and you're not going into blink, mutalists are the biggest threat that could potentially hurt you And it's important for you to know how much gas there is. If you see six extractors being thrown down already and you see no roaches and just pure links, you could kind of put one-on-one together and be like, hey, where's all that gas that he's mining going? And he's probably saving that up either for a crap load of banlings, or he wants to go into some type of mutalism This time that's not the case Instead, it's just going to be a Reveager Roach army It's of relatively low gas Your opponent doesn't have that many workers, which is also important to figure out Often when So the way that Zirk functions, Zerk always wants to get all of their minerals first They always want to do that. So ideally Zirk players, they saturate three mineral lines worth of minerals So 16 over here, 16 over here and 16 over here And then they start adding the extra gases That is the most optimal way for Zerk to play them Can you get a Ford base? They can start saturating those gases off because they have more money or more minerals And minerals are the only way to create more economy Drones cost minerals, queens cost minerals, extractors cost minerals, hatcheries, costs minerals, et cetera, et cetera Okay So if you see very quick extra gases and not that many drones, that probably means he wants to be aggressive because he's stacking into something without a lot of economy. If he would have scouted this, which of course you kind of did with this observer, you see no gases here, you saw a low drone count You could have used the hallucination to maybe scout that there's no gas over here either I always tell myself that if I am up in gases against a Zirk player, that is a good timing to start building batteries and batteries because it most likely means that the Zirk player is going to attack you if you have more gases than the Zerk player at that moment And also just more workers than the Zerk player at that moment And right now you're about equaling gas You have the same amount of workers. You also could, of course, call that this army That would have been helpful as well But you're completely unaware of the fact that he's moving out across the map This moveout, he's been preparing this since about minute five He's been building units And this moveout comes at this point, seven minutes and 30 minutes into the 7 minutes and 30 seconds into the game And you have absolutely no clue about it He has full vision with this changeling as well Your army is in position You don't have any batteries ready Let's see how you respond in this fight So you had a couple of force fields You don't use them You eat two bios, three bios, four bile. Now, if bios could feed a man, right now you would be full And you have been eating bile for dinner Let's see if you can perhaps thank a couple more Look at that There's another biol Boom Another one Your belly at this point is practically exploding All your sentries have gone down without casting a single spell Another bile hits These are the first two vials you dodge Usually, maybe 20 seconds into the fight, most people would say, well, it is acceptable to get hit once or twice by biles But you kind of reverse that, and you didn't get hit by biles once or twice in a 20-second fight every other bile you managed to hit. If this was a Mario Party game, you probably would have gotten a lot of coins Because I think that's how Mario Party games work, where you don't need to catch stuff and you get coins I haven't played Mario Party in seven years But yeah, this obviously wasn't it You should still be able to hold this because, well, you do Actually, you don't have the greatest upgrades You have 1-1 Colosai comes out, though, and with charge, you should be kind of fine Colossi tried to take these bile as well well, didn't quite make it I almost believe you should be dead here. If the Zerk had spent any of his money at this point, this game would be completely over and you would have had absolutely no chance whatsoever Double immortal production, I don't really mind it I don't quite get why you went into Colossi in the first place, as Colossi aren't that great in this matchup But I do like that you're transitioning out of it Building two more sentries And here's another, actually, another to see you rebuild those sentries Here's a, here's a, a piece of advice If you don't know how to use a unit, don't build it. And this sounds stupid because then people are like, well, how will I ever learn how to use it? Practice using it first and then use it in your view games But if you're never going to use a single Force Field or Guardian Shield in your games, then don't use the unit Don't build the unit You've now invested like 600 gas and 300 minerals in Sentry so far this game and you haven't cast a single Force Field or a Guardian Shield So practice the hotkeys on the Sentry It's fine if you don't know how to use a unit I don't have any issues with that I'd never make fun of you for that. But if you build six sentries and you never use it once in a game, yeah, that's generally not a good thing So now you restart Colossi production again You still have absolutely zero information about what your opponent is doing He's into six gas right now Double evo, well, single evo, one of the two still go A couple of force fields This is good I like that And there's a spire coming up But you have absolutely zero scouting information You don't know what's going on Well, look at you You start micro-ing against piles as well Very nice This was a good fight Actually a good fight I'm quite impressed by that You haven't really put any pressure on your opponent the entire game. You haven't scouted your opponent the entire game And that's why so far every single interaction between you and him has been somewhat of a surprise for you He's going up to eight gas once again you see eight gas and your opponent is building a crapton of links, that probably is a decent indication that something is going to happen with that gas In this case, it's going to be Bainlings You also, I think, mentioned in your complaint from what did you say about this, his composition made very little sense, consisting of everything from Ling to Roach to Reveager to Mutha So far, his composition to me made a lot of sense. Reveager, Ling, Bain, is one of the most popular compositions, and has been one of the most popular compositions for the past seven years of legacy of the void It is extremely good against Stalker Colossi, as banlings deal well with Stalkers Reverger's can bile as well, and they can break force fields, which are often in combination, are there in combination with the Stalker army So I honestly really like his composition I like your composition less than I like his, because you're playing this kind of in-between A-Move army and this army that wants, to fight from a distance Have a couple of zealots in there and these immortals as well But then you also get a bunch of sentries and stalkers These fights are good. This is how this army is supposed to be used Rather than having the zealots in the main army, though, as they don't really synergize well with this, what I would suggest is if you play an army like this, and very often your warpins can't consist of only stalkers because you just don't have the gas So what you do is you warp in the zealots, and you just use the zealots to take out bases on the side So you send zealots to the left, Sellets to the right and from there and out, well, hopefully deal a little bit of damage That is kind of the way that you're supposed to play this type of composition. Now, you're still completely unaware of what your opponent is doing You're not even aware that he has a fort base, let alone that he has a fifth and a sixth going up right now You're taking your own fort base There's eight gases This spire has been done for almost an entire minute You're lucky your opponent hasn't built a muda yet because you have absolutely no units that deal with the mutas You have 15 stalkers, but these stalkers do not have blue and it makes it really difficult for you to deal with Murales. After rushing out your initial upgrades, you also completely stopped upgrades, although you could just start your plus three, and it would really help this army, because attack upgrades on stalkers and Colossi are absolutely fantastic Here come the first nine Muras, you continue immortal production I don't understand how you can play like this Like, it's really a miracle to me You have almost no map vision You have no static defense in this space You have no static defense in this space either The only vision you have is the single old vision you have is the single, observer and your army on the far left side You don't know where your opponent's army is. If a run by hits you on this base, you're going to lose every single worker If a run by hit you on this page, you're going to lose every single worker You're moving on creep like you own the place But honestly, at any point, this army could have beaten you as well while you were on creep You got lucky that the Zerk was afraid But this guy is freaking 19 banlings with plus two He would have blasted your stalkers, no problem The only reason why he didn't was because he was probably waiting for the mutas to go attack across the map You also have no idea whatsoever what your opponent is doing. In your mind, you could technically still be on hatchery tack, although I do believe you've seen bainling speed So you do know he is on layer already because obviously centrifugal hooks does require layer attack He's on 86 workers The Zerker is playing well, by the way It's quite a solid Zerk player I do like that Investation pit gets thrown down as well and we'll go into Hive Now the MUDAS make their way into your main base And I guess you start taking out, look at your opponent Look at your positioning here He is in between your army and your base He could just attack this base and win This is a good run by though This is a very good run by. And I really do like that So you teleport back into your main base and at the same time he attacks your third You take out his sixth base and he is taking out your third base He killed like 12 workers in your main as well At this point I feel like you're pretty dead, I would say If this Zerk decides to right click this building rather than half fighting your army, half fighting the buildings, which I do believe to be a mistake for now You get a pretty Actually, do you get an okay trade? Seems kind of okay You lose a lot of crap, but you also kill a lot of crap. The end of the day, I think right now you're pretty dead Salads bringing them back is a good call What I like to do, if I have a run by all salads, is that I send three zealots over here and then pull the others back that way you force the reinforcements to stay home So if you're having a very tight hold, the one thing you'd really love to do is your opponent having reinforcements at home And most of the time, they're going to send all reinforcements to your harass, whether it's three zealots or seven zealots So that's why I like to send just three zealots Once again, this is a very, very good move This does so much for you. One, it gets you scouting information what units are being built Two, it gives you some breathing room because let's be real You just managed to barely survive And on top of that, you potentially can deal some damage Maybe kill another base And worst case scenario, you just need to run away Like, there's not that much creep He can chase you easily I don't quite understand this move out You just got absolutely blasted on your side of the map You're now aware that he most likely has been on at least five bases for a very long time So you know there's money for your opponent This move seems risky You also move out without knowing anything. And I think that is really the main issue for you so far this game is that, oh my God, I can't believe you're winning this fight This makes me, it actually does upset me This never should have happened He's 20 larva You are not allowed to push out You are dealing damage, but you shouldn't be The correct call here was to sit at home And I absolutely hate it when people make the incorrect call and it pays off because their opponents forgot to hold down the roach button If this guy had built 20 roaches like he should have, you would have absolutely died Now, you can't say, well, at lower level, this is a good move But that's not correct. This is always a bad move What you could have done is just send your zealots across the map because zealots are quick at pulling back and attacking That way you keep all your high value targets at home, your immortals, your colossi, even your stalkers And if there's nothing there, if your opponent is bad and didn't build anything, your salads will kill a base and will kill everything However, if there is stuff there, you can just pull back the salads and your situation is still fine That way you get the best of both worlds You got very lucky And that's not allowed I despise you for it So don't do that again Plus three being researched, good call. I don't really like the colossi that is being built here for the simple reason that you've seen that there's like 12 corruptors This is kind of like starting a colossi transition while your opponent has 16 useless Vikings It's like it just doesn't make much sense He already has the counter ready and you are still kind of tacking into that colossi count Like these colossi are also going to get taken out now your third Colossi is going to show up and is also just going to die What do you think was going to happen? Like, what is the best case scenario that happens here? That he sees the recall animation and he thinks, oh, he's recalling Let me just go away. Like, there's not a second here in which he can't attack the Colossi He can attack them while they're idling And he can attack them while they're idling from the recall Look, they never stop They just have to turn their head a little bit if the Colossi actually finish the recall If you wanted to recall, why didn't you just recall into the natural where your stalkers were? That would have made a lot more sense Your zeal has had a good job, though, and I do like that In this type of scrappy situation, I'd always recommend a dark shrine as well I really do like that as a recommendation. I'd also like to make you aware right now that you have known that there is a spire for quite a long time, but you don't know if there's a hive or not And I think you were complaining a lot about how can I possibly transition into having any type of anti-air in such a short notice? And I believe that the spire finished at the 10 minute mark And this is the first time that you're starting some type of investment into your anti-air with the blink The first time, and even now you're not chronoing it You're just still taking it slow You've seen that there was 10 mutas Now you see 10 corruptors. You have no clue what your opponent is doing tech-wise, whether there's a greater spires So one spire, one greater spire, one for the upgrades Now he's moving out You know he still has corruptors So I really do like that you're getting blink I still feel like that's a little bit late Once again, you get caught halfway on the map And I just kind of want to look at this Like, if you don't have a reason to be on the map, you should couldn't be on the map. This is a little bit like in World War I, you know, when you had all the them trenches and stuff, if there was no good reason to pop your head above the trench, you'd stay in the trench That's what you make the trenches for You should be standing next to a Nexus with a battery, unless you have a goal while being on the map or you want to achieve something, whether that is a distraction or sending some zealots around, then that's fine. but what could possibly be your goal at this point? You know your opponent has freaking 10 corruptors, and you also, well, I'm not quite sure if you know, but you should have known that there's also an army that's probably twice the size of yours on the ground What is the point of being here right now? There's no point you should have been defending You're mining, you have good upgrades, you need to be spending your money right now and sending out Zellat run bys to try and pray that your opponent never attacks you and that he stays busy with chasing Zellets all around the map Instead, you get caught halfway on the map You lose your colossal. You lose all your stalkers, which coincidentally also is all of your anti-air You still don't have any batteries or cannons here either Still believing that all these peace treaties that you're signing with the aggressive Zerk will work out eventually This run by once again, absolutely fabulous If at the same time six zealots would be over here, you would be denying majority of his mining He'd be mining on one base, basically 12 mineral patches That would have been fantastic You actually would be out mining him by mining here and in your natural, which honestly is great Once again, you have no static defense here whatsoever and it's pissing me off. These zealots, at this point I'd say, just send all of them into your opponent's third or into their natural That's exactly what you do And that is once again the correct call I'm not quite sure about attacking the extractor here, but I'll let it be for now Your nexus here is still up, and you're actually defending the ground army. these zealots are idling honestly except for eating these biles the past 25 seconds have not been so bad by you I really do like what you did there moving back to the cannon as well defensive position there's some Brutlords on the way right at this moment now these zealots should be trying to deny as much eco as possible you're still mining your opponent isn't attacking the hatch doesn't do too much but if you can kill the freaking like 12 20 more drones you're going to completely be out mining your opponent Here you control ball Did you actually try to eat that bile? I didn't know that it wouldn't hit Look at this You see the. I want to see this in slow motion, actually And zoomed in Look at this So he starts hitting this pylon Then he biles the pylon Here, here And as you see the bile, you start moving this stalker in it And I think you believe that you're actually going to catch it Look how how hard you're pushing for this But luckily that is not how the hitbox works, apparently And you get out Now, you get six Brutlords into this little area Your zealots are dying to broodlings on the other side rather than killing any of these bases And now there is one very clear plan for me that would probably win you the game, and that is by just attacking him. Okay? It is obvious to you and to me that this one immortal and the five stalkers will not be capable of blinking into six broodlords with plus two attack while the broodlings have plus three attack okay that is just not going to happen so what you do instead is you send your entire army across the map and kill everything that they have at home forcing either the brute lords to go home and defend or allowing you this would be even better allowing you to clear all of their eco while you're still mining and then eventually either getting Dark Templar or getting enough void race to just straight up win the game. However, what you do is you defend with six Stalkers and an Immortal at nexus and you lose all your Zealots on the other side of the map to his superiorly upgraded Lings and Roaches. I'm not saying you necessarily would have won with the Stalkers and Immortals, but I believe you would have had a very good chance of actually winning. Even at this point, I mean, there's what, 13 Lings and two Roaches. You warp in five, six Zealots over here you go and have a fight. I mean, yeah, really have a decent chance. He's going to take absolute ages to deal with your entire production. And the great thing about how slow Broodlord kills stuff is that it also allows you to respond quickly. So you can build gateways over here or Stargates over here, once again, only sending out the zealots rather than the rest of the army Like, what is the point of the army here? If you want to defend this base, just build a battery and a cannon and then pray that he doesn't send anything but link Like, a warpin can also defend If you had actually, he has nothing He literally has one roach in defense and you have two zealots That is it If these units were here, you would be killing all of his eco, and he wouldn't have been allowed to build anything anymore Well, he wouldn't be able to afford it no more. I just don't understand why this army is staying home You're saving up stalkers, but your opponent is currently outmining you So you're getting a, what we come all not even really a counter I mean, Brutlords, especially in numbers this large, actually beat the Hawkers So you're not really getting anything done Your opponent is growing stronger while you are growing weaker And you're not tacking into any type of better tech that will allow you to win this game Like, perhaps Voidreys Oh, you're getting a Stargate now That is at least the one good thing I do like that But because your opponent is mining so much, you can just continuously produce corruptors There's nine corruptors right now. I mean, A single void ray is good and I know a lot of people, especially Zerkes out there, will believe that one void ray maybe can take out nine corruptors but especially if the nine corruptors have plus two That is not actually the case Let me tell you that Okay Why aren't we continuing with this and warping in four more zealots? Why didn't we do this half an hour ago? Taking out this base and this base I don't understand it Obviously you know it's possible but you just decided not to do it Also here You know exactly what your opponent's army consists of You've seen these six Brutelords for the past three minutes You can't beat it with this Okay, it's not possible. You know this, I know this You can't Why would you not just try to do something else, like trying to base rate, rather than straight up attacking into this position, which you know 100% isn't going to work? You had nine stalkers against six Brutlords with plus two, with three two, on the broodlings as well These broodlings are going to be insanely powerful And there was links on the ground as well Why didn't you just try to base rate? Try to somehow win Well, I guess because your decision making hasn't been that brilliant Maybe just a little bit impaired because of these glasses of wine that you had been drinking. Let's just try to break this down, okay, into a few, you know, bite-sized chunks here So the first part is the opener and the build order You kind of scolded your opponent for having his hatchery three seconds late, and then you completely overbid that by delaying your own cybernetic score by 50 seconds Your early game really was quite terrible Also, if you're going to cannon rush, obviously, pylon and the forge, both should be downstairs or on top of the ramp So that also was in this day You end up throwing down four pylons before your own nexus you go into plus one, into four gates, into a robo, and then armor upgrade. Like, your entire early game build order honestly just felt improvised, and it's the bad type of improvisation You know, it's not Eric Clapton It's like a guy that's been playing guitar for two and a half hours and can play only the top string so far It's not going to sound very good, my friend And this also didn't look very good Let me tell you if you don't know what you're doing in the early game, there is no shame in admitting that and just copying something from someone else This is not like copying homework Well, it kind of is But I'd rather have you copy someone else's homework than make up your own garbage. Or just copy the history book or whatever if you're in history class, rather than making up your own history because that's kind of what you're doing here It just doesn't fuel, right? So for the build order, you're going to get a massive, uh-uh, that ain't it, chief That's not a positive thing when it ain't it Secondly, your map vision and your overall scouting was, well, I think, unrateable as it was completely non-existent You had no vision of your opponent's army ever You had no vision of your opponent's bases, your opponent's tech, your opponent's drone count The only thing you did have vision of pretty consistently was your opponent's creep So you were very well aware of about two or three creep tumour. at almost every point in the game And that might sound useful to you, but to me, that was completely useless, and I would recommend not focusing too much on the creep and more on other things that could give you clues as to what's actually happening in the game You didn't realize there was a spire for five minutes You had no clue about the greater spire You didn't know whether your opponent was going to attack you the first time You had no clue whether your opponent was going to attack you the second time You got caught off guard in the middle of the map, like twice You got caught off guard while sitting at home because you had no clue your opponent was attacking. like your scouting was complete garbage and for that you're going to get a big hard not good enough my friend your macro overall i actually didn't pay too much attention to it but it felt fine you were spending your money reasonably well better than your opponents at most points but because your your eco was so much worse and your entire build order sucked it didn't really seem to matter but for your macro you know you'll barely pass for that i'll give you like one of the sideway ones, you know, and not the surfer sideway ones Like, that's cool, but more like, it's all right, but it's not brilliant Put it all together, my friend. And it's not zirk that is too powerful with the quick tech switches into air, which are impossible to counter, but it is you who sucks And that is the truth of the matter All right That's going to be it for today Thanks all so much for watching I hope you did enjoy it If you did, don't forget to the like button, subscribe to the channel And hopefully I'll see all of you next time for a new video Thank you and bye bye."

        "text": "Dear Harstam, I've recently come across the fact that the Zirk race is absolutely stupid Corruptors cost two supply, while a carrier costs six The math doesn't simply hold up There's also the legendary lurker, which has about 400 of HP and 80 damage This is an exaggeration by the author of this imbalance complaint form Late game is simply unplayable The Zerk has more money, more efficient units, and vipers make me want to cannon rush every single Zerg, every single game That's not to mention spore crawlers, which are pretty much free and cost zero supply. Maybe we could just try finishing the game before that, huh? Well, I guess not, since Zirk has the Revager and a baboon can send links cross-map to make you go back to your base whenever you try to do something on the map What do you think? Is it Rimbab or do I suck? Name Shakti, race, protos, league grandmaster, and the server is an A I'm a little bit surprised by this form for a couple of reasons First of all, we have a Protos complaining about Zirk late game I usually get the reverse Second of all, Shakti used to be a Zerk player. So for the people that don't know Shakti, is a Brazilian player that I thought was a Zerk player, but apparently recently or well maybe in the past 10 years has switched to Protos I remember Shakti as a Zirk player because in the Intel Extreme Master Sao Paulo 2013 or 2014, one of the two, Shakti managed to take out Hello Kitty Hello Kitty was an American Protos player who played for the same team as I was playing at the time, which was fanatic And he went to Sao Paulo and got last in his group and he lost to Shakti I remember that because I had never heard of Shakti before, and Shakti took out one of my teammates. So it was a bit of a shock Let's put it like that So the first thing I would say is that if you truly believe that the other race is imbalanced, perhaps change, switch back You know, you know how to play it from back in the day It shouldn't be too much of an issue But on the other hand, Shakti made the honorable move of swapping from Zerk to Protos and maybe he wants to keep the moral high ground Maybe he wants to feel good about himself Maybe he doesn't want to feel dirty every day And no matter how much he showers, the nastiness won't come off because he still plays Zerk on a high level. If that's the case, then of course you can stick to playing Protos And instead we'll just actually focus on what you ask And that is whether this is imbalanced or if you suck Now, in order to research this claim, we'll be looking pretty tightly at everything you'll be doing I mean, this is Grand Master level The standards are high here You're playing against a player called Grasfren, which I have never heard of Your opener is a gate scout, which means you can't block your opponents natural The only scenario in which this is okay is if you actually play Showtime's build order, which is the four-adapt double or triple Oracle, I think it is, with a fast robo into Forge Twilight. This is the only scenario where I kind of like it I don't know why I like it there, but Showtime does it, so it must be good I know that is a bit of a fallacy, but I don't really care If Showtime does something, I generally believe he has his reasons for it And Showtime, whenever he plays that specific Oracle build, almost always opens up with a Gate Scout rather than blocking the opponent's natural Whenever I talk with Showtime, I don't completely agree with him on that point, but he does it and Shelton is fantastic So this is really the only strat I would, you know, I would allow this for Otherwise, always block your opponents natural, especially the lower level you get. So at the very top, Zirk players are super optimized And they know exactly what to do when they get blocked, when to build drones, where to send their links, how to move their queens But just even slightly below that top level, very often if you block your opponents natural and you chronobust out two adepts and send them across the map, it allows you to just deal so much damage and often get a lead that might just be able to kind of translate it into a game later on It gets you a lead that you can leverage into the midgame into a quick win Instead, we see you just shade in 36. So you lost 70 shields on this one adapt and also, what is it, 34 of your actual, your view HP You lost 100, you took 100 damage sniping a single creep tumor so far Good job, buddy Real nice control Your opponent immediately pulls away You walk away from your safe space, which is over here You could have moved back towards this little safe space that you have, but instead you move into the links trying to chase drones And what do you get? You get a single tumor and a single link for two adepts This is the worst trait that I've ever seen with two adepts in my entire life That's very impressive because I've worked are a crapton of StarCraft. Second Oracle is on the way, and you're actually playing the 4-Adeb builder So I actually do like your build order I just don't like your unit movement so far This Oracle should be back home because it should be cleaning up these links rather than moving across the map You actually do that Okay, that's good It's a little bit late, and at this point your second Oracle is already out Your third base should be going down at this point, honestly, rather than in five, six seconds from now. Once again, we're being quite critical of shock But the reason for that is because he is A, he's an ex-pro player or still a pro player, or at least a very high-level player, and B, he's in Grandmaster So this guy definitely needs to know how to play the game And delaying your nexus by 10, 15 seconds for no reason Yeah, that's quite a big error, actually, at a high level Spore is weirdly positioned Did you just take literally, when is it, 54 damage on this Oracle for no reason? Once again, a lot of damage for no reason You're also completely broadcasting every move with the oracle that you're making by staying in your opponent's vision. You're even idling in your opponent's vision, completely allowing the Zirk player to move the queens in the correct position to deal with these oracles This is extremely impressive what I'm seeing here The Zirk is defending quite well You also target four different drones here You lose one Oracle for free You lose two oracles for free Okay So so far you have killed two drones, three links and one creep tumor, and you've lost two adapts and two oracles Your entire opener is kind of focused on dealing drone damage to your opponents with early two chrono boosted adapts, with fast three oracles The entire purpose of the Oracle is to kill drones and to get information. If you're this bad with Oracle control, I'd recommend playing Voidray openers rather than playing a triple Oracle opener It just really doesn't make any sense to play this If you're constantly flying into your opponent's vision, you're tanking damage for free for no reason Like, what is this? Like, if you wanted to become like a figure skater or something like that, then you should have been practicing for that But with an Oracle, you want to deal damage Like, it's not the same No one's going to give you points for a perfect spin in your opponent's creep or something like that I also like aesthetically pleasing things and I like beautiful circles and that type of stuff. But this is not the time with the Oracle, my friend Your follow-up is going to be Blink I know for a fact that Showtime doesn't play this because he's not an idiot So you copy part of his build order You lose two oracles to adapts And then you follow it up with Blink If Showtime is still awake at this hour, then he's probably screaming out loud He hates this. blink again Zirk is only good in one scenario no yeah in one scenario it's a very specific scenario it's good in the scenario where your opponent doesn't have a brain has no scouting whatsoever and took 25 drone damage in the early game but none of these scenarios happened on top of that you're also executing the what give one second you're Okay, you open up with, I'm just really confused I knew the NA letter wasn't too hot, but this is really pushing it So you rush out nine gateways, a prism, blink, and plus one All of these are investments for the super short term Blink stalkers fall off insanely hard The moment there's more than three revergers, the moment there's any amount of banlings. Just the moment there's any there's any unit that isn't just a pure roach or a pure link, the stalker sentry combination against Zirk is hot garbage It's not even funny how bad it is You invest at 500 gas in centuries You're building nine gateways, blink, all of this purely for a bling, and the prism, all of this for a blink stalker attack And then the moment that you worked up to arrives, you take a fort base, you throw down three extra pilots, you get a Stargate and a fleet beacon Then why did you get the nine gateways and the blink and the five sentries? Gas is the most scarce resource for Protos in the entire game, and you're just wasting it right now. You could have had three Arcons at this point, which actually would have been a useful unit going into a longer game Are you just going to be playing defensive stalker sentry here? This has to be the worst thing I've seen in my entire life What a terrible build order The worst part is that you probably thought it was so smart as well, and that's what pisses me off even more It's like, ah, the sentries and the stalkers for defense and I go into carriers Like, if you want to defend and do absolutely nothing, you build void rays and disruptors We figured this out years ago, mate Like, we really have figured this out years and years and years ago. This is like showing up in the year like 1900 and being happy that you invented the wheel This is how late you are with this build Like we played this in 2012, and even back then we realized it was complete crap That is not completely true During the entirety of Heart of the Swarm, Stalker Sentry was pretty good But then we wouldn't go into Fast Carrier Just this entire idea of trying to defend with Sentry Stalker into a late game, it just doesn't really work Sentry Stalker is inherently an aggressive composition, and thus needs to be used aggressively It's an army that wants to fight on the map, deny creep And, well, it just isn't that good as well. Like, but if you're going to get it, at least go hard on it and only build stalker sentry and you need to all in with it Then eventually transition into Disruptor or something like that and pretend that you can still play a game I can't remember last time I really saw Mess Stalker work unless the ProDos had a massive advantage I think Astrella Lombo on Blackburn might have been the case, but still It's not even remotely similar to whatever monstrosity it is that you're producing here Like this is complete crap It's not a small crap, you know? This one is freaking 10 Kourix or something like that This is a big crap I do not like the way this looks. This Oracle is going to revelate at least Well It's not going to revelate I wonder if you actually did anything with it these oracles The first two oracles got given up for free You killed like three workers, I guess So you paid basically 300 resources per drone, 150 minerals, 150 gas to kill one drone with, because I think you kill three workers total Very cool All right, you scout this drop and you start warping in some stalkers There's probably a good call I like that a fair I wouldn't even mind if you get like a cannon here or something like that or you send one of your carriers over there I mean, you have three of them. If there's drops on the way, you might want to do something like that Forget to leave a, oh, this is a good warpin, actually That was just in time All right Now that we've talked enough about your initial build order, let's just forget about that, okay, and just kind of judge the situation for what it is right now So at this point, you have a, honestly, you have a decent army You just got there in a weird way Okay, you have a decent army plus 10 stalkers, which of course are completely useless, but we'll get, we've already handled that So I don't want to, you know, kind of stick around there Four sentries also not great. At this point, I would suggest clearing some creep and trying to see what type of comp your opponent is going for So you want to know, hey, I'm playing against corruptors Am I playing against a queen infestor? Or in this case, am I playing against Lurker? And do I kind of just get handed to free win to me? The Lurker generally is considered the weakest option out of all the Zirk options, especially once carriers are out The lurker can only really defend one area It doesn't attack air either So yeah, it's not a brilliant unit This is the type of harass that I love to see. I think you send in eight zealots to kill an extractor and then kill another two and a half hydras It's nice to see that you really care about being efficient with every unit that you build First with the oracles now with the zealids It is a treat watching you control harassment units, my friend Shakti It kind of makes sense, though, if you used to be a Zirk player This is how Zerk players also control their units Whoa! That's one Rcon Very cool That actually was a very good abducta of him as well Now, a good trick to not get abducted as much, and this is a pretty high-level trick, is using the Oracle revelation on your opponent's vipers. Now, this sounds difficult, but in reality, you just need to cast a spell like once every, what is it, 18 or every 20 seconds, and you practically have a map hack of where your opponent's vipers are You can do this with like three oracles or something like that, and you'll never get abducted again unless you get caught slightly out of position At least it becomes a lot harder for you to get abducted You're kind of blind as well at this point You have a prism in the middle of the map I'm not quite sure if this is cosplaying as an observer, or if you just want to reinforce this position later on in the game It's difficult to say what your plans are. Because, yeah, so far I'm not really sure if you have a plan or if things are just happening accidentally And sometimes they're good and sometimes they're bad, you know? It's kind of like playing roulette Because right now playing roulette, you did this while playing StarCraft too Sometimes everything as well, sometimes everything sucks These carriers will start working on this carrier Hello, carriers, start working on this lurker, I assume No? just wanted to spot it, make sure it stays in the ground real nice over there Oh, you kill the stalker That's good Don't need those stalkers anyway Good job, Mr Lurker We'll send you a couple more later. How is it possible that this Lurker is still going, by the way? There's literally nothing going on in the game What are you looking at? Okay, you're looking at your main army You get the notification on the bottom right Are you just giving up the base? Is it like, oh, that's too much to deal with? No There we go Okay, so you do deal with it eventually It only took you about half a minute Oracle is out as well You have a couple of voidreys on the way This is kind of relaxing It's the APM here 265 It's not even that bad It just don't do a whole lot. Against Lurkers, one of the key objectives is to pull your opponent out of position through aggressive rotations, especially once your opponent takes a sixth base Very often that is quite easy We can for example imagine this general area as an avenue avenue of attack for the Protos We position our entire army here This forces the Zerk player with his Lurker Hydra army to make a decision, hey, do I defend this area? Do I defend this area? Or do I split up my army? Now, if the Zerk player splits up his army, that means that both parts are going to be relatively weak. And then you can start moving towards the right side, try and get this army to move a bit to that position If the Zerk picks this base to defend, you have the left side base to attack If the Zerk picks the left side base to defend, you have the right side base to attack So you always want to be looking at these kind of key locations where the Zerk will have a difficult time spreading his army And that's where you want to attack from The worst angle that you can take would be from here because this is a really easy angle to cover The Zirc could just position its army here and would completely shut off this area. Even this middle area, I'm not a huge fan of So you always kind of want to be walking on towards that far left side Taking out these rocks could be useful, but don't forget that whenever you take out rocks, that also opens up a path for your opponent to attack you So it's not like a one-sided affair I like that you're using revelation, but obviously we need to see that revelation on the vipers more than anything else The lurkers are a static unit, well, it's a siege unit and will not move too much They will not catch a carrier, okay? There's not a single lurker that has killed a carrier, yeah Not in my time of playing StarCraft too. And the carriers really are the key in your army So what you want to be doing is making sure that your carrier stay alive and the best way is to have vision of your opponent's vipers Not of these two spores, not of the lurkers, no, of the vipers Because the vipers are going to be responsible for all the out-of-fight damage So whenever you're not fighting, the only unit that can kill something is the viper During a fight, of course, you might want to revelate these lurkers because it's important to see them But out-of-fight, you want to revelate the vipers So far I think you've lost three Arcons, maybe one or two Arcons and one carry or something like that. They're still just moving into the same area again and again No real aggressive rotations yet I do like that you're building a lot of cannons I genuinely think that is good I wouldn't mind seeing a Templar here either And another cool trick against Lurker is the mothership So let's first wait this fight before I start giving you some more solid advice Okay, so you lost three carriers there and you killed maybe one corruptor, I think He's rebuilding three corruptors Didn't lose any of the Vipers, gets the transfuse Now, these are obviously not good traits because he's trading energy against your carriers. And on top of that, whenever you lose carriers, you need to wait a long time for you to get completely maxed again Carriers take 64 seconds, even with the two chronobo boosts that still will be 44 seconds So that's a long time in which you're not maxed Losing three carriers at the same time kind of sucks You're also not continuing your shield upgrades or your armor, your air armor upgrades Now, let me get back to that mothership idea, okay? So a cool thing against lurkers, once again, is that they can't be in multiple places at the same time and they can't fly. That means that if you're at a position where the lurker isn't siegeed yet, it's really difficult for them to settle down So if you're attacking this and the lurkers still need to come in, that is quite hard for them and they can't immediately start fighting because they first need to burrow and everything This is why the mothership is so useful If you have a mothership on the far right side and your army moves over here or over here, most likely the lurkers will position themselves over here and maybe into this position That means that the entire right side is open You recall your main army to the right side You clear the spores and then you just kill this base. Rinse and repeat this forever until you kill every single side This forces the lurker player to stay on a very compact base layout Rather than taking eight, seven bases, at the same time, they're forced to take a very small amount of bases And that's exactly what we're not seeing here Because you're just continuously attacking the same side I don't think you've once rotated towards the left You've rotated from here to this location And once again, this location is completely shut off by just a single measure of these lurkers moving in positions What is this fight? I don't even understand how you can lose fights like this I need to watch this again You have eight carriers Okay. You have, he has 16 corruptors, right? I love that these sentries don't even use forcefield either So you lose all your sentries, then you lose your Arcon and all your Templar Not a single spell has been cast on these Templar Look at that Literally nothing Not even a feedback or anything So you lose all your Templar, all your ground goes down, and you killed two vipers and a couple of Lurkers I don't even understand how that's possible You literally just move commanded your Templar into Lurker Yeah, the Lurker is genuinely quite a good unit if you send Templar into them to eat But the beauty of the lurkers is that it can't chase you that easily It's a seizing unit. It holds a position You don't have to walk into it Maybe a revolutionary concept for you, but to me this seems quite obvious Whenever you want to fight, this type of fight, try to keep the Templar in a position where they can perhaps feed back vipers Or just throw down one storm on a charge chunk of lurkers and then throw them further towards the back So you just throw one storm and then move away That way it won't die, but it still will deal some damage to lurkers The main thing, of course, is that you don't really want to be attacking into a position that is already set up. If you see that there's 16 lurkers set up and there's 10 spores there as well, perhaps it's a good idea to try and attack somewhere else rather than straight up attacking into the same location five more times Like, this rotation is also completely useless Just, I hate having to go back in the replay every single time, but you just attack him here Okay This is the location you attack him in Your rotation is to walk all the way towards the bottom here, move up this ramp, and then go here. Your aggressive rotation takes almost 14, 15 seconds, while his defensive rotation takes a second and a half because all he needs to do for you to walk 15 seconds around is to unburrow five lurkers and put them over here His spores are already in position as well and it just makes no sense On top of that, what you're doing by giving up position in the middle is you're making yourself vulnerable on a base like this, on a base like this Your entire center is open Whenever you're making rotations, you often want to keep the sides open because these are easy to defend because you can usually cut them off with a single cannon position The middle is way harder Look at this. If these lurkers go into the middle, they could go into the natural, they could go into this base, they could go behind this base, they could go over here, while the sides are way easier to cover So what you want to do is with your movement is either you have a very good aggressive move or you try and keep the center while you're trying to poke for holes Here, What would have been a better play from here on out is to just walk, pop, pop over here And even just being here, forces the Zirk player to have lurkers on the left side and lurkers on the right side That means that the lurkers are already split. And with a lurker count of 12, that means six lurkers on each side, two lurkers at home as well So that means five lurkers on each side Actually, there's some random lurkers sprawled around in other base as well It's probably going to be like three or four lurkers on each side Like, that's almost nothing That is a completely different type of game rather than fighting the eight lurkers right over here And this move is just so stupid It really just makes absolutely zero sense to me I don't understand how you can be 5 5K MMR without understanding how an aggressive rotation works or what the point of movement in this game is Like it is so extremely obvious to Look. What is he doing? Like This guy is probably just a surprised as I am here, that you once again decide to attack in here You attack into a position where the majority of his lurkers are, where all of his spores are, and where all of his air is as well You clump up your carriers on top of one another while they're being parasitic bombed You clump up the void race as well, and then you're surprised that you lose the fight Yeah, no crap If I put a knife in my leg, I wouldn't be surprised that I bleed That is kind of the, you know, it follows from putting the knife in my knife my leg It's the same here. If you don't micro your units and you attack into a siege-up position with a creptone of static, most likely you're going to lose the fight Now you warp in stalkers against lurkers And honestly, the stalkers wouldn't have even been completely useless if you would have at least targeted on the corruptors But attacking into lurkers is like suicide The lurker is practically the hard counter to the stalker It makes me sad to see that It really does make me sad to see this Any other unit, but the stalker would have been fantastic here What makes me even sadder is that it's working, because that kind of legitimizes your beliefs here I think I hate that even more than This is a terrible fight. There's no shot that you actually watch this replay, right? You're down 10k in resources lost I didn't even know that was possible I think I could fight fights with my eyes closed and have better resources lost than you do I don't even need to storm You could just aim with an Airtov's army an Airtos army and have better fights than you This is really crazy to watch I often joke about negative micro, but I don't think negative quite covers it This is like Kelvin levels of micro It's like so far below zero Like this is cold, my friend This is awful Okay, your opponent gets a couple of lurkers Stalkers, blink, for it. I do like some of the moves that you're making here with the Do I? Let me go back here Okay, so at this point you have a lot of stalkers You have a little bit of momentum behind you You're outmining your opponent in a significant way You're up 20 workers So, at this point, you're not really much not really maxed out You have a lot of supply in production structures, but you know your opponent also had a lot of supplying corruptors So maybe this isn't even that bad That blink forward isn't great because that doesn't allow you to run away anymore And if you get surrounded, that could be annoying. These stalkers also aren't joining up with the main army, which kind of sucks All of these stalkers kind of just get blasted here, I guess There's a couple of observers with that army Yeah, it wasn't a good trade It really wasn't a good trade It was a terrible trade It still doesn't, it still feels fine for you honestly Like, despite everything that you've done wrong this game, which is a lot You're still in a position where you're up in income Sorry, where you're up in income, you have good enough tech to really win this game at any point You have map control, you're clearing creep and stuff like that It's really not that bad Your opponent can never really catch you. I mean, he has seven lurkers and 27 corruptors Hey, this is one of these things as well Like, I understand if this happens at like, in like lower level games where people just don't think and they just, they're like, oh, I like the void right That's a cool unit But you're a grand master player You have a mass stalker army Your opponent currently has seven lurkers and 26 corruptors You know your opponent is practically broke and has an inferior economy Why would you build the one unit that he already has a counter against? That just doesn't make any sense Disruptors at this point, immortals, zealot, Arcon, Storm, adapts, everything at this point would be better than void race. because all of these unit would contribute to attacking the weakest part of his army, which is the anti-ground army His anti-air army is insanely strong But his anti-ground is almost non-existent And worst of all, it's pure lurker So why would you continue with your void ray production? No, you transition out You don't always have to go back to void race It's not necessary It is bad boy The Cirque believed that there was going to be an observer I scared to have a living crap out of him I really did There's still a lot of money for you in the bank, so like a single zealot warpin or something like that This should be a good fight I think Super Battery Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is a good fight I like that fight I like that you two get a fight Okay, maybe we can micro this Maybe Maybe nicely into two spores So only lost one void ray in the end because the parasitic bomb ran out But I feel like Yeah, okay, you pulled them back Good job Nice Get some Arconnes I like that you now recognize that void rays are not going to be the answer Although void rays are not the answer, I still don't think we should be throwing them away for free into a wall of spores But that might just be me being crazy here This is a difficult fight to lose, but the one way you could lose is by not having detection. So I think the Oracle call here is very good I also like that you're quick to realize that attacking into lurkers without having detection isn't that useful So you quit it immediately It's an interesting blink forward This is the type of game as well where I think like a zealot run by towards the left side is super useful Because literally all he has is a couple of lurkers to defend with The void race, you can kind of keep them at home for defense against like lurker runbys Well, hello? Where's the detection? Oh no Okay, we move up a ramp here We're kind of cornering ourselves right now Another Oracle gets sniped here That means we don't have detect. Okay, this is an interesting call He could have also walked into the main base, stayed on top of the ramp and then maybe recalled majority of his army but I guess losing 12 stalkers and getting damage on all your arcons might be considered a better play by Shakti into losing all your arcons I can't believe these Vipers actually dealing damage it's crazy Shakti still is ahead here this salad run by is quite good I like it it's hard to believe but he's really still ahead at this point because the majority of the army consists of corruptors the only thing Shakti needs to do is buy time And, wait, did he build former Void Race? Stop with the Void Race, for real dude. It's by time and get like disruptors out or just an immortal army Like, just anything that, that is good in the ground So basically just not stalkers Like everything but stalkers would be fantastic here It really would be That's another good move command Really do like that Do you say you have detection? Okay, yeah, it does have detection It's not going to be a good fight, is it? Okay, double parasitic bombs So all the void rays that he built in the past two and a half minutes get absolutely blasted There's still 17 corruptors left over And the entire ground army gets blasted Gigi I'm not even sure if that's necessary here There's 16 lurkers. There is a bit much, maybe, to fight at this point But, I mean, there's so many cannons here You still have decent mining on the left side You have good mining over here You have full mining in this base, full mining in this base You have 1700 in the bank You could send in a zealot, sell-it run by with like an observer or with one of your two oracles to clear this base You could take out the layer for practically free I don't think this was over, but I also don't think you would have won it I just think it required someone with more than double-digit IQ to win this game Okay. I'm just going to go read through your claims again because it is all a bit much for me So you talk about sport crawlers which are pretty much free and cost zero supply You say you can't finish the game Okay, people do this a lot They say maybe you could just try finishing the game before we get into the late game, but it's not possible because Zirk has a reverger and you can send links across the map to make you go back to your base This type of stuff I don't really like if it doesn't happen in the game Like, you can't simulate some game in your head and then tell me about it. You'd be like, well, in my mind, if I attack him with a stalker push, you'll just push me back and I can't win So I'm forced into this Like, in that case, you'd first need to show me that that actually happens and that is impossible to attack and that there's no player in the world that attack Zerk before they get into Lurker-Viper Spore Like, the one thing that Zirks don't like about the Viper is, isn't even necessarily that they die with it There's the fact that they need to stay super compact in general and that they need to build a lot of roaches in the early game to survive. And the roach is just a unit that as Zirk, you usually don't really want to be building because it falls off so hard So they need to throw it away somehow You didn't even try to attack So you're not allowed to complain about Zerk being too strong defunders defensively Like if you sit on your bomb all day, building cannons, void race carriers and a couple of stalkers for whatever reason, you don't get to complain about that That's not cool Your build order, so let's just do this systematically Okay, so we have your build order, your midgame, I guess, and then we'll take a look at your overall decision making and your little attack paths that you took. Your early game and your build order honestly was quite good I liked your first five minutes until you started blink I actually think everything you did up until that point was practically perfect build order-wise Unit control, not so much You lost all the harassment units And I think that is an issue in the, when you're playing a build that is very harass intensive With oracles, adapt and all that type of stuff, you need to be good with them So you either need to practice that a lot or you just give up and you start playing void ray openers because you don't have to be as active with those on the map. They're kind of fine by themselves, clearing an overlord here and there, taking out a hatchery, something like that So I like the build order I didn't like the execution Your midgame, I don't really want to talk about You build stalkers while tacking into fleet beacons You would have died against any decent queen walk because there were no disruptors You would have died against any decent roachmax Pretty sure you also would have died against swarm host, Hydra Lingbane, maybe Lingbane Queen. they honestly you seemed safe against absolutely nothing and you set yourself up for a bad midgame push as well usually we do these pushes with like three to six carriers these days you had no possibility to do it you had like 10 minutes with seven carriers hey that's this is really quite bad so that entire part I didn't like then I said yeah on that you you're got awful garbage hot trash whatever you want to put there it's all awful not good then the way that you attacked and the way you use your army is I think where I had the most issues with your entire play, with everything you did basically You kept attacking into the same angles again and again. You never even threatened once to attack the left side of the map You were continuously moving on the right side and also the same angles there again and again and again Once a Lurker player is set up, he's set up and you can't just walk in there with Templar and try to storm it and right click on sports You got parasitic bombed every single fight Your splits were god-awful You lost more Templars than I can count on my 10 fingers and my 10 toes combined That's 20 So it's a lot of Templar you lost their body You lost so many oracles You constantly lost observers into spores You lost void rays into spores. It really looked like you were trying your best to lose the game And then when you succeeded, you got upset So for the neutral spectator who watched that game, it felt like you were trying to throw or someone paid you to fix this ladder match or something like that And then you send this balance complaint at the end It makes absolutely no sense to me because you tried your absolute best to lose it Yeah, your attack pads genuinely sucked The Lurker also, out of all the units that the ZERC can build, I think it's generally one of the worst units. It's really difficult to use for the Zerk against a Skytos army you really require good control with corruptor viper you need decent creep spread you need good spore movement and good understanding of where to defend honestly the Zerg is completely outplayed you my friend this had nothing to do with Zirk being imbalanced and everything to do with you sucking that's going to be it you suck all right that actually is going to be it for today's episode of Is It Inba or Do I Suck if you have another proto's that gets kicked into the bin Thanks all so much for watching I hope you did enjoy this episode And if you did, don't forget to like but subscribe to the channel.

        "text": "Hey Harstam Well in this game my first push was a little late I had more units than it usually has and didn't do too badly with it Everything else was on point Then as the game goes on I multitask really hard, attacking with multiple armies in different locations at the same time, while spending my money well behind it My upgrades also were really on point, giving me a lead in every fight I even had more workers than him in a TVZ He did two tech switches The first one from Ling Bain into Hydra Corruptor, which I reacted to by building less marauders and more Marines, because, you know, marauders have less DPS versus hydras and can't even attack corruptors. But then, all of a sudden, boom! He switched into mass ultras, and obviously my Marines die and I lose the game He forgets to build units after this, so I ran over the map and kill a bunch of stuff instead of leaving because I didn't know the game was over yet I am sorry for that Now, the question, is it imba or do I suck? Name Clem from Wish, race, Terran, League, Platinum, Server, EU At 2 9K MMR here, we have a Terran player complaining about the imbalanced TVZ matchup and basically saying that he was very on point this game. right my macro was very good my upgrades were very good my multitasking was not just very good it was perfect practically multitasking many times at different locations at the same time with different armies now whenever i get a message like this from a what was he platinum from a platinum player i always get a little bit afraid i have yet to see the first platinum player actually manages to control units in more than one location Hell, I'm gonna up that statement I am yet to see a Platinum player control his units properly in a single location, let alone more than one It is really difficult in StarCraft 2 to control your army well. It is so difficult that probably 80 to 90% of the StarCraft population don't even know what controlling an army well looks like except when they watch clips of Clam or Maru do it or, I don't know, other players that have good control that I can't currently think of But for whatever reason, Clem from Wish here, with the perfect control in multiple locations at the same time, still loses to a Zirk player that is 2 9K MMR That is honestly quite wild So I'm really looking forward to this If you read that balance complaint for him, you'd figure that we're watching the most perfect player in the world And so far, I kind of like this build or a reactor first. Could be going into a triple wrecks here Could go into something like a four, six marine into a helium push Those are really the two main option But because he's still mining extra gas, it most likely is going to be a factory opener is what I would say if this was a very high-level player But because most players below masters don't actually care too much about optimizing mineral mining, it is still possible that he'll go into three racks I always like to keep my options open during these iotuses because I've seen some wild stuff, you know, people taking two gas, floating 500 gas, and then getting a third CC before their second barracks It's like, all right, buddy. This is obviously not going to be it Go into like the five minute mark They have 900 gas in the bank 23 workers, although they have triple-CC It's like, oops Okay, it's actually going to be a three-recks He builds both barracks at the same time Usually not quite what you want to be doing, as the money doesn't come in at the same time, right? It's not like you go from zero to 300, all of a sudden No, you get, you go from, you know, there is a gradual increase of money You want your SUVs bring it back to the command center So, once you go from zero. hit 150 Minerals and you have money for that first Barracks, you just want to throw that down, especially because when you're playing three Barracks, you will require two Tech Labs And that one Barracks that finishes faster than the other can start the Tech Lab quicker and thus can also start the Stim research quicker, which is important because you want to kind of finish Stim and Combat Shield at around the same time for when you're pushing with your first 19 to 20 Marines But in this case, that's not going to happen because both Tech Labs will be built at approximately the same time, I assume, and then Combat Shield is just going to finish way before Stim ever will, and that is an issue. There's also some slight oversaturation going on in the main base Now, this could be for a very high-level mind game, but it could also not be And given the fact that this man built both of his barracks as close to the edge to make it as easy to scout as possible, I doubt it's a very high-level mind game, But because I want to flex my knowledge, I'm still going to explain this very high-level mind game that it could have been So when you're playing a three-recks opener, you play this off of a single gas That means that most every other terran build opener is with a second gas And a second gas can be built in the main. And again, Zirk can also be built on the low ground But a lot of Terrans like building it in the main these days If you have a second gas in the main base, that means that there's three extra SCVs in the main base So if a Zirklink scout would come in and would see this amount of SEVs in the natural right now, the Zerk would be able to tell us like, hey, there's probably two gas in the main currently because I'm missing three SUVs This is something that people scout for at a very high level Now, first of all, I don't think that this Zerk will scout at all. And second of all, I don't think that Clem Fromm Wish knows what he's doing. But in especially TVP, it is thus a pretty common mind game to keep three extra SUVs in your main base, mining minerals and although it's slightly less effective than mining them from the natural it does not give the Protos a free scout once they see with the adept hey there's too many SEVs here in the natural that is going to be a three rack so a very high level mind game from a player that had no clue that he was doing it just like with the monkeys and the typewriters you know if you give a group of monkeys infinite time and a bunch of typewriters then eventually they reproduce the entire works of Shakespeare. They actually, I think I mentioned this before, but they actually once did this experiment, somewhere in England, obviously They got, I think, 2K pounds for it to conduct this experiment, and they gave a couple of monkeys in a zoo, a typewriter, and they also filmed it, and they produced, well, not the entire works of Shakespeare, but they did produce five pages of writing I think it was mainly consisting of the letter E, if I, recall correctly So it wasn't the most literate monkeys You always see that Get them a typewriter and they just kind of abuse it I think midway through the experiment, one of the alpha monkeys also started using it as a lavatory, which is a fancy word for a toilet. That word always kind of trick me up Yeah, kind of trick me All right Back to this game though Enough about monkeys and typewriters As we have our own Terran monkey over here, smashing his keyboard and he actually produced a pretty decent result He has a lot of Marines out Now, like I mentioned, his stim and combat are a bit later than usual This push is supposed to hit with 19 Marines or 21 Marines, if you play with the Reactor first, one of the two, depending on how tight your macros and how many SEVs are cut, at about 455 with both Stim and Combat Shield. This push here from Clam from Wish is going to hit a full minute later with, well, slightly more Marines There's obviously five Marines back here So this is 25 Marines So he has four Marines more, but he also hits a minute late Now, that's usually not a great thing to do Let's take a look at the micro here as well Not the greatest control He kind of ate four bailing straight to the face and lost basically all of his Marines because of that But also, it really could have been a lot worse He at least tried controlling his army, and we saw something that resemble the split So I'm not even too upset by that. But yeah, what I was going to say is that if you only get five Marines more in an entire minute, that is usually not great And also with this push, it's really important that you hit as tight as possible Because later on it just becomes easier for the Zerk to hold They naturally have more units They probably have a bailing nest already done In some cases, even a Rochevarn Their queens will have more energy, which means that transfuses will be very easy. So, yeah, it's, it just feels to me that hitting harder with 21 Marines and hitting faster is more important than hitting later with four more Marines, especially given that in a minute, if you have the production that this fella had, you could technically get 12 Marines more So he was, he was lacking seven Marines somewhere They got lost in the process This is a cool wall This is a really cool well There used to be a game that I played back in the day called Settlers, where you had these dudes, I think they were called explorers and they would move the border of your kingdom manually They'd pick up like the little pixel and they drop the pixel somewhere else. And this is kind of what these dudes are doing as well, you know? They're just manually just building a new border to their kingdom And in Clamphron Wishes case, that kingdom consisted of the main and the natural, but now has a third base on the way This is a great turret as well This is defending absolutely nothing Look at that That is impressive as well If you have a base that is this field, managing to build a turret that actually covers nothing I didn't even know that was possible here This guy must be like an engineer Absolutely calculator Look at this So the only thing it's currently protecting is the SCV that just finished building it. This barracks can be attacked from the bottom This factory can be attacked everywhere The entire mineral line is free I guess if a gas SCV returns the gas over here, it would be safe against Muta Lisk But this is the most useless turret I've seen in my entire life Nice Very good job there Good start already here by Clam from Wish We also have some slight oversaturation issues in the Net Shaw I do have to admit his macro is quite good I don't like the buildings he's building or the order he's doing it in And I've mentioned this before like there's, actually this looks fine This is, is this five? No, it's six. It's one too many barracks compared to what it usually is And if this was a very high level game, I would be upset about it Oh my God, you're building one more barracks than you should be And you also have three tech labs, which are really useless But in this case, I don't mind it If you can't spend your money with five barracks and you're a lower level player, then the correct answer is to get a sixth barracks so you can spend your money easier That's a very good call And I like that he's kind of saying, you know what? I'm maybe a little bit weaker than some of the top players at this So I'll just get an extra barracks. You know, and he's not afraid to say it He's not afraid to do it Please teach up your tanks There we go Did he stim? Okay, he stimmed just now Right? That was a very late I want to see that fight again I think he just forgot the stim looking at something I'm probably busy multitasking somewhere on the map Okay So he just doesn't control anything And then, oh, he's splitting He's splitting the units and then he stims in the end Did he just? Oh, he sieged these very late as well Yeah, that was very painful Um, this is not a good fight as he lost absolutely everything He killed like five links He's down in resources lost, which is impressive. And the meta vex returned back home empty This is a very sad sight to see It's like, hey, whatever, with the boys It's like, uh, they went to a better place Can we go there as well? Yeah, sure Hop on in And boom, the next few get transported to the front Six gases coming out You still have this high barracks count Command center on the way as well Honestly, you're playing pretty close to not perfect Well, no, you're actually not playing pretty close to perfect 36 workers in your natural, which is extreme oversaturation at this point Your third base isn't even saturated yet There's no rally point on this third nexus or in this third command center either. Pureling Bain is defending right now, but he said eventually he'll transition into Hydra Corruptor Talking about a local composition, huh? These are the five Marines that are sent out, or the six Marines send out on scouting duty I don't think they're going to have a very good time on scouting duty They tried sticking together to stay warm and then they got hit by Bainlings This army is going to try to push forward I would suggest seething the tanks a little bit back maybe over here, over here, rather than straight up in the middle of the fight The tank is a long range What was this? Look at this These Marines are being surrounded. it? And this guy, rather than picking them up, uses the boost hotkey to fly away, although there's not a single anti-air unit here Look at this Same amount of clicks, the boost and the pickup The Zerk already believed that they were going to get picked up And it's like, wait a second, he left them behind and these Marines looping up Like, hey, what the hell's going on over here, boys? This is some sadistic, some sadistic metaphics. They've seen a lot of the Marines, already and now they're going to pick up the next wave he's just sending them to his death i don't think he's controlled a single army yet or tried to keep it alive um anyway i was going to talk about the the hydra into corruptor which i'm really really hyped for because the last time i saw someone play hydra corrupter is when loco sent in the iolish form and that was a great one so games with hydra corrupter have a you know a very positive connotation in my head I like this move out So once again we have a move out. I wouldn't mind if we borrow some of the mines preemptively so that we don't have to do it while we're being killed by Bainlings And well, none of these mines get a shot off The marine stim, the Matax are idling, and now they should once again boost back home Or maybe just relax over here for a bit All of these fights have actually been really, really bad It's been surprising to see how big, Terran's army is getting and how hard it is getting smashed every single time It is truly something else It does not make me happy This does not spark joy, my friends It really does not Seeing marine after marine army being sent out just straight to the dead. I do like the walling, although the wall here is so far out that it almost feels like you can't really defend it anymore It does help against potential Ling Bain run bys Then we have another big F2 move, sending our entire army across the map Three more barracks on the way, so we're already at 9 We're going up to 12 right now That is really pushing it, but once again, if you have trouble The assist lose all of his medevacs? This was the worst fight of all of him I just don't understand it Didn't he, what did he say in his form? Didn't he say was multitasking? As the game goes on, I multitask really hard. Attacking with multiple armies in different locations at the same time, while spending my money well behind it Maybe there is a theory that I have is that he was playing a second game of StarCraft at a different screen. And he was macroing in this one, and then on the second screen, he also macroed and microed and micro as well and that was where the multitasking was because so far look I like when people try to multitask but so far clam from Wish hasn't even been able to single task like he actually has been looking at his army a lot as well which is what makes me even more confused, angry and sad frustrated, lots of emotions at the same time like he scans he sees this army Now at this point Any healthy person would look at this and go I think I should go home He has five. Okay, actually kind of walks home But it's not really walking home Okay, this is not retreating by the way This is not retreating Okay, he should have retreated his entire army after the scan And just because these Marines stay alive Doesn't mean that this was a good move This search should have absolutely blasted that This does not count as these units staying alive These units wanted to die They accidentally stayed alive because the opponent got scared One of the Marines farted and they were like out of here, mate Now here comes the Corruptor Switch, which honestly also is a very surprising thing to see I'm not quite sure about it, but so far he's won every single fight in this game. So I'm not even going to get upset about this four MadovX are out and once again we have I think this is some of the multitasking Look at his legendary multitasking here The five marines get killed by these bailings Then these units get rallied once again onto creep Has there been a single scan yet Four creep tumors have been killed this entire game Oh my god, there's some legendary multitask over here Doesn't burrow any of the mines, doesn't use Stim Doesn't burrow any of the mines Will he use Tim? Will he use Tim? Will he use Tim? Will he used him? Burroughs one of the mines Does it get a shot? We get one mine shot Man, this indeed was some legendary multitask. And we get a drop in towards the main base Oh, on this little part, very cool So it's going to be able to take out three, four workers and lose both drops You know what's funny? All of these fights were legitimately god off, right? None of them got controlled 75% of the fights didn't even stim But I do believe that this was probably still better than most of the other fights As we see, the resources lost is pretty equal Like, this is how good the Terran army is, naturally Just without controlling it, you get about even trades Even if you just send random Marine marauder squads on creep, and they seem to kill nothing. The bailing is such a cost inefficient unit that if you have marauders, the banling naturally just trades poorly Now this could be a good fight, so you scan, you clear the creep, you borrow the mines, and then you try the pre-split Or in the case of clam from wish, you stim, you run as far on creep as you can, and then make sure you get hit by absolutely everything that is there Corruptors, hydras, banlings It doesn't matter Now these are two different philosophies in StarCraft We have the philosophy of trying to keep your units alive and optimizing the damage output because they stay alive longer Or you have the philosophy that Clam from Wish uses here. And it's by throwing away all your units very quickly, making your opponent believe that he's winning so that he starts building weird units like hydras and Corruptors, rather than just going into units that are powerful like the Lurker Mine's actually dealing some damage once again These Marines straight okay with the hydras, obviously I do have to admit, the upgrades have been very good The macro during this game has not been bad either There's been a lot of barracks and, well, really 16 barracks on the way, right, or four more on the way Okay, this is the first time we actually see some control If he picks up these two Marines as he realized he's losing this fight, I will be happy. He does not quite do that, but this was actually good A resource is lost is not looking great, but he killed some workers There's still only a, wait what? There's a hive and a layer Okay, so now we have the six ultras on the way This is where Clam from Wish told us that everything would start going wrong And I'm not really looking forward to that Because in my mind, everything had already been going wrong up until this point If he would stim this, I think this is a winning fight, isn't it? No? Was that a winning fight? I kind of want to see that again There's a lot of Marines It's like, what, 20, 25? It's 19 hydras There's also two. If he stims, I think he might win this It's 3-3 upgrades against 2-2 want to even These mines could burrow as well Without stim and without control, it obviously isn't going to be great He ends up killing four hydras to be exact, but that's also because a lot of his time is spent shooting corruptors I actually think it might have been possible to deal a lot of damage here Now, this is some actual multitask, and he's even controlling this army If there were drones here, this would have been a very good move Of course, there's no matter of fact with it, so the units couldn't have been taken back. I don't think there's been, Except for the five Marines and two Liberators that went back here, every unit that got sent out got killed That is a 100% death rate for your army That is really, really cool I bet you'll get loads of people to sign up for that You'll never come back Oh, that's great A couple of mines walking into the Ultras as well Matterfacts get taken out Marines, once again, not stimming, not running towards good choky positions either And at this point, once you realize your opponent, has ultras, he wants transition back into marauder. Now, I do want to explain one more thing here, Clam from Wish to you, and that is that the way that Terran works against Zirk is that you kind of have natural transitions So I'll pause it here for a second Basically, you open up with your triple CCC, something like you get three bases, you go up to five racks, you get a second factory at that point and then you can get like either double tank production from these factories or you can get mines from one factory and tanks from the other or you can get triple mine from both That's fine as well Then you get a forward base You go up to eight racks. Out of your first four barracks, first five barracks, one of them has a tech lab and the other four all have reactors that ensures that you have maximum marine production, which is really useful against the Ling Baines that Zirk tends to build in the early to midgame Once your fort base is done, you add three barracks These three barracks get a tech lab That leaves you with a four-for split of tech labs and barracks And then you start casually, you know, building a couple of marauders The reason for this is because marauders are, A, very good against banlings, tanking banlings, tanking shots in general, they're quite good at. And B, in case of like a lurker or ultra transitions, marauders are a lot tanked here and are just really good against these units because of the armor types You kind of have these natural transitions Then once you start taking a fifth base and other stuff, you can get a Ghost Academy or you can get more, you can get liberators out, and you just kind of continue tacking on and on You started with a higher marauder count and then went back completely into Marines, as you kind of wanted to keep at least some marauders in at any point in case of a transition or in case there was going to be a huge amount of banlings. I think that is the incorrect way to really look at how Terran used usually is played at the high level Like you need a good mixture of Marines and Marauders and you should be consistently producing these Then in combination with mines or with tanks, you can actually get pretty far I'm sad to see that this was an orbital as well rather than a planetary that would have maybe made a defense possible here You also, I didn't quite realize this, but you actually haven't used any energy whatsoever on any of these bases I wonder if you actually ever muled I don't know I haven't been paying attention to your bases because your fights were so mind-blowingly bad. And I'm not trying to be funny or mean here, but if you're not going to be using the energy on your orbital commands, it is better to get a planetary And it looks really dumb and it looks really bad But this just makes no sense because, yes, this has the potential to be a lot of scans, but you never scan for creep Oh, you did scan a couple of times to see where an army was, I guess But if you don't use it for mules either, it might just be better for at least base 3 and 4 to build those into planetaries. If you're a bit too slow for that, once again, it is completely fine to say, hey, I'm not quick enough for this Let me accept that and try to play around it Getting orbitals on every single base is already an absolute no-go But then if you're not even using it, it makes absolutely zero sense It really just makes no sense Now, what I do like here is that you're still trying I think that's cool Burrow the mines, burrow the mines, borrow the mines, or walk them into the ultras Both options are about equal. There's a lively debate going on currently with Terran scholars, what is better? Move commanding them into your opponent's army or burrowing them and allowing them to kill 25 links per shot They're not quite sure yet Of course, Terran's not known to be the most intelligent species You continue your production The game is pretty over at this point, but you don't know that and I don't really mind you staying in that case Hey guys, sorry to blatantly jump in here but during the edit I saw something quite intriguing The Zerkes APM according to the WCS 3. 0 overlay dropped to zero for apparently quite some time so I went and checked and as you can see in his first person perspective he actually was AFK for over two whole minutes at this point Obviously we have no clue if there was like a pause that the Terran player cancelled or whatever Could be, could not be I also don't know why he was AFK Maybe his pizza finished and he had to take it out of the oven or maybe his kid fell and needed some help or whatever But apparently Clemfrom Wish actually lost to an at least partly AFK player And I thought that was quite funny So yeah, just wanted to show you that But back to you, Kevin. You know, you said sorry for that, but it's really funny that the people that say sorry for staying in too long often are the people that don't have to say sorry And the people that are completely unaware that they're in a game that is completely unwinnable, they never say sorry and they just complain a little bit harder Like you don't see any units You walk like, what, 20 meters on creep, like two screens deep on creep and you still don't see anything So, yeah I honestly, if I were you, I would actually be getting a bit hyped Wait a second I'm accidentally winning here This guy's like panic morphing in bailings. Now sure, the moment this fella builds ultras with these larvae or these next larva pop, it's going to be hard And even if he doesn't, I mean, if it's just going to be pure Bane Hydra Ling, it's still going to be pretty difficult But honestly, it is playable You have a lot of, oh, I think you just, did you just scan a couple of times maybe? Oh yeah, you've just been scanning a lot But if you would mule, like you're actually outmining your opponent pretty hard You have a decent bank I don't think this game is over whatsoever And now you're actually multitasking as well Look at this You're stimming this army. This army, I have a feeling it might not be controlled right now I just, oh, a stim? Well, mines are a bit too far back You're completely caught on creep again But this still was a better fight than all your other fight combined Here, here Command center gets killed by a couple of hydras, this army falls Honest Wow Very close Very, very close Yeah, I think honestly if your fights weren't so, darned, you're down 9K I really didn't think that was possible in the units lost Down 9 I've never seen this in my life of a Terran playing marine bio or marine mine marauder I really didn't think this was possible Wow. Well yeah, you're absolutely dead at this point, but I'm honestly impressed and shocked It's like a weird emotion between these two You fly the command center straight into your opponent's army So I mean these altars are just going to finish the game At this point it would be wise to leave leave and now maybe this what you Okay, no, G-G Yeah, you left perfectly on time Okay Claim from which, let's look at us one more time I'm not even quite sure what you complained about You just complained about the matchup in general, right? There was nothing specific where you were like, hey, this sucked It's just, is it Inbar or do I suck? And then Zirk is too broken. Well, let's just go over some of the claims initially that you make The game goes on I multi-tick, not actually the first sentence Let's go there Well, in this game, my first push was a little late I had more units than it usually has and didn't do too badly with it Well, the reason you had more units than it usually has is because you hit a minute late It is kind of natural that if you do something a lot later, is that it's going to have slightly more of it So that's good Everything else was on point I don't think that was completely true. I believe you got a tech lab on a factory, while that factory should have been producing a reactor to swap with a starport, then you should have swapped the factory with one of the barracks with the Tech Lab All of these are details though, but saying that everything is on point when it isn't, of course, isn't exactly true either Then, as the game goes on, I multitask really hard attacking with multiple armies in different locations at the same time while spending my money well behind it Out of that entire sentence, that lasted a bit too long already, the only thing that's true is that you spent your money quite well behind it Not great, but it was fine. You had a lot of barracks you needed for it During times you were still floating 500, 600 minerals, but you didn't multitask really hard It's like maybe you were juggling with one hand on the side or you're screaming at your kids to leave Daddy alone because he's playing a video game right now and I can't pause it But you weren't multitasking in this game of StarCraft 2 You never attacked with multiple armies Sometimes you send multiple groups to a part of the map, but then you completely left them alone That's not multitasking You didn't even really single task Your upgrades also were really on point, giving me a lead in every fight. Your upgrades were indeed really on point, and that should have given you a lead in every fight had you ever controlled your units You even had more workers than him in a TVZ That is correct But you also lost 10 NK resources more units lost I have no clue how that's possible That really is extremely impressive He did two tech switches, the first one from Link Bain into Hydra Corruptor Yeah, I already kind of discussed that There really is a natural progression in the way that Terran works And it's not so much huge switches to one thing on the other. And if you're making switches in the late game, it's often between higher tech unit, not so much about the composition of your core bio army It's more about, hey, do I want more ghosts? Do I want more liberators? Do I want more tanks? Rather than saying, hey, I want 35 marauders now or 25 marries No, you always want to keep that kind of balance between these four reactors and four tech labs continuously producing units He forgets to, yeah, from that point on, it's honestly kind of over Your micro was extremely poor your multitasking was non-existent Your macro and the way you built stuff was okay. But if you're down 10K, 10K resources in units lost, then there's, like, I don't even know what to say at that point Really, all you need to do is just siege up your units and stim, and you're going to get better fights than what you're currently doing Like, I can't in good conscience say that Zirk is imbalanced if you play this sport, my friend And you, you sucked And that's the heart called truth All right That's going to be it for today Today's episode even of is it Inba or Do I Suck?

        "text": "Dear Harstam, TVP is Imba Tos shield regeneration early game means they can always pick off free marines and SUVs with their probe and stalker harass As long as they have sufficient micro, there is nothing the Taryn can do until he has stim and probably concussive shells if the Tos decides to do a blink stalker pressure You have to sit there bleeding out units until your tech hits and then pray that they messed up their macro If Terran survives the early game by some miracle, they have a few glorious moments in midgame, where their armies feel good until either disruptors or Templar with Stormcom and rain on their parade. My other matchups have 10% higher win rate than this one, and I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong Name Prometheus Race Terran Leaguemaster 4 4K MMR on the North American server All right, Prometheus, you say that stalkers and probes are too imbalanced because they regenerate shields and their early game harass is too powerful So this really is just a complaint about the early game and I can kind of empathize with that, you know? It can be kind of frustrating if there's a stalker out or a couple of stalkers and you're trying to move out as a terran player and your Marines just get kited the entire way to the Proto's base. You started with 1617 Marines, you arrive at the Protoss base, there's only nine Marines left That can be extremely frustrating I'm not quite sure how the probes are going to come into this, but I am looking forward to it, obviously Maybe I guess he's talking about the probe harass at the start, but you shouldn't really lose too much against that So what you do is you just fight the probe until you destroy the shields, then the SCV that has some damage goes back into mining and you send a new SCV on that probe The control for Terran is actually pretty easy Yeah, this is fine The Terran did a completely fine job here Nothing wrong. Oh, Protos opened up with a 12-pil and 13 gate This is an extremely fast cybernetics score that finishes about 9 to 10 seconds quicker than a standard 14 pylon into 16-gate wood And that's probably what's going to annoy the Terran player right now Now, the Terran is completely unaware of that because he didn't scout, although I'm not quite sure if I would trust the Terran, even if he scouts what's going on, to know what it means He's like, ooh, cybercores really fast Is that normal? Yeah, whatever Just go home In this case, if there was an SEV on the low ground with full HP, I do believe that you're fine on the map like 2K atmosphere because the rush distance is relatively long. He also is already queuing up a couple of Marines I'm not quite sure how that is possible How, I guess he just has a lot of of money left over Fair play So he's going to queue up a bunker after he's done with his orbital or with his command center Yeah, it's just barely not going to finish If you have a full HP SEV on the low ground, usually you're fine So this SEV can just finish the command center These Marines will be able to take out this ADAPT as long as you up the depot Well, if you don't up the depot, then ADAP gets out again and might cause some trouble downstairs. CC finishes up, but the adept already has, what, two worker kills? It's actually going to get a third worker kill as well It might still be able to shade out This is obviously not quite supposed to happen Once the adept kind of commits to going into the main base, usually what you're supposed to do is kill it So you up the depot and then you get a free adept Sure, you'll lose an SEV, but your opponent is lacking a lot of scouting, not knowing when you're going to move out You could Marines on the map Of course, because you didn't kill the SEV, none of that, or you didn't kill the ADAP, none of that is really possible. Cutting a lot of workers, by the way, for no real reason So you already lost three workers and then there also was a big worker cut You follow this up by going a third CC on the low ground while playing three racks. Now, the purpose of three racks is to go for a timing in the early game at around the five minute mark with as many marines and sometimes even a couple of marauders in there as you can gather if you have to get a third cc in before you can produce these units you'll just be cutting a lot of units out of your army that could be in that push so right now you should already be walking and you'd only have 14 marines rather than the the 19 or 20 marines that you would usually have and sure having a fast 30c is good but if you want to play a build with a quick third CC and you don't want to deal any damage, it's just better to add a third CC before the extra barracks. That way you'd probably have a similar amount of Marines, a little bit less, slightly less Marines, slightly delayed Stim and Combat Shield, but if you're not planning on hitting a timing, a tight timing with Stim and Combat Shield, it doesn't matter if they're a little bit delayed Also, putting the command center on the low ground is kind of risky because it allows your opponent to actually always attack you with stalkers and be able to kite away with blink or just by moving back That's a good scan there out of you, Prometheus I do really like that And there's really two main tools to deal with blink stalkers in this case And the first tool is a bunker. The bunker basically is extra HP for Marines The Marines can sit in the bunker and they can't be shot at, but they can shoot while they're in a bunker So it really is a one-way street if these Marines were sitting in a bunker right over here right now, they wouldn't need to stim You just maybe need to repair the bunker a little bit, but honestly, against what is it, six, seven stalkers, you probably don't have to Now, because your CC is already on the low ground and you're already mining from that CC for whatever reason, this is not possible However, you don't have to be mining from that command center yet because you only have six workers on your natural. First, saturate your natural base, defend that natural base, with a bunker, and then once you have a decent enough force that you can easily take your third base, maybe you have med effects out, maybe you have a couple of marauders with concussive shell out, in that case you can start taking your third base But right now, you're just exposing yourself in as many areas as possible for no real reason, except just to be exposed Now, if you're an exhibitionist, that's fine, but don't take that type of stuff into the StarCraft game, especially in a PVT Another Stim gets forced here And now you get a planetary fortress. Now this is almost never the correct call to get a planetary fortress on the third command center because there's almost no situation in which this is necessary Like, I guess it helps a little bit against runbyes, but you should not be getting a planetary in order to defend your third base against 10 blink stalkers You should have just been defending your natural with a single bun And then once your medevacs are out, at this point, you can easily fight back the stalkers and you can start taking good trades Like the moment your medevacs arrived, the trades have been absolutely fabulous for you And honestly, overall the trade so far have probably just been pretty decent Your opponent killed 12 of your workers, though. And that just wasn't necessary So he's now up 20 workers, or 21 workers, to be exact And you're in a world of trouble This is nothing to do with shields being broken or stalkers and probes being able to kite your army forever No, this is just because you didn't build a bunker You put five SUVs to mine in your natural, four SUVs at your third, and you just haven't produced enough workers either Despite all of this, however, despite all of this, supply is still pretty even And if you were to attack across the map right at this moment, I think you'd actually kill him He has absolutely nothing at home. he's investing in a lot of infrastructure and he's going to have a big power spike in about a minute from now but with this lack of vision it's honestly going to be really difficult for the Protos player to do anything I'd also just like to note that your opponent has about 100 APM more like this Protos player actually is quite fast and he's playing quite well some of the things aren't quite as good but he's trying to establish vision he's scouted he's controlling his army he's macroing behind it his minerals have never been that high He's continuously producing workers as well Like, honestly, this Protos, he's micro-individual stalker This is 4 4K or something like that. Like, this guy is pretty good for the level Honestly Now, you do get in here, and this will allow you to get a lot of these workers down It's a good trade for you Or should be a good trade I'm not quite sure what right-clicking the robotics beta does here rather than trying to fight off these stalkers, but I guess you know more about the future than I do just knew that that robo bay would be extremely important I'm not quite sure why Yeah, in this type of scenario, you just want to trade out your army with his army as much as possible, or you might have trouble with the counter-attacks. Like sniping the robo bay is nice, but it won't do that much for you It's not worth, you know, the killing four or five stalkers here would have been worth a lot more for you, especially because a colossi isn't going to be super necessary for the Protos player in the next two to three minutes He will still get one because he already started it, it's not necessary It's not like he's going to die He's actually in a completely fine spot He can also just build salads and more stalkers and be completely okay with that So there really is kind of an issue for you here, my friend It really is Just losing that entire army. Evening up, the resources lost, but because you've been getting outmined for the entirety of the game, it just doesn't look that brilliant for you Ford CC does go down before the Protos You're still down 20 workers exactly you're up and upgrades and that's the one thing that you have been doing well is just getting those upgrades without mules on the third base by the way or no orbital here it doesn't mean that your eco sucks a little more um and you're already behind in worker so that's obviously painful you're also not really trying to deny your opponent's vision so far you've been playing completely blind with no map vision with absolutely zero scouting no multitasking either just everything in one big ball. And it kind of shows your opponent has perfect vision all around the map, has good saturation on the basis, is now once again getting a big infrastructure boom So once again in about a minute, minute and a half from now, he's going to have a massive timing where he'll just be stronger than you are I mean, Double Forge is also chrono boosting out upgrades It's absolutely brilliant You have a big army here, but I mean, there is a colossi here and a battery I would not recommend moving in there At this point, I'd also start suggesting getting units that aren't just marines and marauders After you have like five, six metaphics, getting Vikings, throwing down a ghost academy. These are steps that you can I was going to say these are steps you can take And then you start an orbital on your fort base Now, this is absolutely the world upside down The reason So I think you're confused here, okay? The reason why you get an orbital on your third base is not the because the location of the third base usually is perfect for an orbital and other locations are better for a planetary So it's not like this is a good planetary location and no matter what base you build here should always be a planetary No, that's not how it works. The reason why you want an orbital on your third base is that as you're getting your third base as a terran, often you have map control and salad run bys and major attacks are not extremely common to come from many angles Once you get a fourth base, however, the amount of runbyes and harassment that the Proloss can do increases, as TOS tends have a little bit more map control and map version in the later stages of the midgame And also, if you get another base, you spread yourself thinner with your main army So your main army can always defend one base and it can push from that direction as well, kind of automatically clearing one lane where runbyes potentially could be coming from. However, if you have four bases and you have double orbitals, one base is almost always going to be vulnerable That is the base that you will make into a planetary, and that's the fourth base Your forward base always turns into a planetary The reason for that is because an orbital, the earlier you get it, the more use you get out of it The more energy you can use, the more scans, the more mules you can use So it is just way more useful I always recommend getting an orbital as a third base And if you're struggling defending the third base while getting an orbital orbital, maybe consider getting some tanks rather than morphing this into a planetary Just quick words of advice. And once again, I really would recommend at this point getting ghost Your opponent is spending a lot right now in research and development, you know, tacking up, getting better weapons It's as if your opponent is continuously investing into like bigger and better guns and you're still fighting with sticks And every single year at the budget meeting, you just go, guys, I think more sticks is definitely going to be the way for one more year But it just isn't At some point you need to transition out of that And just having two four to four liberators isn't quite going to cut it The EMP is probably the best tool that Terran has to deal with max Protos armies. It just halves the HP of any Protos army immediately at the cost of six to eight supply Three to four ghost is all you're going to need, especially with the enhanced shockwave upgrade that Ghosts have like there's absolutely no reason for you not to go for that now i do like that at least you're mixing in something but i'd still prefer seeing vikings against colossi rather than getting liberators liberators are very good at holding positions but vikings are good at attacking into a position and kiting back while kind of having the vikings zone out the colossi um this is a good setup though and i do like this you you start moving in okay um Move these two Liberators slightly forward. Former concave with your army At least the marauders are being sent for it It's not the worst micro so far Sure, only half of your army is attacking and none of the Liberators are currently shooting Oh my God That was a sick sniper on the disruptor Wow You actually I'm not quite sure if this was really good micro or you got lucky that you shot that one disruptor and that there was no third colossi here but this fight should have been god-awful because you never made a concave in your life None of your liberators were fighting, but you still honestly did an okay job I'm surprised. Okay, well, all the Marines being in front, getting the colossi swipes is not quite what you want There goes all the praise Straight out of window It was a good attempt, though It was a good attempt Almost killed him And now that you've seen that he has a nice-looking arm you're like, okay, what do we remax on? Two more marauders, six more Marines, getting the three-three upgrades That is useful Still no Ghost Academy, though That is getting a little bit painful It's funny to me as well that you complain about shields, yet you don't get a Ghost Academy It's like you literally have a unit that destroys shields It's like practically instant It has a radius that is the size of the screen. It is often harder to miss and an EMP then to hit it You just accidentally click and all the shields are gone of your opponent's arm You're like, oh, didn't even know I did something That's an EMP for you You just continue with the Liberators though Not a huge fan of that Sadat run by in towards the main base You see that and you decide to counterattack Okay Look at this This is some cute glaive adapter This prolos honestly is really good If his fight, his main fight wasn't so it wouldn't have been so bad This guy would be really, really sick He has good macro, good control of his units He plays proper StarCraft too, also getting the Shadow Stride. This guy's been watching some Pro StarCraft He's also pretty fast Look at that 253 for a 4 4K toss That's actually crazy This guy is proper It really is You move command some of your air army into the Protos army You end up losing, what is it? two Metafax, a Liberator here before the fight truly starts Oh, my This TOS control is actually good The way he moves with the disruptors and with the Colossi I really do like it Poof Big disruptor shot hits as well Yeah You try to do the same thing I kind of want to see that again. You try to do the same thing here as in the previous fight, but this only works against very low numbers of Disruptors. Or if all the Disruptors are riding your face. I really do like it when Terran tries and it fills. I don't think anything gives me more joy in life. Literally nothing sparks more joy than that. Look at this. So you see the Disruptor shot. It's like, oh, it's pretty far in the back. Right now it's like a split second decision, you know, it's like, can I catch this, or can I not catch it? You shoot down this Disruptor first, you do another A move and you take out a Stalker, and then, oh, it's too late already. Disruptor goes off. You lose your entire army not entirely the way you should be fighting against this Not entirely But good attempt nonetheless, you know I appreciate what you're trying to do here I really do You're actually trying to clam plays like this as well Clam is really good at this Okay, clam at sniping disruptors He's the king He sees a disruptor and he snipes it You sniping disruptors is slightly different. You know, if clam of disruptor, sniping is kind of what Canon in D is you know the perfect beautiful song played well then you would be well canon in D but this version it It might It It It It It It might sound very similar to the It might sound very similar to the original, but if you listen closely, it's just slightly different And it's the same with your control against disruptors People might mistake you for clan, but if they look closer, they just see as not quite the case Oh! Another Disruptor shot? Let's see you're going to try again We actually have a separate Holtki for Liberators as well There's more than the average 7K MMR Terran player. Okay, now you can actually jump on this, by the way Now you actually can, yeah All of the shots have been fired Still, an EMP here would be absolutely priceless I'm not quite sure how you're doing it, but the traits are even You've been down the entire game in Eco, but yet your army supply is relatively close, and you're still somewhat winning fights You're not actually winning the fight, but you're really close to winning the fights, which is, well, I mean, it's impressive I honestly, I'm impressed. If you want to play this style, by the way, that you're playing, like, I've been saying for a long time now that you need ghosts and Vikings are great, but if all you want to do is just build Marine Marauder, at least you need to split your army Because Marine Marauder in small balls against Gateway units are actually quite good However, if you're fighting a massive ball of Colossi Disruptor, Immortal Storm, whatever, Yeah, they're going to suck But if you split up this army in two groups, groups, one to the left, one to the right side, first of all, you can show of your fancy multitasking And second of all, with your micro, it doesn't really matter whether you aim move or not. Or if you're paying attention to the army, it doesn't change much in the outcome of the fights, at least not with how you've been microing so far Perhaps you won't lose as much to disruptors anymore because you don't try to snip them if you're not paying attention Interesting liberated position Once again, Marines tanking all of the Colossi shots Another quick trick is to put the marauders in front of the army so that they actually tank, or put the marauders in front of the army so that they tank the shots of the Colossi and then your Marines can deal damage behind that That is the ultimate play. Another cool trick is to form concaves just to maximize your damage output, make it difficult for your opponent to splash on top of you as well This is a good call, the base trade You can't fight into this army and thus the only correct call is to just base trade Now once again, if you would split your army in two parts here, one towards the right side, one towards the left side, that would actually really help in this endeavor of trying to win a base trade Sadly, that's not what you're doing Is this just going to recall? I guess he will after he kills this base, right? I'd recall to this one He'll recall to the natural. If he recalls to the left side base, he's an idiot Okay I don't mind it I actually really like this This is the correct base to recall too, I think Okay Last time you got stuck in a corner, you decided to attack the Robo Bay It's a bait Robo way once again The Protos saw what you did that first time It's like, ooh, if I could bait him one more time into that, that would be sick Okay, you just continue fine The moment you get trapped, rather than trying to trade out your army, you just really focus on killing all the buildings Look at that Once again, look at this This is actually sick It's like your panic response. You actually didn't have that bad of a position in his base here If you just form a concave on top of the ramp, or even while you're down here, look at this If you just split your army, make somewhat of a concave, there's not that much splash Everything is kind of slowly but surely coming in one by one Zellets are stuck behind stalkers There's only two disruptor shots left as this disruptor already shot, literally all you need to do right now is not walk into two massive disruptor shots, and that's kind of what you do, because you're busy targeting down a robotics facility rather than fighting against your opponent's army Oh, look! Multitask. I think this was your rally, and you forgot to rally it back, isn't it? I don't think this is intentional, because it's not being controlled It is good multitasking, though, the accidental multitask, but still good multitask I wish I could accidentally multitask every now and again I just move command my zealots into hatcheries Doesn't quite seem to do the trick anymore Ah, now you're actually controlling this And you didn't stim this army, so it wasn't an F2 I'm very proud of you Is it Prometheus probably is one of the only terrans that doesn't actually have F2 bound to a hotkey He doesn't really seem to use it at all And I like it I don't mind it too much. These two adepts have been Well, this this cliff has been a bit abused a lot so far this game I think this is like one of the tricks that Tipu knows and then he just keeps using it again and again Like the guy that I knew back in high school, they would just show me the same magic trick again and again because he only had one of them After doing the same car trick 25 times in a row, it isn't quite as impressive anymore, but still interesting nonetheless Car tricks, very cool Yeah, Proz is just really far ahead at this point I mean, he has 3 6K resources or 3 6K minerals, 1,300 gas as well. And you lose your base, walk into another disruptor shot And just, you know, the business as usual, I guess we'd say You have zero mining right now You're aware that your opponent has at least one and a half mining base remaining Now, this means that there's a lot of pressure on you to perform right in this moment You need to go do something And that's, exactly what you're going to be doing You're just going to start marching across the map And although this looks like the incorrect call, this actually is the correct call You also snip both disruptors And then here, you tap out and you leave the game Yeah, this was a very sad affair. I understand that you were upset by the early game, these stalkers, destroying way too many Marines But this problem could have been easily solved by getting a bunker or opening up with a view build order, like an actual 3-Rex, an actual triple CCC opener, or you could open, if you really struggle with this, and this is a problem that you often have, you could just open up with tanks or like with a cyclone first, that way you can push them back and afterwards you can get tanks You can open up with a mine drop and a bunker at home with a mind drop and you just idle it in the dead space. That way, whenever the Protolus is at your doorstep, you send in a mine drop And if he never goes to your doorstep, you leave the mind drop in the dead space It's a win-win It's a really cool move isn't great against Stargate Openers, but if he isn't doing a Stargate opener, that's a cool trick that you can use to force the Protos to stay home However, if you don't do any of these tricks, you can still just build a freaking bunker and you're going to be fine You don't have to float your third CC and you shouldn't float your third CC to a third base location if you can't defend that third base location without taking massive losses. That is just kind of obvious And you can say, well, TOSS will get a way faster third TOS right now had a third base that was mining for way more as well because you lost freaking 12 SUVs Like no matter what happens, it's just going to be better for you to just safely SUV up or probe up SIVY up would be the correct word for Taryn, I guess Savely SUV up And then from there on I'll start expanding once you can safely take it This made absolutely no sense Your macro honestly was quite good It was on point your control at times was okay, although I do believe that was more luck than competence necessarily. So maybe you just got lucky with a couple of good stim-ins You didn't really seem to have a very good clue about judging fights when disruptors would be hitting you, when Colossi would be killing all of your Marines You had some opportunities to win the game Yeah, that really leaves me just with one thing And that is that although this was a frustrating game for you, you made so many mistakes Your army composition also was quite terrible Your early game was god-awful Your eco sucked the entire game This had nothing to do with Protos or with shields being overpowered This had to do with you sucking, my friend And that's the harsh reality of things It is what it is All right. It's going to be it for me today Thanks all so much for watching If you didn't enjoy this episode of Is It Embar or Do I Suck, and you think, hey, I think I have a replay where my opponent's race was truly in balance Be sure to send it using the Google Doc down below in the description I'm especially looking for replays on the new patch I'll still be maybe looking at some older ones, but if you guys have some new replays, be sure to send them over And perhaps next week, I'll be seeing if what you played again is truly imbalanced, or if you suck Thank you for watching Smash like and bye."

This is a replay from the Korean server against Korean Protos Progamer Prince Prince is currently a 6 4K MMR player on Korea, and Demi is 5 6K 6K So a solid, well, what is it? 800-ish MMR below his opponent But yet complaining about void rays Well, not void race, but carriers, actually The void ray nerve did its job and void race, you know, are not as good anymore But the carriers are the real problem because the lack of queen walks means that you can just rush straight into carriers Now, I want to talk a little bit about this obviously I think it's an interesting thought And the first thing I want to talk about is the corrupter. The corrupter is the counter to the carrier And corruptor timings were always the counter to very quick carriers Whenever a protos survived the early game, whether that was with some disruptors, and then straight up switched into carriers without void rays, they would often struggle with corruptor timings because they don't have any void race to defend the carriers rushing out carriers by themselves does absolutely nothing because you tend to just die You still need the void race when you're rushing out carriers and because the void rate time got nerfed and the amount that you need to pay to build void race went up, that should be more difficult So the initial premise that carrier rushing is now more viable, in my opinion, is incorrect. Now, my opinion has been wrong in the past and it could be wrong again, but I don't think it is wrong in this case We're just going to have a look to see where it went wrong for Demi if there is anything he could have done better or if Prince maybe has found the Holy Grill Does he know how to rush into carriers without building any void race whatsoever or does he have some other special tricks that make it impossible to kill him? I'm actually kind of curious because Demi said that he hit a decentish timing as well and he had a good early game. And often these are the two requirements, you know, hitting a decent timing after having a good early game, to kill a carrier rushing player So if Prince manages to survive, I'm very curious to see what he has Because personally, I almost never survive when I rush into carriers before the patch and after the patch Well, especially after the patch It's practically impossible We saw Prince open up with a block here on the natural Very common at the high level Is he walking in a heart? Nah, not quite a heart You're missing the little indent here of the heart but it's pretty close Demi going for the inject, double inject, I like it Hatchery goes down at a standard timing as well. I mean, these guys are pro players It's going to be really weird if I can see something that is wrong in the build order It's of course important to see what both players are doing, but they know what to do They have the speed to do what they have to do as well Actually, pretty low APM for a Zirk player, but it's okay Voidray first here for Prince So this is not a straight-up rush into carriers I honestly kind of suspected or expected like a four-gas built, double Stargate, quick carrier rush, that type of play that we've seen in the past But this actually still opens up with a void ray here So most likely it's going to be void ray into Oracle. A pylon in the wall indicates that he wants to get a very fast third base and skip the second gateway for a little bit I do like this type of play Especially now that the void ray is a bit more expensive, this makes the initial build order very similar to what it was pre-patch You just have one less gateway and your wall is a little bit wonky as well Demi sees that there's a Voidre out and immediately pulls back all of his overlords Great play and is of course the correct play as well You don't want any of these overlords getting caught This one overlord is still trying to look for any oracles. I guess Demi believes that he can pull it back in time if the void ray ends up showing up there I guess the spores, are they a little early? That's actually fine, two spores Once again, I can kind of live with this Sometimes people stay on a single spore for a long time that boost the Zirk eco a little bit because one drone mines for a bit longer It is a very fast fleet beacon indeed out of the Protos and a second Stargate Now, first of all, there's also some initial problems with this this of course And the first problem that you can kind of see with that is that this would be pretty difficult to defend any type of Nidus attack. Now these attacks would be perhaps some type of blind counter like an attack Like there's without a forge, without a robo, without disruptors, it's going to be impossible to hold your third pace if there's a Queen Ling Nidus, like how dark has been playing recently I think he did it against Classic in the GSL If Demi would do something like this, this build would die So this is not, first of all, a safe builder There are loads of build orders that are very good if you get away with it, but it's not necessarily safe Sure, the Queen Walk is not viable anymore against this, but there are other builds that can just straight up kill this. And sometimes that is just kind of part of the game. You know, you can play greedy and then die against blind counters. That is just how it works. But there's also other things that usually can happen against carrier rushes, and we'll see what Demi decides to do. So far as early game is quite good, except for his scouting. Okay, five minutes and ten seconds into the game, and he wasn't even aware whether there was a third base or not. That is just a little bit odd. If all you've seen is a single Void Ray on an Oracle, literally anything can be a follow-up. There could be Glaives coming. It could be double Stargate. it could be a charge lot all in like we've seen Zest do a lot on maps like Blackburn but also on maps like oxide before there's just a lot of builds that can come from it and it's important to at least confirm that the third base is there and up until 509 so he literally had what is it 71 seconds to scout this base and he didn't do it by the time he arrived his battery is almost on the base has already finished the worker as well the gases yeah the gases are already starting like this is an extremely late scout now it's not going to hurt him because the correct response against the third base is building drones and queens. And so far what Demi has been doing is building drones and queens, which is absolutely correct So although he's made a mistake of not scouting, it has had no consequences whatsoever Prince has made no major errors He is consistently scouting I don't really see any minor mistakes either I guess he took a little bit too much damage on this Oracle, which kind of sucks He lets the creep spread get a bit far there's no attempt of denial whatsoever Another point where I'd like to say something is that usually at high level, Zirks have links spread across the map for two reasons. One, to spot any type of move out, whether that's with Glave adapts, or to see wherever the Oracle or the void race, or in this case, the carriers are going to be hitting if they do end up going across the map, also for prisms So you'd have like a link patrolling here, a link patrolling here, maybe a link patrolling this area You just kind of create like a ring of vision around the Protl's base And because links are so cheap, it is kind of easy to do It's kind of easy to set up And because this Protols is skipping basically every single unit, he would not have the units to get any type of map control This is good movement. Demi's early game has actually been fantastic I just like to stress that here Is that he has, did he miss that? Oh, that is super unfortunate Did he actually miss that? That was so close No? Oh, no Oh, oh, oh He saw it Well, he saw it, but he didn't really see it However, he's still going to go in towards the main base, seize the fleet beacon, seized extra void race But because he knows that there's no extra void race except this one, with some deductive reasoning, he should be able to figure out that the carriers are coming towards his base And if carriers are coming, there's a pretty easy response. What you need to do is you pull all queens to the same position You move this spore to the front You move this spore to the front over here And you probably build a spore at your fort base as well The queens from your main base also need to leave the main base and move forward Because if you have all queens together and there's a single spore helping you defend, two carriers are going to do absolutely nothing, especially if those carriers don't even have any upgrades yet Now, I like that he's still going for the Ling movement, but right now there are bigger fish to fry. And the bigger fish to fry really these two carriers, right? So right now he spots the carriers, immediately moves the sport Fantastic quick response here Queens from the main need to come over as well There is a spire on the way already and it's about to finish up So he can just produce a bunch of corruptors if he wants to Often though, if you want to play Ooh, this is actually kind cool If these queens were here earlier, I don't think that queen would have necessarily died That sucks Yeah He's going to go corruptors Often if they play corruptor timings, you first want to get the roaches before you get the corruptor So that's why he was a little bit hesitant there. He was like, hey, can I hold this without having to build corruptors? I think that that was his thought process why he, you know, he hesitated for a second Now we could say that he's slow, but I actually think there was a, there was a decision being made there And I don't want to criticize anyone for thinking I think that generally is a good quality if you're considering something and seeing how a fight goes before making a big decision I think that's a very good call. I honestly believe that Demi has been playing a fantastic game and although he's had some minor errors with the late scout, which was eventually inconsequential and losing the two queens for free, he has good creep spread, he has fantastic Eco, plus one is about to finish up, He has ravagers on the way I think his position is really good And this is exactly what I was talking about, by the way Carrier rushes are only good if you build void rays with them And what are we seeing out of Prince here? He's building void rays So this carrier rush achieved nothing except kill two queens These void rays, however, if you compare prepatch to post patch, are way more expensive or quite. quite a bit more expensive The void race take longer to pop out as well, so there's going to be less void race for the defense This situation, prepatch, would have been way better for the Protos player Way, way better If the Protos would have taken a fort base at 545 prepatch, probably would have had two extra void race at this point already and would have been capable of affording more cannons over here as well So so far, the claim that anything is worst post-patch for Zerk, when it's coming the rushing out carrier, I think is pretty much false Let's have a look at this push, though I love these overlords This is so cool. He's saying, hey, my queens, so for the people who don't know, by the way, queens can't transfuse off creep anymore That is the major nerve to Zirk And it makes them very difficult to control It's actually true I know people like to joke about it, but it makes these types of pushes a lot harder You need to poop overlord It's a hassle Then whenever they move off creep, they still can't do anything You need to start spreading creep It's just extremely annoying, especially because one of the main moves with these types of pushes is that you need to send the queens in first to tank for the damage And if you always have to wait for creep, that is not very viable. Sending in the revergers first usually isn't quite what you want So these reverters are going in and Prince is moving over to defend I honestly kind of like this position here for Demi. So you just You force out the prismatic alignment You move back You constantly use the reverger bile Okay he takes out the fort base Continues producing corruptors He was a little late with that He built seven at the same time Rather than continuously adding on Right now what you want to be doing is you add an infestation pit Probably start plus two range here as well And you're honestly in a very good spot You can also continue moving forward by the way I'm not saying he should go back But there's plenty of money to do everything at once Plus one is starting right now for air Prismatic alignment has already been used This is a mistake here This is actually a mistake. So the queens are the main tanking unit of this force And it's really important that they're at the front because they tank not only the void ray damage and the carrier damage, but they also tank a disruptor shot If you see a bunch of queens moving forward, you just want to fire a disruptor at them because as long as these queens are attacking first, your void rays and carriers can't be fighting that well against them because their damage, like the damage of the void ray isn't great against the queens So ideally you want to have the void rays either attacking corruptors or if revergers are isolated, you take those out. The ravagers are not zoning any of these void rays at this point with piles, which is something you want to consistently be doing If we just take a quick look at this fight again, even if the queens are not here, The way that we'd want to be fighting this is we throw a bile wherever the air army is every three seconds This forces the protels to either split his void race and lose a little bit of damage output or to just fly back and lose a lot of damage output and further the position of the Zerk, making it harder for the protols to reinforce from the natural This type of stuff is kind of important Corruptors continue moving in. gets one of the carriers Like I said, I think he tanks a massive disruptor shot here, which isn't exactly brilliant Poof, that's four ravagers It's not the greatest split Actually, it was not a split whatsoever There's still a lot of money in the bank, though, so he can just kind of reinforce this position with more corruptors I just wish he had an infestation pit started already I am not entirely sure why Demi left here? If I just look at this position right now Four base, eight gas There's a lot of minerals There's a lot of gas in the bank There's still 22 corruptors. There's actually so many corruptors that I believe that when the prismatic alignment ends, that the corruptors will win the air fight There's only six interceptors and plus one 22 corruptors against seven void rays without prismatic alignment and two carriers with six interceptors total, especially if there's a couple queens still around that can tank and transfuse If you split them and don't get splashed by the arcons, I think you actually just win the game Add on top of that that you have a crap ton of money in the bank You could be taking a fifth base You can get like 10 more corruptors with this as well your opponent is mining out from the main base He's soon to start mining out the natural. He hasn't even started a fort base yet And he's only on double Stargate air production And his ground is, well, has a single upgrade, but he only has seven gateways I think this game is over, but it's not over for the person you believe it to be over for Like, you've won you actually won the game at this point You're 800 MMR below someone He does a build order that is extremely greedy and dies to a lot of things in the early game You do a timing push You kill him and then you complain What outcome would you want? Like what is it with Zirk players? Do they just want everything handed to them? Maybe like after six minutes. of surviving against Protos that we start building a wonder in the back of your base and if the wonder stays up for five more minutes that you just get the MMR of your opponent, I just don't understand what more you want This is a completely one scenario Yes, you played well in the early game, you made some minor mistakes Then you did a timing which is supposed to kill your opponent and you killed your opponent I just don't even understand really what you're complaining about You won the game You just left it What was it? You said he rushed carriers and he played so greedy he was able to take a fast forward base. Yes, he was capable of doing that and you also took a very fast forward base and had way better eco than him Like if the toss plays greedy, Zer can just play greedier and then do a timing and kill the Protos If Protos is able to rush carriers like this, I might just not play anymore I mean, Protos is able to rush carriers like this and you're able to kill them You've shown that you're capable of killing Protos when they rush carriers like this I don't even understand what you're complaining about This is like saying, well, if Terrans can open up 5C before Barracks, I don't even want to play this game anymore. So like, Terran can open 5C before Barracks and nothing is stopping you from sending 12 links across the map and winning the game It's the same with this protos This protos rushed carriers took a fort base six minutes in and you won the game Like, what is the problem? Except that you have absolutely no clue what's going on here Like, I don't even understand it You go on a date It goes fantastic I have a brilliant time And the person you go on the date with at the end is, hey, you'll call me tomorrow, right? Then you go home, block her on Facebook, the leader from your phone and never talk with her again It's like, it doesn't make any sense. It's basically what you just did, but then in Starcraft, I'm just stunned Like, I know that most people, they kind of rage send a replay, but this is so obviously, like, what is it that you saw here that even made you want to leave? Like, I genuinely don't understand Oh, he only had one carrier even It wasn't even two He had one carrier I thought there was two carriers, but he literally just has a single carrier Like, this is the thing that you see before you leave How many corruptors is this? This is like about 12 Then we add 8, 9 12 plus 9 21 I think you have 21 corruptors here And there's one more flying over Yeah. So these are all 22 corruptors are here And you literally see six void rays and one carrier You even have creepier so you can't transfuse I honestly just don't understand this I don't even think you suck either, but I also don't think it's imbalanced I just don't know what to do with this You won the game You played well You played a good game You macroed well Your control wasn't brilliant, but you played well And you won It's a draw You didn't suck And it is not imbalanced All right I draw The first one Well, congratulations Demi, I guess I hope everyone else enjoyed this And probably is just as confused as I am And if you are, that's okay. And we can get through it together And the best way to get through it together is to hit the like button on this video, shared with your friends that used to play StarCraft in 2010, but now play Fortnite with their three-year-old son, tell them, hey, this is way more fun Come back to us All right Thank you for watching, and I hope to see all of you next time for a new video Bye-bye."

        "text": "Hello, Harsdom I played a great game of Terran versus Protols and still lost I absolutely destroyed this guy in the early game and thought I was about to win many times I never overextended and heavily outplayed my opponent in every way My opponent made multiple game losing mistakes That's simply not possible If you make one game losing mistake, you lose the game That's kind of in the word there If you make multiple game losing mistakes and you end up winning the game, none of these mistakes were game losing It's literally the definition of the word If this is how you start your imbalance complaint form, I am kind of skeptical from the start body. Anyway, throwing away Colossi in the early game and having his fort denied repeatedly, taking bad fights over and over, and I defended against the late game DT harass extremely well However, my opponent was playing the easier race and had infinite money as soon as I couldn't close it out in the early game My opponent even admits this After constantly being ahead the entire game, the game immediately ended when I took one bad fight with some bad disruptor shots Protos can make infinitely many mistakes and the Terran can just make one mistake and lose So the question that is here is, is it Imba? Or do I suck? Name I love oof with an F, race, Terran league Grandmaster The OMR 5. 3. And the server is North American. A North American Terran complainer checking all the boxes here, beautiful stuff. Maru spinning around the Nexus as well. This is going to be a classic I can absolutely feel it. As our good friend, I Love Uf, starts here on Burlingrad. Now, this is exciting because I Love Uf is obviously someone that knows about professional Terran players. He watches Maru VODs. He copies the build orders of Maru, he micros his Reaper with 700 apm while floating 800 minerals at home, forgetting about the buildings. I am really looking forward to this game. On the other hand, we have this Omega Chet Protoss player just sitting here on his barcode. He probably doesn't even know about professional Starcraft. He doesn't know the word e-sports He has no clue what that all is about He just thinks it's weird capitalization Like this guy, you know, he just plays two, three games in his free time, accidentally made it to this MMR and then at some point, you know, might apologize for playing the race and that's completely fine This guy, you know, he's other things going on in his life So he's going to scout with his probe I kind of just want to follow the protos for a little bit as well You know, starts harassing, you know, just being annoying, but not too annoying He doesn't want to discourage his opponents too much Barrecks opener here, barracks into gas out of I Love Oof. And we'll follow it up with a one- one Rex expand, which is really just the golden standard of the Terran versus Protos matchup Honestly, the golden standard of TVP and TVZ It's this Oh, it's a nice scout here Look at that It's kind of early as well It's going to delay your CC by just a tiny tad Also, probably has some poor SUV control, though It feels like it's being delayed by a bit too much There's no double stacking going on on this mineral patch So let me explain this for the people that are not aware In every base you have four close-by mineral patches, which you want to be mining from as early as possible in the game. And you can double-stack the workers on top of it, so you just gain a little bit extra money, while the far-away mineral patches, you want to saturate, well, not as late as possible, but just later, these have the priority for sure So you always want to double-stack If you don't do that, you're just going to get slightly less minerals in the early game And I think that is what happened here for I-Love Oof, because, well, this mineral patch still isn't double mining That's kind of bad I saw a worker bouncing around earlier as well Look at this guy being sent back to the wrong So now you have three workers on a faraway mineral patch and only one on a close by one. That is definitely not the way that you wanted Second gas gets thrown down though So does the bunker fast Twilight here out of the Protos and a second unit also being cronaut This toss is playing pretty safe but also has the ability to get really fast blink And this is kind of cool to see I like this type of opener a decent amount, honestly It should start to blink the moment that it finishes I'm not quite sure why he can't He must have also messed something up in the early game a little bit P-P Oh, look at that Of course, the Protos player just allows the pause of his opponent Doesn't give a crap about it This adapt is just. You're allowed to respond with the Marines I think I Love Oof must have played against the guy that was cheating with his ADAPT And the ADAPT managed to one shot Marines If you have five Marines against one ADAPT, you're going to absolutely destroy that ADAPT Hell, if you have three Marines against one ADAPT, you're going to win Which is why the Marine into Reactor Build is so popular, because it gets out three Marines as the first ADAPT hits you I'm not quite sure why you were sitting in the bunker, but it costs you a little bit of mining time for no reason whatsoever It kind of was a slow response. You're also not getting a helion, which means that the fast SCV scout is nice, but it doesn't give you any info on what tech your opponent is playing, and now you don't know what it is In this case, it's not that bad because the double mind drop is actually quite good against what you're facing Against blink, this is actually really good However, if you were playing against someone to play Stargate first and saves up Phoenixes in their main base, you would just straight up lose this Madovac with the two minds, and that, my friend, would not be good I'm not quite sure what this Protos is doing, but he moved out of position and then allowed you to move into the natural. And you said, no, good sir, you were out of position and I will not take the victory This makes absolutely no sense This is like you're in one-to-one combat with someone You're in like the full night gear, you know, with the helmet But your opponent takes off the helmet and hands you a hammer to hit him on the head head You throw the hammer away, put his helmet back on his hat, and then start pretending like you want to deal damage again This makes absolutely zero sense You could have denied mining in two mineral lines You could have dropped one mine here and one mine here This would have cost maybe 250, 300 minerals. Right now it costs him, well, absolutely nothing so far This meta fact now needs to idle here until your main push arrives It will force some of the Protos units to be positioned over here and some protos units to be positioned over here So you're still going to be occupying maybe 10, 10 protos supply, 6 supply over here, 4 supply over here Put 4 and 6 together and you get 10 This is an incorrect move It works out because he had no units here But, okay, yeah, rebarrow makes absolutely no sense Yeah, this is a very, very poor move this is the type of move that works in maybe mid-diamond, where the other guy might just not be paying attention. But in Grandmaster, if there's only one thing happening at the same time, I mean, like, he knows how to split workers, right? Like, you know he has, blink, you know you're going to lose that MET effect Now you end up killing two workers You lost the MET effect, you lost two minds But more importantly, he doesn't need to keep any units here He doesn't need to keep any units here so you just weakened your own push for no reason whatsoever I love this drop though I think this is a very cool play People like Utermal, Beyond are huge fans of this type of drop play, where they send their first two MEDAX around and move out with their kind of their main area. You can see that this movement was stolen from a top terran And I'm not saying that in a bad way Stealing in StarCraft is good Like if someone else does something well, you just copy it and just like that, you're as good as them Well, if you're somewhat close with the execution as well, of course So I'm personally a huge fan of that Talking about stealing things, I haven't mentioned it yet, but Ailof Uf was a Korean Terran player in Brutwar, his name was written with a fee, whose nickname was Cheater Teren And the reason his nickname was Cheater Taryn was because he had such good macro, and people, well, you know, it was a joke He knew he wasn't like resource hacking. But his macro was so good that they couldn't believe, that he always had so many units and so much money He wasn't floating the money, but, you know, he was rich Good macro is what I'm trying to say We'll see if you are the same, or if your nickname would be slightly different We'll have to keep an eye on that I like this push-out very much, though, and I like this drop in the main as well I'm sad that Combat Shield isn't done yet Seven minutes and 20 seconds into the game, and I'm confused by that But this drop is dealing damage anyway, so it shouldn't really matter You're dealing a fair amount of damage. Focusing all the pilots overkilling workers might actually be a mistake At the same time you have this fight, which is going somewhat okay, I guess The Colossi stay alive though, which is frustrating And he still has blink Overall, not a bad fight The Protos has a lot of money in the bank, but so do you Ah, look at this, this is a trick This is what I do with Terran as well This is called the fake macro This is when you see that you're floating a fair amount of units And to make yourself feel better about yourself, you just queue up some marauders, you know, some extra units You just queue them up even though you're already building them. This doesn't do anything for you, but at least the money is lower This is like when it's like 3 a m and you decide that rather than going to bed, you'll browse Twitter for five more hours and then as you're in bed you get the great idea that tomorrow is the first day that ever that you're going to run or that you'll go to the gym or you'll start eating healthy it's kind of the same here this is the fake life improvement building these two marauders don't fall for it guys you never get good ideas at 3 a m Trust me I tried. These two matter of facts are going to return home the reason why I don't mind the proto's floating as much is because he's forced to float you just took out all of his productions So although it is bad that he has this much money, it is more understandable than you having the money Also, Terran macro is generally easier because you don't have to look at your production in order to build anything This is a fact and honestly not debatable Terrans try it, but there's actually no argument for Terran macro being harder than Protos macro I said what I said, and I will not take it back So this guy takes a fort base. Okay, so here I guess we're going to see some of the, the fourth port cancels that we were talking about, right? Yeah, you're ahead in supply And I'd like to buy, basically, I would like to point something out here as well So currently, I Love Oof, if we just look at the state of the game, I Love Oof is in an okay position, but he's not in a very special position His supply is good, but Taryn is almost always up in supply Being happy that you're up in supply in a TVP is like being happy that your three-month-old baby is burping Like every three-month-old baby burbs, and none of your Facebook friends care about it, so stop posting on my timeline. And it's the same in TVP here Like, you're always going to be up in supply because you just have more money because of the mule, usually And also, Protos requires more production in the early game You require eight gates in order to produce properly Terran only requires five barracks, and often they stay on three racks for a very long time, allowing them to get high supply, blah, blah, blah So if we actually analyze the state of the game, work account is pretty even, usually good for Terran, upgrade, slightly up for Terran, that's no big deal The fact that there are two colossi out is really good for Prodos. The fact that he has a craptone of gateways, eight out already, two more on the way, is also really, really good for Prodos The only thing Toss really is lacking at this point is vision on the map His fort base being canceled is annoying, but Terran also isn't thinking about a fort base yet so it's not the end of the world Tos can be completely fine playing three base against three base It's not like Protos is the Zerk of the TVP matchup where you always need to be 20 workers ahead and you always need to be upper base No, if you have good tech and you have okay upgrades, you can delay your fort base by a little bit That is completely okay. I don't really like tank drops with small bio-armies usually This was, I think, a bad drop and didn't deal a lot of damage You cancel the fort base, but yeah, it is what it is Ooh, look at that That's a cool Colossi walk Straight down the ramp into a Marauder Force He's going to lose one, two Colossi for, it's not entirely free, but it feels pretty free at least Overall units lost, by the way, slightly in favor of Tarran That is good, usually for the Tarrant Once again, Fort Base is being taken I assume this one's going to get cancelled again because I don't really see a way for the toss to hold this for now. Right now, if Taryn would push the advantage, I think he'd have a decent chance at straight up winning the game With tanks, two tanks, four Vikings, there's no real ground army to speak off for ProDos So a push that hits together right now that is microd semi-decently should be capable of dealing a lot of damage We are lacking continued Viking production though, which is one of the most vital thing We have no unit production whatsoever, or we had no unit production whatsoever, only two Vikings Look at this A lot of buildings being produced, but nothing else really, and that's kind of surprising This also means that he can't attack in the next minute or so. And this is often a difference I see between the top Terrans and some of the lower tier Terrans is that a lot of the top terrans, they basically, they're maxing out on army for a very long time So they want to get the maximum amount of units out of their barracks, out of their starport, out of their factory And then as they move out, they get a fort base, they throw down their armory, they throw down their eBay, maybe their extra barracks as well But you're already investing in all of these things, or you're invested in these things 60 seconds ago, which means that your peak unit production was 60 seconds ago And that means that you should have hit 60 seconds ago. This makes absolutely no sense You're optimizing for a timing That timing is now gone And marching across the map at this point is objectively bad It makes very little sense And if the Protos had any map vision whatsoever, you probably would die as you're walking Because TOS just has a way, way bigger army Right now, if you plan on playing this economically, with also 83 workers, by the way, you just need to sit back a little bit and I would not really recommend taking this type of fight Even if this fight might go well for you because the Protos has three Arcons in the back for no reason No, he actually crushes your army I'm happy that this happens. Sometimes I'm very sure that I'm correct, but then the outcome isn't what I wanted it to be But this time the outcome is exactly what I wanted to be You lose your entire army, you're up in Eco, but this was an extremely bad fight for you, and this was an extremely bad timing for you to take the fight I really would like you to pay attention to some of the top towns Clambion, Hero Marine These guys, they will always optimize for a timing if they want to hit it, and if not, they're getting their Ford base faster They're getting their extra armory and eBay a lot quicker, if you want to go straight into late game. And it looks to me like you're going straight into late game, and in that case, you want to probably keep an two-armie split on the main map rather than attacking in one big push because you just don't have a very big army And it's not that useful to, you know, if you're just doing a weak push Why would you do a weak push if you can do a strong push? You know what I mean? Seven extra ghosts? 13 ghosts This is not TVZ made That's a mistake So if we take a look at the game state right now, you're not actually ahead This game is about even. And although you had a nice early game, if you, don't capitalize and you throw your lead away like you just did with that fight You're not actually that far ahead anymore On top of that, I also believe that you're getting too many workers The maximum worker count that I would say with a Liberator Ghost style, 75, 76, I've watched Maru play this style a lot You know, some kind of tank camping into Liberator Ghost, turrets, that type of stuff You need a big army And those 10, maybe 15 supply, are important That is why you also get the extra command center, which is A, for infinite scans, but B, also for extra money. If you can throw down mules, I'm sorry, don't be sorry, my friend I'm sure, you should actually be sorry for the lack of map vision here That's not very good I don't like that It's not fair The game balance I know I should have lost this game, but Protos is broken very dramatic thing to say, no? It's like a teenage drama If I was the Terran here, I'd be absolutely fuming already Because at this point, Terran is not in the bad spot It's actually kind of fine This army out of Tos really is not that great There's a lot of Arcons in here There's a lot of zealots. If Terran wouldn't have 16 ghosts and just had a more morose, focused army? This would be kind of, okay, why do you have 16 ghosts? Ghosts are not actually that good against Protos You gonna snip zealots? Maybe wants to nuke or something I actually know what these ghosts are gonna do I mean EMP, that's for sure It's much nicer to have a Marauder army with this It's EMPs Look this These aren't still have full health How does that even work? I think he threw like 30 EMPs on this spot It's like EMP on rapid fire or something like that Very impressive Having 16 EMPs Ooh, quick response 60 Oh, I was up with this turret Still quick response Good job Actually, good job. Yeah, 16 ghosts and then still keeping some arcons alive Yeah, the reason why often when you play this style, you don't want to get too many ghosts, at least not 16, is because you also want to have an army on the map, an army on the map to either fight the DTs or to take out outside bases because camping forever isn't actually that great You need to do something at some point You need to start taking good fights You need to also get your liberators in positions eventually That is what Maru does as well when he plays this style. He starts marching around with three Matax with units, two ghosts with it, like eight, nine marauders, and boom, go around the map, start killing stuff Bio trades insanely well against any type of gateway army It trades well against low numbers of disruptors So if you get your opponent to split the army, that is always going to be fantastic Now you're just kind of like a sitting duck He just throws disruptor balls at you and you're not doing anything whatsoever It's literally just waiting You're hoping that your opponent kills himself into you And if he doesn't do that, you can't win this game This fifth base is never allowed to go up, not in a million years. If he lets you take this fifth base, that is a massive error out of him and that is not because you did something fantastic. You're also lacking Sensor Towers. I like that you're getting them now, but it is quite late. You're just sitting here. In your... You were talking about your early game. You never overextended. You heavily outplayed my opponent in every way. I mean, that is just not true. And also, when you say something like this, I feel like you kind of need to give examples. You can't just say, I heavily outplayed my opponent in every way. It's like me saying, I'm way smarter than Albert Einstein. And then the other guy goes, can you give an example? You're like, I'm just way smarter Like, your initial drop was good I'll give you that But the rest of it, I don't think you really outplayed him You've been sitting on four bases now for the past four minutes, building orbital commands and scanning It's not really outplaying APM is pretty equal as well I think the Protos is lacking map vision, but so are you Is this what Terrans consider outplaying? It's just sitting back and not dying It's really not that impressive to not die as a Terran It's the best defensive race Freaking tanks, liberators, boonkers? Just EMP himself? He did kill a lot of DTs again This first time Ten DTs. Not bad I thought I already saw some DTs earlier get taken out but I must have imagined that Ship weapons level 2 on the way, which is good 3-3 on the way as well There's a fleet beacon on the way for your opponent, and he has an infinite amount of stargates I wouldn't mind if you scan your opponent's main base at some point This is something Maru also does He scans to figure out if the opponent is tech-switching or not He gets map control He just, he does things Honestly, you've just been sitting here and not doing things you have 11 Liberators, three tanks, four marauders, seven Marines, and nine ghosts. You know what's kind of funny? If your opponent would max out on 40 stalkers right now, he would probably win because you wouldn't be able to kill the stalkers He'd just blink through the Liberator zones on top of your bio army If you have this many liberators, I just don't think that's actually very good I think 14 might be slightly too many I mean, if you get 10 seats up in a good position, that's probably enough as well You know, like, why do you need 14? It's not necessary Still too many workers as well, especially because you have like eight orbital commands You can definitely start getting rid of a couple of workers Okay, now the tempest are out. You see that? And you're like, oh, crap Actually, hard counters my army So while you were sitting and doing nothing, you basically build up to an insane army that has a counter in either the Tempest or the carrier You don't anticipate for this unit because you have one Viking You do nothing with that army for three minutes And then you're surprised that your opponent managed to find the counter to your army It's like you're playing way too slow with your advantages Like timings matter in StarCraft 2 A liberator is really good three minutes ago It's a lot less good to have 14 liberators three minutes later because your opponent might have a counter available. You're lucky that this Tropos has some slightly debatable control here Because otherwise you probably would be dead You had absolutely nothing against this I like that he's taking out these rocks Moves in with the Tempest as well Ba-di-Buddy-Bah You unseech all of your liberators All good Start Viking production I wouldn't mind getting another starport as well I think it would be a good Oh, you already have them Okay, never mind I said nothing You have triple starports with a reactor you're completely golden Good EMPs here as well It's not that difficult if you have that many Well, actually only have six ghosts left. This is, you know, you're starting to actually build a decent army, except for the fact that you have 16 liberators If this was like eight liberators or 10, I think eight liberators would be plenty If you had eight liberators and the rest of this army was bio, you actually would have a decent army Right now, you have one marauder, five marines and six ghosts You have a very big air army, but you really have nothing on this. ground and it makes it difficult to push forward and difficult to catch anything as well because bio is the only thing that can really catch an arm a couple of disruptions this looks like a good fight for you honestly this is not how the proto should be fighting whatsoever okay this is a fantastic fight if you had any bio whatsoever right now you'd be able to take out well at least this base i think but you have four marines currently i would not suggest continuing attacking I just don't think that is a brilliant plan Your opponent does have good reproduction abilities And at this point, you should be trying to figure out what he's remaxing on. So you make a scan to see if the carriers are building or if he's getting things from the robos You just want to kind of figure out, hey, what's your army going to be like? So you can anticipate what your opponent is going to be doing You're taking extra bases, which is the correct play You gain map control You start taking bases This is absolutely perfect Plantary over here That's good Liberators I wouldn't mind if you just go, why are you building more liberators? You have plenty, my friend You have absolutely plenty liberators You also kind of have to be wondering at this point what your goal is. So is your goal right now to kill your opponent straight up by attacking the main base and taking out the production? Or is your goal to take out bases on the side and win through having way better economy? That is just my question Overall, resources lost look really nice for you, honestly You're down or you're up 9K I wouldn't mind if you continue trading like you have been because you're obviously better at the fights than your opponent Except for this one, I guess Yeah, this is just the issue when you don't have any bio Like you just kind of blinks through You're still winning I don't understand why That's kind of wild. I feel like you shouldn't be winning anymore because you have absolutely no bio army All these liberators are not really, engaging in the fight either You can just blink into this and absolutely destroy you Yeah, okay Now he's going to pick you up completely This was a bad fight This ended up going pretty sour You lost like 4K resources there more than your opponent But you can still remix on Marauder, Marine, Viking, Metafact ghost And I go a little bit lower on the Liberators at this point This is honestly what your opponent has right now is just kind of a weak army The Protos army here isn't that strong There's no disruptors There's no colossi There's no storm There's no splash whatsoever. If you hit one EMP and you have a bio army, you'll kill this every single time He's completely out of cash as well because you're mining pretty fast You have orbital Are you mad? How does this make any sense? You get a planetary here You get a planetary here You definitely should be getting a planetary in the base that is the least defended The planetary is the only thing that's stopping him from sending one zealot and denying this base from mining at any point That's why you get planetaries because zealot run bys would just destroy you otherwise. Sure, if he sends in 12DTs, he's going to snipe this planetary anyway, but that is a huge investment out of him, not only money, but also supply-wise So that's why you get planetaries because you force a big reaction out of your opponent if he wants to take out that base He either needs to go there with the main army, or he needs to send a significant portion of his army there to deal with it You start attacking into the carriers, move forward with the liberators Honestly, it's a fight that has some potential as well I kind of do like that More bio being produced, more Vikings Always need to be careful with the Vikings. Once again, we need to figure out what our opponent is producing If we get a scan right now, seeing no carriers whatsoever, and we already have eight Vikings, we should not be producing more Vikings We already have the tools to deal with what our opponent is doing And you don't need more Vikings It's just, you know, if you're building a house and you're, you finished hammering in all the nails and you know you don't need any nails anymore, then you should not be buying more nails And it's the same here It will just be a waste Getting these extra Vikings And it's not just money Like, money is almost never the problem in these scenarios. It's always supply and it's army composition in these very late game scenarios you really have too many works as well, by the way This is an actual issue as well So that's 10 supply in there You're getting perhaps, what is it, 8, 10 supply too many Vikings here as well So you're just, for no reason, there's 20 supply less in this army And those are the ghosts that you're lacking You don't have a single ghost You have a unit that deletes half of your opponent, literally delete with one click of the button, half of your opponent's shields, or half of your opponents, what do you call it, HP, or the life of your opponent's units Because this is a pure stalker army. If you impede this army, your freaking liberators will be one-shot at them Your marauders will be eating stalker meat for breakfast, and your marines will be dining on the bones of zealots But yet, you decide to not get a single ghost And I don't quite understand why Stim, Stim, Stim Okay, that Disruptor Shot misses you're actually completely winning this game There's no reason for you to be so extremely hurried Three more Vikings on the way as well You only have, what, four MET effects I wouldn't mind more MEDEX, more bio You don't need liberators anymore at this point. You need to probably start denying bases on the left side, while your opponent is denying bases on your right side, start expanding to the left yourself You're already doing that, but you're missing the final step These bases are already, you're most likely not going to be capable of setting them up anymore because you don't have the time to get planetaries there This is a bad fight for you This is a really bad fight for you This is You just don't have enough bio Six more liberators Gigi I'm The worst part is that I'm not even sure that this is completely game over Yes, you have a lot of supply in Vikings, but you have really good production. You have a crap ton of money You have a lot of orbital commands that can help you secure bases quickly with mules Your opponent is running out of mining, and at least, nah, okay, that's not completely true This base isn't even mining yet I'm not even sure if you should have left there I understand why you leave because it's frustrating and there's DTs everywhere You probably could have tried playing this out Like, overall, your traits were better than your opponents Your mining could have been better if you had probably used more mules on one of these bases The main issue that you had wasn't some bad disruptor shots. I don't think there were any disruptor shots that really hit anything because your entire army consisted of air units Like, this is kind of, this is not really engaging the problem of the disruptor This is just dodging it, you know? It's like saying, well, disruptors can shoot up So I'm going to get 17 Vikings and 12 liberators while my opponent has 40 stalkers It's like, yeah, the disruptors aren't going to hit your bio because you have no bio Your opponent admitting that Protos is imbalanced, I'm sure it makes you feel good, but it doesn't really do anything about your terrible unit composition You're completely non-existent mid-game pushers Well, you did one mid-game push when you shouldn't be pushing. The rest of the game, you just set back and let your opponent come back into the game I'd love to say that this game was won because of the imbalance disruptor or because the carriers looked so broken and Storm-owned Vikings Like, Protos blade games can be super frustrating to play against But none of that really happened in this game None of his disruptor shields really connected in a big way with your army Carriers didn't ruin your Viking AI and you couldn't deal with them No, you lost to a stalker army because you had no bio And the counter to stalkers is pretty clear It's ghost marauder So I feel like you just misjudged why you lost. And then you wrote a nice little essay to me, but none of it makes any sense, honestly So, yeah, it's not even that you did a lot of things incorrect You just were too passive and your army composition sucked But we're playing at Grandmaster level So that is enough to lose games If your opponent is somewhat decent, this prodol's somewhat decent So I'm sorry, my friend, this wasn't in balance, but you just suck That's the way life is sometimes That's the way life is All right That's going to be it for me today Thanks all so much for watching I hope you did enjoy it.

        "text": "Dear Captain, Terran defenses are just plain stupid I know I messed up my Roach Rush build a little bit, but one Cyclone completely shut down the entire rush How was that acceptable? I did a decent job hiding the Roche Warren, and that accomplished nothing I immediately tack up the spire Again, the Terran had no idea it was coming, but just a couple of blind turrets and completely shut it down again I took so many good fights and was up on supply for the entire time, It was five base versus two base at one point, and I was doubling the Terran's income But it was just impossible to break the Terran. Every time I wipe his army, he just pump Marine Marauder Medevac like it's free Finally, I took one unlucky fight and got the Terran planetary down to just below 50 HP, and it got repaired back up almost instantly to fool Like, hello? Who thinks it's a good idea to have a base that cannot die, deal a ton of damage, don't need to be defended at all, question mark I outplayed this Terran from start to finish, and yet I still lost the game at the end Terran defenses is just imba P S Terran didn't even make widow mines Don't even get me started with that Name cool cats, race, zirk, leak, diamond It's the MMR's 3 5K, and we're on the North American server. anger of a ZVT All right, cool cats What do we have here? A ZVT on the North American server Diamond, 3 5K MMR Beautiful stuff here We have Kudol That H makes it difficult to pronounce for me A mediocrely dumb Dutch person So we're just going to call him Kudo Loll I think he'll be okay with that Cool Cats It's actually the name of a shop around here Used to be the name of a shop When I was like 10, I always wanted to buy clothes there because they had the word Cool and Cat in there and I like both of these things But I'm not sure if this shop is actually still around. I remember being all the ranks back in the day Let's see if Cool Cats is the same here See, opens up with a pretty standard opener here Hatchery first into a gas, into a Spawning Pool, nothing too weird The Terran opens up with double Supply Depot at the ramp and a Command Center in the main base And Cool Cats will spot the fact that there's no Command Center on the low ground So there's two options right now One, you sacrifice your Overlord in towards the main because you want to know if at least there's a Barracks here The Command Center should be going down at 140-ish If it isn't there once your Overlord arrives, something odd is going on. And you probably want to scout what that odd thing is Like, hey, is there a CC in the main base? Is there a barracks in your main base? Like, am I being two wrecks proxy? But Cool Katz is completely happy with this information It's like, okay, there's no command center Let me throw down a road's warrant And as a defensive to the Roche Warren here could be quite powerful, of course, against the one base play Defense against this Reaper harass in a decent way I'm not quite sure what these links are doing here, perhaps anticipating that the Reaper was going to move up here. But I think they would have been slightly more useful on the low ground defending against the Reaper in the first place You don't have to block this area the entire time But, oh well, it is what it is So Roach Warren has not been scouted so far And he actually mentioned this, that he was pretty proud that he managed to hide the Roe Warren Roach Warren, but he didn't actually hide the Roach Warren The Terran player just wasn't looking for it And, well, perhaps one of the reasons that the Terran wasn't looking for it is because the Terran blindly built a bunker in his main base and is getting a Tech Lab on the factory. Like, I don't think you can brag about hiding a Roach Rush well if your roaches get spotted the moment your roaches pop from your natural Like, that is hiding as well as an elephant hiding behind a pool It's like I appreciate the effort of you putting the road war and in the back of your base and patrolling your links in this area even though the Reaper is here But this is not really hiding it And yeah, I'm just not so sure if you would want to even pull my attention to the point of hiding the roaches if they literally get spotted 40 seconds before they move across the map This guy already has the SUV pulled towards the bunker 30 seconds before. He is so extremely ready He's never been this ready for anything in his life You do mention that the execution of the Roach Warren, what did you call it? Let me just quote you properly here I know I messed up my Roach Rush build a little bit, but one Cyclone completely shut down the entire rush How is that acceptable? The question or the problem here isn't necessarily that your Roach Rush wasn't executed properly, although it probably wasn't executed properly The real issue is that you went for a roach rush against someone that was on one base and you scouted that he was on one base This is a little bit, imagine you're in high school. You go up to your teacher with a piece of paper and you go, sir, sir, my tracing of the Mona Lisa isn't looking too great It doesn't quite look like the Mona Lisa And your teacher goes, well, that indeed does not look like the Mona Lisa, but you're in year three math over here and you're 29 years old I think your poor tracing of the Mona Lisa is the least of your worries And I think it's the same here You're doing the completely incorrect thing You're responding wrong And the fact that your execution of your wrong response is incorrect as well That just kind of adds to the pain But it's kind of irrelevant. You should not be marching roaches across the map if your opponent is on one base If your opponent is on one base, you might want to build some roaches defensively because you don't know what's going on But why would you move across the map? You're upper base All you need to do is defense So just really surprising I mean, yeah, if he gets a cyclone out and you don't have any links, you are like, yeah, you're going to lose your roaches, or at least some of the roaches You don't necessarily need to stay here the entire time You could send this roach in towards the cyclone so the rest gets to escape You can split your army up in two groups. you can use the line of side blockers Like, so far, you've lost one roach and two links And if you would micro your roach, you might be even able to escape here to the watchtower And once you're in the watchtower, there's absolutely nothing he can do But rather than going to the watchtower and safety, you just kind of walk back and forth and let all of your roaches die, which in my opinion is the incorrect call Funnily enough, you even get the cyclone Like, this wasn't even that bad of a trade for you Although you shouldn't have been on this side of the map, I think it ends up quite well. And I believe you're actually quite far ahead because he had like 10 workers pool to repair the bunker in case you moved up So you're actually in a completely fine position Had you spent any of your money during the entire period of this, your third base would have been done already Your fourth probably would be started or practically started You could have had a, oh, you actually have a layer done already Okay, so life is pretty good You just follow this up with two base, two base Murat You get your third base going you're up 10 workers, your opponent has no infrastructure whatsoever, doesn't have a third base yet This is a fantastic position. So although you tried handing in your tracing of the Mona Lisa in a year three math class, you're still succeeding You know, what is it in American terms? Are you a C? Is that good in America? It's like just on the edge I think it's a C In the Netherlands it would be like a six Five and a half gets rounded up to a six That's what I did in high school. and I think in American it's a C or C plus maybe C minus all of that probably is fine I think once you hit a D that is no good and then a E I'm not even sure if they have E's probably and F is terrible is the worst thing F is complete failure it's a weird system with the letters always always confuses me numbers way easier no pluses no minus just decimal point numbers oh Americans always having to mess with everything All right, so your opponent follows this up with four racks into command center with Benchies and Marine Cyclone. Yeah, the build order honestly doesn't make a lot of sense and there's no real threat to you either, so you can just safely drone up Now, you would be aware of this if you would scout or if you would have any information whatsoever, but because you honestly haven't scouted at all so far this game, you have no clue what's going on and you have no clue what your position is either I'm surprised that you just kind of keep building drones, you get the macro hatch, get another hatchery, without knowing anything Like you're being two-based-all-in at this point. Like, you could be getting two-ways-all-in at this point, and it could be hitting right now if your opponent had a tight build order, and what you're doing is building pure muta I would not have been correct, but then again, you have no info, so you don't know what is correct Fort case gets spotted But also, it would be easy here to make fun of the Zirk player I'm getting a macro edge on three bases But I respect this call And I'm going to say it again I say that every time I see something like this, if you are having trouble spending your money in the game, do not hesitate to build an extra hatchery Do not hesitate to build extra barracks. Do not hesitate to add more gateways into your production If you're having trouble spending your money, it is better to spend it in more production So it's easier to spend your money in the future And then once you realize you don't actually have enough money in future games, you can just dial back that amount But it's better to spend it into something than to just have it floating So a hatchery here, although it is not standard and it is not common and not many people do it at the highest level, it's completely fine I don't mind this And I'll never make fun and I'll never say this is a mistake if you're a lower level player and you're doing something like this. If you're trying to play a very optimized build order and you say that this is an optimized built, then I would disagree with that But if you're struggling at spending your money, go ahead Always good in the world I don't give a crap about that So, Ford Base is about to finish up You have your double evo chambers Bailing nest is, I think I saw it Yeah, Bainnest is complete Should start the bailing speed immediately, obviously The moment you're going Mura list, you want to play Ling Bain Mura, as these units complement each other very well Your Muda Lest, Mulek harassed is absolutely nothing. Your opponent, by the way, you said, He blindly built turrets, but I think he scanned because he was aware of the spire And even if it was blind turrets, I mean, if he defends, he defends Why do you care how he got the defense ready? You know, if it's the correct response, then he did the correct response A little bit of Bench here, rats What is this, by the way? Yes Little two gases being added here onto the fifth base Fourth base already saturated, already done You decide to get the double extractors at the fifth, which still has, oh, about about 35 seconds more to build That's fantastic stuff On top of that, well, you're already floating 1,200 gas at this point. You need gas about as bad as I need lip enhancement surgery So maybe try spending your money first before getting more and more gas, especially if you're not planning on adding any extra mutilis into this composition Like if your plan is to completely mess out on mutas at this point, I wouldn't mind it so much You're actually going up to 10 gas already already Holy crap This is really early on a low drone count You need minerals as well Minerals not very often when you're playing mutas are the limiting factor, but if you have this little drones, they can be a limiting factor. And I think right now priority should be to get a lot of banlings out and to just get a buzzing eco Make sure you have plenty of larva Make sure you have plenty of links that you can morph into banlings You can kind of start spending your money because you're just floating an astronomical amount of crap Terran moves in. if you had any bailings ready at this point or you had spent any of your money this would have been an easy defense and here once again i can already hear you replying with but my opponent also has a lot of money's like yes but that's the point isn't it both of you aren't brilliant players but you can't complain about something being completely broken while you're literally floating 3k resources like that's just not how it works yes your opponent is making mistakes but you're also making mistakes and you're making huge mistakes Like this isn't a tiny error, like a small decision that goes wrong Like you're literally floating an infinite amount of resources. And you can observe this issue yourself very clearly as well This is not like you need the input of a professional to figure this out, you know? It's just obvious It's like you're participating in a running competition and you're running backwards It's like you don't need Usain Bolt to tell you that running backwards isn't going to be the most optimal Like most people that haven't even ran in their life can tell you that this isn't optimal Just like most people that haven't played StarCrav yet, we'd be like, well, while spending your money, that would be a good start in improving, no? And indeed, it would have been a good start to improving. But, of course, complaining in a balanced complaint form in an IOTIS is a lot more fun and feels better as well, you know, getting angry at something else that isn't yourself That does tend to work better You know, just deflecting a bit of that blame Taryn actually is macroing it out pretty well You also got rid of a lot of your resources as you just built a crap ton of veins This is the correct call, Ling, Bain, Muralis You haven't used the Muralist to harass in a while That is probably because your opponent built four turrets in the natural And you're like, all right, the ability to harass has now been denied I will never harass again. Not knowing that the third base is completely empty, that you can still pick off depots, you can pick off SUVs, maybe like low marine counts that are being popped out of barracks There's a lot of things you can still do with the Muralis And the Muleus really is just a harassment unit It's nice in an army, but it's not super brilliant Like the bailings and the lynx will provide the majority of the damage output And that's really what you want to be focusing on as well Your creep threat also is completely non-existent, by the way But we'll wait with that as we have a bit of a fight Your bailings are actually connecting with everything This is a complete man. Yeah, this game is over At this point, the only thing you actually need to do is start your two-two upgrades More of like 20 more bailings here and you can probably move command into your opponent's third base with the banlings and win the game So these bains, well, they're going to connect with more Yeah, this is fine as well You kill all the workers Maybe you don't even need the bainlings I think a couple extra bainlings would have been nice, but, I mean, the game is over anyway You're up 30 workers This is the point where you set your five base against two Now, that is a little bit deceptive. I once again have to stop you here because, This base isn't really mining You have 71 workers, which is technically 3 2 base saturation, something like this No, slightly higher 3 3, 3 4 3 3, something like that So it's not really 5 base saturation Also, because you're heavily oversaturated, you're actually barely on like 2 5 base saturation So your opponent has an entire mineral line You're really just mining about 1 5 mineral line more than your opponent, I would say here One and add two, maybe two mineral lines more Because you do have this entire base mining There's like six patches over here and there's four patches here So yeah, it is quite a bit But this is not a crazy amount. You don't have to attack into your opponent, but you can You could also continue upgrading, like I already mentioned, two two It's just an important upgrade Just like every upgrade is important Especially once you get more units, your upgrades are just, it's a very cheap investment for a lot of return throughout the game A unit can be used once and upgrades are always going to be used So I would definitely recommend continuing that It's also just really important against Marines, which have a very high rate of fire to get these upgrades going You decide to once again attack into this position I'm not entirely sure why you decide to go through this little choke. You were just up here and you're like, how could I make this fight more difficult for myself? I could move through the choke at the third base. You run around and then just move through this massive funnel. You'll still get the connections with these Banelings, obviously, because well, all of these Marines are pretty exposed at this point. You do leave the mineral line somewhat untouched, but you have more Banelings, so Lyphon is going to be art. You can just kill every single SCV here, and that's what you'll do. Correct play, honestly. Did lose all of your Mutas, which I don't completely approve of. Let's see that one in the replay because that was a curious one. Okay, one more time. So you blow this up, that was good And then here, right at this moment is where you realized that you have won the lottery Okay, look at this You've won the lottery, you've won the lottery, and you ate the ticket Just like that you ate the ticket Oh no 25 million down the drain And for the next three days, you'll be with a little stick going through your own excrement, seeing if the ticket is still intact Like, what was that? They were connecting They could smell the Marines already, ready to explode, and then they got the order to go back, and the links get sent in as a replacement No, they also get turned back So, you're still very far ahead. Don't get me wrong, but I think this could have been handled slightly better, where you could have killed every single Marine and been in an absolutely un-loseable position 11 more drones, you know, I don't even mind this Just increasing the size of your lead is honestly not a bad call So right now you're playing for a longer game You're playing for a longer game You might want to start working on these upgrades Your fight so far, even though you've said that you haven't lost a fight yet, I think pretty consistently you've been losing more than killing, but because you have such a superior eco, it is kind of okay I would like if you would continue building a couple more banlings, though. Banlings are pretty crucial Any type of map vision would also be nice, so you wouldn't have to deal with any nasty surprises like this one Glyle reconstitution and nine ravers It's a debatable call here as you don't have any attack upgrades for the rafters Maybe you figured out that it's too easy to hit your opponent's army with banlings, and it might be easier to miss your opponent's army with Biles, because that seems to have been the goal so far You do hit the tanks Your Bile control actually is pretty good But balings here would just win Like, absolutely Just destroy this army Just even four or five bailings here would be huge Biles are going to hit, but, yeah, I'm not entirely. I mean, you'll clean up this army again and that's nice, but banlings really are absolutely key in this type of, yeah, there we go, 32 paintings A little bit surprising You also lost this base and you lost like 30 workers You're back on four bases now, but a lot of these bases are semi-mined out You've had no map vision this entire game unless you attack, and then the only bit of map vision you get is basically the area you attack in Once you get the banlings, you're just going to crush another engagement At least get a pretty decent trade here Tanks go down I wish your Muras will still live to kill this. You're slightly up in work because you really need to start re-establishing a fifth base at this point though and probably even get a couple of extra drones Still no 2-2 means that this is a somewhat playable position for the Terran This is a poorly synchronized attack here And a right-click on the planetary without killing the SUVs If this entire attack, now there is a world, there is a, there is a universe somewhere, one of the many universes in our simulated universe theory, one of the many parallel universes, in which all of this engages at the same time Now, I can visually, I can imagine this, you know, I could visualize what this would look like. And in this case, what would happen is you throw the bios on the planet, You use the banlings not only to force the marine marauder into a corner, and then you use the baylings like this, in like a sweeping motion to go into the planetary while killing the repairing SEVs And that is the viewpoint of the banlings in these types of attacks, is to force the SEVs to not clump up around the planetary You can also split the banlings a little bit, that usually is quite helpful If you would have tanked with the Roche Reveger, the planetary shots, your Bainlings might have been able to do that motion. On top of that, you also could have used the Biles to hit the planetary and the SEVs Or at least hit the SEVs, that way the repair isn't possible So there were a couple of options here, but you decided to move command the Bainlings into nothingness, first the links, then the Bainlings, then the Reveragers Like, this is throwing a lead at a very high level Like, I have not seen a throw like this in a very long time And if the 1919 white Sox were watching this, they would be jealous at this skill Because you make it look so natural, so flawless, the way that you lose stuff It really does not feel like you're doing this intentionally. Floating a decent amount of money during this Of course, we still have the 4K gas in the bank as well, always making sure that we have that as a backup In case we need to transition into a unit that only cost gas In case, Zerk gets the Templar archives as one of the many structural added to the race in one of the next patches and the patch goes live during your latter game All of these scenarios are of course very realistic, so we continue our, you know, our gas income rather than long distance mining A couple of extra minerals I missed a fight It doesn't really seem to matter because at this point, you don't actually have the eco. You went for an all-in while you were in a decent position You didn't retake a fifth base quick enough you retook this fifth base after your attack failed Now you're rebuilding on Muda Lists, even though the way that you use the Muda Lisk, this is another point actually that I want to make, is mutalisk are a great unit when you can harass with them or for dealing with drops, that type of stuff This Taryn hasn't done any drops yet, and you don't know how to harass That's fine If you don't know how to harass, once again, that is okay Know your limitations, but don't pretend like your Serral or Rainer or Darry. or Roke or one of the other five top zirks, and that you can use these mudalists to get back into a game through harassment Because I know, and you know, and everyone watching this video knows, that these mutas are going to be put in the same freaking control group as the rest of your army, and it will be used as a mediocre fighting unit with the rest of your army So in that case, these 800-800 would be much better invested into more banlings But rather than doing that, you're pretending like your name is Cyril here, and you're building nine more muta-lisks Also an infestation pit You want to tack into Ultralisks at this point. After having a 50 drone lead, you're like, no, let's stay on 1-1 upgrades and I still 1-1, right? Yep, 1-1 upgrades, pure Ling Bain or Ling Raverager mutalisk This is the timing where you have no eco left and you're under heavy pressure that you want to go into lurkers at this point And a hive is truly unbelievable Ling run by that dealt, what is it, 90 damage on this planetary and lost you about 60 lynx If this trade would have been described in art of the deal, this would have been a very favorable deal for the Terran player, okay? If Donald Trump had played StarCraft 2, this trade would have made it in as a very good, the top deal. The best of the best Not many people can make such a deal Don't forget about that Yeah, I mean, your Lurker transition is just way too late Also, Muda Interlurker isn't very common I would not suggest it, yeah, you're just absolutely dead I mean, he has two units, he's up 80 supply And you lost Yeah, you absolutely got destroyed Now, I could go on a very long rant about the many mistakes you made and point out all the individual mistakes But there really was a couple of common themes throughout this game And I think the three main teams were your vision, your upgrades, your army composition, and your engagements And I'm well aware that that is not three things, but four. So there's four main teams during the game Your complete lack of map vision whatsoever, not taking watchtowers, not knowing when drops from the right side are coming, not knowing when attacks were coming whatsoever, all of these things MapVision was absolutely garbage Creep spread was non-existent, and that kind of adds in the complete lack of map vision as well, but not even taking watchtowers or overlord spreading, which is practically free and also doesn't require too much APM It just was painful to watch You were never ready for a single attack You never had the correct units as a result You never morphed banlings ahead of time either That really did just suck The second point, your fights almost all of your fights were bad. And if they weren't bad, it was because you just A-moved Like, majority of the time, I think the actual control of your units was worse than if no one would have touched it And this is, we actually have a term for this, this is called negative micro It is better if you don't touch it and just A-move. And I genuinely believe this to be the case for probably majority of the Starcraft players, especially for you and I would recommend and this is not a joke or being rude I really would recommend it's just just a moving in the future just a moving your units and then casting the spells afterwards no individual control on bailings not trying to do anything too fancy I believe it would be better for you so yeah on the fights I would say it's not in balance it just you know wasn't great for you then the next two points the upgrades well you never started upgrading past 1-1 You also started building roaches, although you had no range upgrades. Your unit compositions were all over the place in general as well I mean, you went but muta roach rush into muta link-bane, into ravagers, into Lingbane, into link-bane, into muta, into Hydra-Lurker But you never got there So kind of all over the place, not very good Yeah, I kind of forgot my last point already, so we're back to three Congratulations This is how we roll, man Yeah, we put all of these things together I mean, you did nothing better than at a mediocre level So, yeah, terran defenses are not imbalanced You just don't know how to control your army, how to build your army, or how to be in position And thus, my friend, you suck And that's the harsh reality of things. That's how it is All right That's going to be it for me today Thanks all so much for watching if you did enjoy this episode of Is It Inbar, Do I Suck?

        "text": "Race Protos, MMR, 6600, League Grandmaster, server EU and the name is Petit Drogo French Protos player, one of the, in my opinion, top 10 European players currently, and he writes this to me What's up, Kev? Today is the day, the one you've been dreading forever since you started this YouTube series And it's not entirely correct there sure, waking up to a message from Drogo isn't exactly my favorite thing There's a lot of people I would rather get a message from, but honestly getting a Skype notification with a little story in it is not really the day I've been dreading But let's continue You ignore this replay The story ends. You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe about the state of ZVP You watch this replay and I show you how deeply imbalanced Zirk Lategame is We have a famous saying in France ever since the Maginot Line 1940 incident They're going to pass\u00e9 by la Forre six solo which roughly translates to plate perfect still loose I'm no native French speaker but I don't think that exactly translates one-on-one I digress, let's continue I think this saying is fitting here as my German opponent was using an even more broken tactic than the Blitz Creek, Zirk units This game I put on a hard hat and a hammer, like the good working man, and built a beautiful setup for myself. Five bases, extremely good upgrades, and the complexity of my army was good enough to make a tasteless cry I almost won the game after such beautiful play Sadly, in a very lore-accurate way, the Zerk army was overwhelming, and there was nothing I could do Ultralisks and broodlords dominate the ground Corruptors make sure I don't get to build any air units And worse of all, investors indoctrinate my own units, making them fight against their own brothers and sisters I could go on, but the replay will speak for itself So what will it be, Captain? Will he tell the truth to your audience and admit the game is imbalanced? Or will you lie like a coward and tell me I suck? The choice is yours. Petit Drogo P S Yeah, I guess I had a bit too many workers Now, I can't be the only one that spots the irony in a French person calling me a coward, but we'll skip that for now Hop into the game I decided to skip the first two minutes and 34 seconds because I do believe that Drogo is perfectly capable of doing the first two minutes and 34 seconds perfectly He is a professional player that has been playing StarCraft 2 at the highest level for a very long time And he is one of the players that loves playing one style again and again and again and again. And just slightly improving that style again and again and kind of unlike a regular French person, he doesn't actually like cheese that much He is a player that wants to play very solid He'll have build orders that are kind of aggressive But cheese is not something that he has in his toolbox He has a lot of tools in his toolbox and he can play different styles, but the thing he likes the most is perfecting one style and playing that over and over, improving just the tiniest bit every single game So I'm looking forward to a very tight, early and midgame, a very good understanding of what to do in every single situation, and I'm kind of curious how this is going to be. Now the opponent he's playing against is Shopify's Rebellion Lombo, who happens to be my teammate and a good friend as well, one of the best Serks in EU currently, is best performance up to date, is getting second place in the next tournament last year, somewhere in October He beat dark in the semifinals and only barely lost to several in the finals I think it was four to three An absolutely fantastic player, very good theoretical knowledge, solid mechanics as well It's also known as the professor because of his strong theoretical knowledge So this is quite the match here on the I assume this is the European ladder. I haven't seen these two guys play each other in the last, well, a few months, I think, in a tournament or the last few weeks at least But maybe I haven't been paying attention But for all I know, this is most likely going to be a ladder game Drogo opens up by sending a void ray across the map here I think he tried to deal some harassment as well with his adepts But he's killed one worker so far Now, this is a really cool move He pulls the queens away with his void ray, flies in with the Oracle to try and deal some damage. Because at the highest level, it is really common for Zirk players to skip their spoor for as long as possible to get optimal mining So you'll see Lombos skipping spores in two out of the three bases And this Voidre move, which I think most of us got introduced to by Zest He was someone that initially loved doing this, especially with double Stargate openers, send in one Voidre and then the Oracle, bam, can kill some workers It did kind of work out Three workers have gone down And the Voidre is in a bit of an awkward position, but this seemed to be the plan for Drogo So I'm just curious what he's going to be doing there I could say, well, terrible. This is going to suck with any type of Ling defense and you have Ling's attack and you need to defend them But this is obviously a very conscious play out of Drogo He understands what he's doing I'm just curious what his actual plan is going to be with that void ray There is a forge and a twilight before the robo Before the queen nerve, where the transfuse was still possible of creep, this would have been considered a very, very risky play because opening up with not a robo, not straight up rushing into disruptors, was basically a death sentence against any type of queen push. But nowadays, as queen pushes have become rarer and rarer, getting these quick upgrades has actually, well, I don't want to say become the norm, but has become extremely common in this matchup So it's cool to see Drogo also opening with that He's been honestly been doing a good job Killed four workers so far Seems to have good information of the layer timing, knows that there is a fort base And this is kind of what you expect out of Drogo He just completely understands what he is looking for in the early game, what he wants to be doing when he scouts something slightly out of the ordinary This Voidre from the back is coming back in. I think it didn't manage to kill a work here At least forced a sport to be built It's just really cool Kind of that play between the Oracle and the Voidre The Voidre coming in from one direction and the Oracle coming in from the other direction Really keeping Lombo busy here Lombo only on 69 workers so far And Drogo is just kind of being passive, not wanting to attack before he has his setup As he mentioned in the balance for me, so he said, I got a really good setup in the early game I was happy with what was happening He gets a double scout off as well He has triple sentry, so he's going to be scouting for days here. Oracle can get the Revelation, sees more drones moving towards that fourth base. Double hallucinations are now moving in as well. We'll just be rallied over these bases, trying to figure out what tech it is that Lambo is going for. And he spots the spire here. Lambo already was getting an extra gas. We probably just wanted to build eight or nine mutas into Ravager Ling Bane. This Void Ray is doing a decent job against the spire, though. And I do like this. Honestly, so far, Drogo is playing a fantastic game. He scouted absolutely everything. Now, I don't want to say this is the perfect game so far, but if he loses in the next 20 seconds, I'd say, yeah, played perfect, still lost. The French saying here is pretty darn accurate He gets the spire, only a single muta gets built, and immediately Drogo is already transitioning into triple Stargate as well as a Fleet Beacon Now, there is perhaps one point where I'd have a small criticism here is why is there no plus one on the way yet? I feel if you want to transition into a fast triple stargate, getting a slightly faster plus one, and also taking the gases before your fort base finishes, would probably a wise play Drogo has scouted or should have scouted the drone count on the fort already, and probably should have scouted this extra gas as well, should somewhat be aware of what's kicking off. I feel like these gases should have been taken slightly earlier, and the plus one should have started Now, this is of course a little bit nitpicky, but once again, this is 6 6K MMR Drogo is absolute top 10 player in Europe Details matter And honestly, not much has been happening So there's no reason for it not to have gone correctly He seems to be prioritizing Phoenix production right now, although he just took out the spire I guess he was afraid of like 12 mutas being built just before the spire got killed Now he'll see that's only a single muta I wouldn't mind if he cancels this phoenix There's no need for three phoenixes in this case I don't believe at least. Gas is really quite late, almost delayed by 30 seconds or so That's a decent amount of gas We don't have enough gas mining here at the third base either As for some reason, there was only one dude in this gas, two dudes in the gas So we lost a lot of gas mining And as a result, we really see that the gas mineral balance is just that tiny bit off here You know, there's only 200 gas in the bank is continuing upgrades as well for the ground Then the question to me is, what are the triple stargates for? You know, if you're planning on going for a quick carrier rush, that's fine. But then why are we also rushing out the shield weapons? Why are we also trying to get so many, well, maybe Immortals isn't even too bad, get some extra DPS, not that gas intensive But I'm kind of doubting the shield weapons here if you want to go for some type of quick carrier play and otherwise just delay your Stargates a little bit There's nothing wrong with that Or start with two stargates, double carrier, put a lot of chrono boost on that, and just do like a quick five carrier push So you add your third stargate after the first two carriers basically finish. There's a decent amount of money in the bank, and this might look bad, the fact that he was floating 1600, but that's actually not necessarily a mistake Very often for ProDos, the decision is waiting with money to get another base or adding more cannons, or building zealots if there is a need to build zealots However, in an army composition like this, there is no point in spending your money just to spend the money And I see a couple of you gold and bronze and platinum guys thinking right now, oh, I can flow 2 5K and it's no problem No, it is no problem if you're not being attacked. Because adding 25 zealots on top of this army is actually useless because it would just make banlings, which Zirks should always be capable of building, because there's always going to be a bailing nest, would just make the bailings a lot more useful against an army like this So you only want to be building zealids in two situations One, if you have a prism in their main base or you're doing a major run-by towards a base, and two if you're under attack and you need a quick reinforcement And perhaps you can do one or two extra waves of zealots before If you scout something like that, you can still use some in a run-by. So even if you see Drogo floating minerals here, that is not actually a mistake So so far he's been playing a fantastic game Like really almost no mistakes His unit control has been close to perfect He's lost one immortal I'm not quite sure how that happened I'm afraid that it might have been rallied across the map And he's lost a single adept He'd all the fair amount of damage He killed a spire, killed seven drones, killed two overlords Perhaps one point of criticism is that he hasn't been capable of clearing any creep But at the same time, the creep spread also isn't massive and impossible to clean up later on There is no observer yet, and that does worry me a little bit. because the moment these first three carriers are going to pop will be the first timing where Drogo actually has a little bit of map control And with that little bit of map control, he should be capable of clearing a fair amount of creep at least around the basis You want to be clearing all the active tumors, which makes it really difficult for the Zirk to kind of start respreading again The queens need to start moving there That can be scary There's only seven queens total So there's not even that many queens to respread everywhere and not having any type of major splash in this army as well. I understand it because he didn't have that much gas, but right now the gas is available to at least start storm, I would think He's nearing max as well Like, if you look at an army that is maxed, you always want to think, what is the easiest way to improve it without spending a lot of supply? So if you could spend every little bit of supply, you could say, well, you'd get rid of like 20 zealots and you replace that by eight carriers That would obviously improve that army However, in this case, it's already maxed You want to slowly get rid of the zealots It's not like you're super rich yet So you get rid of four zealots at a time maybe. And in this way, a good way to improve this army would be to just add three or four Templar, get storm, and that would increase the power, the damage output of this army by so, so much, so much more than any other sick supply possibly could at this moment There's no other sick supply investment that can be built with the money that Drogo currently has that would have as much of an impact as getting Storm and three more Templar Sure, Storm has a decent research time, but with two chronobust on it, it's really only about a minute, 59 seconds, I believe So, yeah, I don't know. I feel like that would be a very good solution to the problem of not being capable of increasing this army currently It also could just be used as a transitional tool If you know that you want to fight right now, you might want to be getting storm ready for the next push This is These zealots are absolutely blitzing in there This is not the way you want to engage, Drogo You know that, I know that I'm not going to pretend like this is a good fight Zellets are a big part of your damage put in this army You have nine of them, 10 of them You sent all of them forward like a bunch of idiots. You don't have an observer with your army, so you're not even killing creep There's no Oracle for Revelation either Well, you have an Oracle, but you're not using the revelation on the creep or on his army And you just move command, these zealads into his banlings He has to spend a minimum amount of banlings, the smallest amount of banlings, to kill all your zealots So the job of the banlings practically has been done already Fantastic job You just made his life a lot easier for no real reason, not having an observer with this army, not having a prison with this army Like, these are obviously very big mistakes It makes it impossible to reinforce this position It gives your opponent free vision. Why would you give your opponent free vision if you don't have to? These are big mistakes and they're rather obvious I find it difficult to believe that you believe that your play is perfect at this moment There's obvious errors so far Now, you're going to set up another run by This is what tens up And I like this You're slowly getting rid of crap units like zealots And the control on them is not very good But I can kind of forgive that as well Once again, no observer with this army means that this creep still gives vision, makes it difficult for you to do any aggressive rotations without being spotted I'm not quite sure why you would want this creep to still exist. You're also not aware of where his army is exactly You don't have storm in this army yet These are, we could have started storm, legit a minute and a half two minutes ago would have been capable of having this army All of this creep could have been gone Now Lombo gets a way better fight than he probably ever should have with a pure Roach corruptor army I mean, you had a massive army You had a great composition A couple of your zealots did get through, but it looks like they're getting F-toothed back home Now they end up going here towards this hatchery. The fight so far just haven't been brilliant for you, but despite that you're not even that far down in resources lost Pre-broodlord investor viper is really difficult for Zerk to get cost-efficient fights, honestly It just doesn't happen because their main tool is going to be the banling, and the banling inherently is a cost- inefficient unit So, so far, I'm not a huge fan of what you've been doing The fact that you're losing more than your opponent in these fights show that the fights haven't been going too great Now, Brutlards are coming out, Vipers are coming out Your plan is to still go for this push, So you're setting up for a carrier void ray-ish like push. I do like that you're continuing upgrades very fast, by the way I'd like to make a quick note of that The double forge is really going to be paying off soon, especially in these like, whenever you play a late game against the Zirk, eventually you're going to get little skirmishes on the sides of the map Zellets, Arcons, or maybe just pure zealots, maybe a prism in a main base at some point or, well, not a run by into 12 spines, but probably mainly going to be focused on the right side and having these extra upgrades on the Zellets, and if there's an Arcon in there, go to be absolutely massive against Link So I'm a very big fan of this. I think it's cool Did delay your initial move out a bit, and I still feel like that your storm has been too late But, I mean, these are mistakes of the past Let's focus on the now We live in the moment, and in this moment you're making some darn good decisions The only thing that I really dislike is that this observer has been so slow I really think this has been one of your biggest mistakes, and also just not knowing where his army is, the majority of the time, could have been a lot more painful if you were slightly more out of position His paling run by is going to go in I think they don't even have plus two yet. Get a nice violent wall here, Drogo Very good Good warpin as well Man, this was, I just kind of want to go back here This was fantastic Look at this This actually was really cool because Drogo kind of gets called off guard I don't do this thought in I oldest, you know? I hardly ever get to highlight any cool place Drogo gets caught of guard a little bit here, you know? But he immediately realizes that he's being jupped And his response against this bailing run by is honestly close to perfect He doesn't have energy for a recall He's like, hey, banlings, I don't want them to reach into my mineral line, throws down the pylon here These banlings are a little confused. You see there's some weird aim moving going on out of Lambo Now Lambo realizes, and then you get the good stalker warping just there in the end A couple of stalkers do end up falling, but majority of the probes stay alive And right now, with this move, and although Drogo initially got caught out of position, he now actually has some leverage to start moving across the map and maybe deal some actual damage And once again, once you are allowed to step on your opponent's creep, it's really nice if you can clear this creep And this time with the observer, that's actually going to be possible So it's great to see that. I obviously would have loved to at the same time have some type of secondary play here, Drogo I know you're capable of shift-clicking zealots into bases I've seen you do this many times in the past And having just a little one-sided affair here makes me sad I think getting five zealot in towards this base, even running them down here or down here, would have been super helpful It just forces your opponent to spread the attention You don't really need to control the zealots They work by themselves You know that I know that I also wouldn't mind if you send this prism into the main base with like four zealots, then pop it back down immediately. You know, these very small moves cost very little effort for the Protols and cost a lot of effort for the Zerk to kind of fight off Use this prism well Okay, now in this type of fight, I usually believe the correct play to be to focus down Brut Lords There's only eight Brut Lords You have carriers with plus two and there's no, there's one Carapace upgrades on the Brut Lords So in this case, you could have focused down the Brutlords But let's just slowly go over this fight again and actually take a look at what these carriers are shooting at. This is why I think one of the most important things with this type of five, six, seven carrier push is to have a separate hotkey for the carriers So once the interceptors are out, you can actually start shift clicking down Brutlords The moment Brutlords disappear from this army, let's just take a look what you're actually fighting You're going to be fighting 26 links and 14 corruptors Now, both of these units have one very hard counter, and that is the Arcon And you have plenty of arcons You can even warp in zealots against it, honestly as well, especially with the upgrades that you have, right? You have fantastic upgrades This guy only has, what, plus one. He's going to get 2-1 soon on his links You're working with 3-2 already with Shields Like, if you clear the Brutlords here, this game is 100% over But let's zoom in and see what these carriers are actually focusing on So one carrier here, look at spreading the wealth to this spore, Spore under some heavy fire from this carrier Really cool I'm glad to see that happen And we see the spine crawlers It's taking some heavy damage Brutlings are being attacked A second carrier decides to also send these interceptors over towards this left side So we already have two out of the five just attacking spores on the left side that wouldn't even be in the fight if the carriers wouldn't be attacking it. Now, the spine crawler is going to fall faster than it ever would have expected to fall We have a carrier now attacking one of the queens as well more broodlings going down Not a single carrier out of the five carriers is attacking these broodlords The only real source of damage that can clear the ground At the end of the day, the only thing that matters for you is making sure that you can win the ground fight And if you kill the brute lords, that happens He'll need to move more of more brute lords and you already have blink on the way So you're somewhat prepared for that transition It's obviously absolutely terrible target fire. And now finally you start going after the brute lords You'll get, what, one, two, back to the queens, and back onto the spores You saw how quick these two Brutelords died You could have done that once, like at the point where you still had all interceptors in the carriers, you probably could have just sift-click down I think every single Brutlord before your carriers would have fallen Now you're forced to recall At the end of the day, you still had an okay fight, but there were no run-bys going on during this There was nothing in the main base either So you cleared one base, you had somewhat of an okay fight, but I think this could have probably been somewhat of a winning fight. Had you microed that at all, there I say? Because this felt more like an A move. There were, of course, some focus fire. There were some decent storms being thrown down as well. You were focusing a lot on the Vipers, but there was a lot of potential in that fight, and it did not get used. It really did not get used. Warp Prism towards the main. Now, this is the time type of move that I would absolutely love if the year was 2010 and you were in bronze. Nothing is currently happening in this game. You're playing against one of the best Zirk players in all of Europe and you think that this prism, after seeing that there's 14 corruptors, is going to get into the main base? Of course not, mate Like, what type of wishful thinking is this? You're just straight up rallying into his aliens Are you joking? Come on, Lombo Turn around Kill him Make the point for me Make the point for me, Lombo Well, good control on the prism, Drogo I'm proud of you Lombo didn't want to make the point for me But, yeah, I'm not going to criticize That was good control of the prism You knew what you were doing You thought there was an opportunity I take everything I said back Almost everything. Good job All right Next push here, as we have Okay, how many broodlords are there? Let's just take a look at the army before the fights here Okay, so what should be the goal in these fights? Nine broodlords in the sky, 17 corruptors in the air, a lot of stalkers out, a couple of ultrass Are there any immortals? Two immortals in the battle as well So once again, the moment you kill the Brutlords here, the game pretty much ends So that should be the focus, or if you don't want to kill the Brutlords, you just dodge the fight Good blink sucks that you got blinding clouded on, but the correct call, honestly, is to just target these down. Now, your carriers attacking Ultralis and spores over the Brutlords is a well makes absolutely zero sense attacking ultras with interceptors that is the definition of doing nothing you know it is like now imagine there are two jobs that need to be done drogo and for your sake I'll pick something that you'll be familiar with the first one being getting a white flag from your shed in which you store the white flag and the other one would be digging a trench at the French German border so if he has decent two jobs and the two tools we have are one is the key to the shed where we store our white flag and the other two is a massive shovel and in that case you try to open the door of your shed with the shovel and dig the trench with the key that would be considered ineffective. The same is the case here in this fight If you're using your carriers to focus down Ultralis while your immortals are taking out Brutlings, these units aren't being used as efficiently as you could And that tends to be bad So we'll continue in this fight I still believe you're winning this fight because the fight honestly was quite good You're very decisive in your fights You know quite often when to take them well But the actual infight execution seems to once again be kind of lacking But you kind of win the game here You're extremely far ahead You clear everything. your prism is slightly suicidal here but luckily you have a second prism so you just warp in like in my opinion four arcons eight zealots or so how many gateways do you have 13 gateways and you should be fine ah ah very smart look at this this is uh this is uh this is also understandable this is a very understandable and i'll explain you guys why So right now, what happened here is Drogo seized this prism, but it is resting And Drogo assumes that it is currently on strike, as a lot of public services in France usually are on strike He's like, ah, you know, I probably can't use it So instead, he just uses the pylon at home. I also like that he uses the pylon that is probably one of the furthest away pylons from the battle Rather than going to the fort base or going to this base, he decides, no, the natural is where I want to be warping in my stalkers need to move over to the battle for another 10 extra seconds Very good call, Drogo I appreciate the, you know, keeping your units fit, making them walk a lot as well There's what, 14 stalkers it was not 13 stalkers Imagine that this currently has 13 extra stalkers That would have been a lot of units That would have been absolutely fantastic You probably would have been able to just completely destroy everything. I like the target fire with the immortals Pretty good Yeah, 13 extra stalkers would have just straight up won you the game in this fight Now the stalkers are going to be Are going to be arriving after the game pretty much ends Or not the game ends, after the fight pretty much ends You still, however, have a lot of money in the bank You cleared two bases Did you clear any major tag? You didn't really But I still believe you're in a good spot One of the reasons being that your probe count is so insanely large Now that, of course, has disadvantages as well as advantages The disadvantage being is that your maximum out army is weaker. The advantage being is that you seemingly have a never-ending supply of money You're not actually outmining your opponent currently As Lambo also has a decent amount of workers and you were transferring a couple of dudes Yeah, it's unfortunate that you haven't cleared the creep in the middle yet It's actually kind of starting to piss me off The amount of space you're getting to clear creep and you're not taking that opportunity to do it Because just because you're lacking an observer There's no real other reason at this point except you're just not having an observer That is nothing but a mistake here, in my opinion I can't imagine a scenario in which an observer would not have been good in this entire game. The game kind of stabilizes, and I really like the things you're doing here So you're pre-splitting your army, you're adding a lot of immortals into your army, realizing that your opponent has a lower Brutlord count at this point So you have the Stalkers to one-shot Brut-Lord You want to just blink in, kill four, three, four Brut-Lort Lords really rapidly, so only one or two remain And at that point, your ground army will obviously do the rest This is a very sound approach, honestly I don't see anything wrong with this whatsoever I like the creep cleaning I think this is good The double armies make it difficult for Lombo to truly, you know, to truly figure out what's going on. Once again, if you had an observer here with this army, that would be even better Don't forget that killing creep really has two benefits One, units aren't quick and also they don't have vision, making aggressive rotation so much harder to deal with for the Zirk player And so the longer the creep is there, the more vision they're going to be getting Look at that Get so much vision for a Zerk And as a result, you see this entire moving on If there was a, here, just look at what happens here I'd just like to stress one more time. If these creep tumors would have been cleared before, Lombo did not have vision of this ramp, These links might have just joined up with this main army But instead what ends up happening here is you walk over creep Look what Lamo does as a response He starts building I think it's about 15 12 banlings immediately Maybe he builds 12 banlings because he's afraid of dying It's also possible but he could have responded to this And I think in a way he pretty much is His Brutlords are going to be pushing you back for a little bit You realize right now that there's probably more Brutlords than you imagined And at this point I think a switch into Tempest would probably be a correct call. I love these rumbis with Storm, by the way They're so good Storm against Link Bain is, I don't want to say broken, but I mean, if you're a zircling and the other guy has storm, you don't want to be a zircling anymore, and you wish to be morphed into an ultralist when you were just a little cocoon or a little larva Good movement as well Oh, uh Oh, Drogo O Drogo, that was not a good move So you have 15 stalkers here in this army and I like this movement overall and I even like the idea of sniping investors. But if you're not planning on split-shotting investors with your stalkers, just blink in five stalkers to one-shot these investors and you'll be absolutely fine as well You can do it multiple times with multiple groups of five You have 19 stalkers You could make three groups of five out of that and one group of four How great is that? I did finish my elementary school so I know all of these things Now what's going to happen is you jump every single stalker forward He throws down one fungal Sure, you kill three investors, but you also would have killed these three investors with just five stalkers So there's absolutely no need to lose all of these stalkers. Now, you still have an observer in this army, which is good All the investors do end up dying You actually take a fantastic engagement here That's actually crazy And although you lost like 15 stalkers for free and you do get a couple of your arcons taken, it honestly felt like this was the best you ever could have hoped for in this engagement after that start So Lombo kind of doing you a favor there I would really like to see some tempest being added at this point, though You need to get back into air because without Tempest is just correct here. It's either Tempest or back into Carrier, which is technically also possible, but because you're playing against someone that has ultras, having a good ground army usually is best So the way that that works is that if you're playing carrier, your ground army often sucks because carriers get better the more you have But with tempest, there's pretty much a limit to how many you need somewhere between five and seven Most players agree on So you don't really want to get more tempest than that But with carriers, if you can get 15, you don't really want the ground army That makes it difficult to fight ultra investor armies at times Oh, my good Lord That was a huge fungal Quick response on the recall. but obviously not great that it happens This is a good attack, though I'm not quite sure if they ran by I'm going to check They just ran by This is good play This is really good play And this can only happen because there's no creep Lombo is completely blind here, and these cellas just go in And I'm not saying that this winshoot a game or save your game, but I think this is definitely a contributing factor in helping you stay alive. If this doesn't happen, you're not going to be dying here, but we would see a split off of maybe two ultras, 12 banlings, trying to attack a right side base, a couple of bains maybe moving towards this base or some links here Now Lombo is forced back completely The only reason this happened, once again, is because you took out the creep and you got in So this was absolutely huge And this is kind of what I always want you to do, Drobo I always want you to have these roundbys that don't get spotted by creep Because that just makes life so much easier for you It really does Mothership on the way, I like that a lot. Providing invisibility for your army is great, fantastic Another thing, by the way, I want to pay attention to that I haven't really mentioned yet, is that I really enjoy Drogo SimCity in general This right side wall was good We saw some semi-walls over here, which saved them earlier in the game I wouldn't mind some continued walling over here as well, just a little bit, you know I definitely think that could be somewhat helpful But yeah, this prism is going to keep flying You could try to go for prism speed if you're a true try-hard You want to get a Robo Bay invest in that But if you don't want to do that, I'm also fine with it, Drogo. You know, I'm on your team here You don't have to do it I like the Oracle, double oracles as well, maybe even triple oracles in case you lose one or two And this would be the first time where I would truly say, hey, the probe count is a bit much right now We're oversaturating bases We want a bigger ground army We see Lombo is dialing back the amount of drones that he has as well so his army supply is growing bigger and bigger As a protos, you always kind of want to be matching what the Zerk does You either want to be lower on Worker Count or you want to be equal, but you never want to be higher in Worker Count. I don't think so at least This is my opinion Of course, you can disagree with it But I think the majority of the time, there's no view in the late game to be higher in Worker Count than a Zerk So you could move out of Lombo this run by the way, kind of realizing he's, he's doing similar things here what Drogo was doing earlier with that Zellat runway just forcing your opponent back This base is really important right now for Drogo And this type of play forces him to just go back home or to just try and straight up engage into this army forcing the run by back home. I like this palsy play here out of Drogo identifying that there's not that many sports here and just start shooting immediately How many Templar are we at? We're at five Templar Three of those Templars are at home No, one of those Templars at home This is a really good start of a fight, honestly And if he just plays this out somewhat patiently with the constant use of these tempest here, I think Drogo is going to be in a fantastic spot He could definitely, you know, he could keep shooting for a while He has infinite vision with the oracles If he just clears these tumors, look how little vision Lombo has This is the hardest part for Zirk is all units are invisible. He's not moving on your creep, so you can't even see the shimmer This means that every shot comes out of the dark and tempest out range absolutely everything You need to abuse this harder At this point, I also wouldn't mind if you still have any zealots in this army Even if there's not zealots in this army to just send like a couple of zealots over here, some zealots here to clear these buildings or maybe try to clear this, you know. This is the moment where if you would have 15 less supply in workers and that would be seven zealots or like five zealots and two dTs, that would be super useful in this type of scenario because it's really difficult to deal with if you're under a lot of pressure as a Zirk So, oh, this is a classic Now, this is one of the most frustrating feelings is that you hit the feedback as the viper at the same time also hits his abduct And here something happens, which can only be described kind of as the sunk cost fallacy of StarCraft 2 So we see that Drogo already feels invested in this fight and believes that he can still save this mothership. Now, this mothership is worth 800 resources Don't get me wrong It's an important unit and I'd like to see it back And if you can save it, you probably want to save it But it gets pulled in, face first, into an army with corruptors, infestors, a bunch of Brutelords, some ultras This Tempest army, the main purpose of the tempest is to fight long-range fights over an extended period of time You want to be sniping single units again and again and you want to deny your opponent from engaging immediately The longer you can stretch out the fight, the better it gets because you have the range advantage So here Drogo gets tricked by Lombo into actually moving into this position. Drogo semi-saves the mothership, but gets into a fight where he didn't want to be in Infestors can throw their Neurals Ultras get pretty decent, what you call it? surface area and literally every single Archon fights for the wrong side here Like this is a classic case of losing one unit that he cared too much about And then losing his entire army trying to get the unit back, that already died And often that is the mothership It is such a good bait because it's the most expensive unit and you do start to feel a little bit attached to it as a Protoss player But this obviously was the worst fight that he could have hoped for. Yeah, so instead of just getting a minus 400, 400, 400, or minus 800 resources total He actually gets a complete crap fight and loses his entire army Loses a lot more than just 800 resources So now Lombo is actually in a leading spot And it's funny that Drogo right now is like, oh, crap, my freaking tempest, terrible unit, can't win a fight with it But before this fight, before Drogo got tricked into the fight, he actually was winning this He completely pushed back everything There are no spores remaining whatsoever on the map these bases were completely open Drogo is out mining his opponent in a big way The only thing that happened here is that he got impatient. Now, usually the only thing that French people get impatient for is raising the white flag, but here Drogo got too impatient and actually just engaged into a fight A mistake, a major mistake that obviously has the potential to change the outcome of the game But because his work account has been so large and because he's been mining well, He hasn't lost any of the bases to run by Drogo is still in somewhat of an okay position I just don't like the transition into carriers too much I really believe that continuing the Tempest route here probably would have been correct It is a difficult choice to make. And I also understand that he's warping out a lot of gateway units because he wants to hold his base for as long as possible A couple of fungles are going to hit on these stalkers Makes life a lot harder We have Templars in a prism not capable of doing very much Neural parasite on an arc on as well I think Drogo right now is kind of defending a position that doesn't really require, well, it shouldn't probably be defended here I get some insane storms, by the way, on this army But in an effort to save a 400 mineral structure, I think he's throwing away a big portion of his ground army. And his carriers actually coming kind of clutch, I have to admit, did not quite expect that Maybe is Lombo, actually, who kind of overcommits into this position now There's microbial shroud being used as well I still think there's an okayish fight here for Lombo It's not the most brilliant, but yeah, it just ends up even fine Yeah, I think it might have been better here for Drogo to return back to this base with the probes and to take this later on There's really no way Lombo is going to stay here for much longer, right? It's too split You can't defend both of these sides I don't think so, at least Maybe I'm wrong. I'm not entirely sure what would have been the correct call here, honestly It's a really difficult call to make because you just lost a really big fight in which you lost every single area So I don't want to make any big statements there It's a difficult call I wouldn't have tried defending it I would have evacuated my workers, build up another Air Force and tried from there Because right now it feels like you're pretty all in on a semi-ground carrier army And you also really didn't defend the base anyway So you find yourself in the same situation Of course, you don't know the outcome of the fight before you take it So it is a little bit unfair to judge it like that. because I have just more information than Drogo had when he made that call in the game At this point, I actually believe the game is pretty over Because you don't have the army to break this position You don't have the money to run by towards the left And that just means that Lombo can start pushing forward here There's no real potential in these armies that you're building right now I mean, the game is over It really just happened in one bad fight And that's just how PVZ works And, well, it wasn't really the one bad fight We had two bad fights before that as well. But the one bad fight really was the, well, kind of the final, the straw that broke the camels back, as we say in English You know, you have your French sayings, play perfect but still lose, but we also have some in English And it definitely was the straw that broke the camels back Or maybe trying to defend this was You're absolutely dead And I admire your ability to stay in a game where you've absolutely lost Your Star for spoken for it a little bit Nexus at the 3 o'clock Not that Bad, not bad I mean, it is just over We can kind of move forward Lambo is so patient with this as how look at that. I'd absolutely be just rushing in with my old trials It's even moving his spines forward Loveo is such a tryhard sometimes I'm going to flame him later on Skype today This is a little bit pathetic I should have just A-moved into this Come on, you have queens Morve some broodlords into your opponent's face Finish the game, Lamo Groo said, come on Unbelievable Well, he's going to take out this base I actually can't believe how long Drogo stays in I would have left five minutes ago after I loved the middle five I really admire the grid Gigi as well Drogo leaves the game There were no observer So it probably was a latter game indeed So I was correct in that. And yeah, let's just kind of go over your thing again Let me open my Skype because Drogo as the privileged programmer that he is, didn't need to fill in a Google form He actually just messaged me on Skype with an entire three-page essay I'm not even sure what he complained about Ultralis can brute lords dominate the ground Corruptors make sure I don't get to build any air units And worst of all, investors indoctrinate my own units Now, the only time we've really seen the investors be super useful was in that final fight And that was because Drogo attacked into a position where he never should have attacked into We tried to defend the mothership that already was a goner. I don't think investors are very broken at all You can feedback them, you can storm them, they have extremely low HP, disruptors are very powerful against them They're practically static units the moment they use their neural as well Tempest outranges absolutely everything Feedback outranges the Vipers as well, or the same as Vipers, so it should be absolutely perfect Like if you micro a Tempest Army correctly, like you were doing before the one mistake that you made, I don't think any of these units are much of a problem You never had any major issues with the ultra list The only time you had an issue with the ultralist is when you blinked in 16 stalkers to snipe two investors. They got fungled and yeah, well, if there's, if you're standing still in front of an ultra, he's pretty, you know, he's pretty darn powerful He's just going to, he's going to punch hard, you know, but if you're running away and if you're kiting, which you could have done with your stalkers or you could have done with your immortals, and you did a lot of the time in this game as well, I don't think there much of an issue Lambo didn't even make that many corruptors At times, he had 16, 17 corruptors never much more than that Your air army never was in any major trouble until you just accept the time where you just decided to fight into bad positions. I think this game wasn't really that bad Like if you look in this game, it is very clear that the fights that you take are often good, a lot of fights that you take, but the actual infight execution of the micro is a little bit lacking The carrier targeting is really mediocre well, practically non-existent, Brutelards just get to live their life I think you're too aggressive with Tempus often, wanting to straight up go into a fight where you're not really abusing the range and the main advantages of the tempest, which is the range in the fact that they can one-shot any air unit Once you get like six or seven out, can one-shot Brutlords, one-shot Vipers, one-shot corruptors. And if there's no spore for us, like there wasn't in this game, it shouldn't be an issue I don't think I am a coward for telling the truth I think one of the most important things is speaking the truth at all time, Drogo, especially when you're being peer pressured by people of the same faction as you And that is what's happening right now And I'm not going to fall for it I don't think this was imbalanced I also don't think you suck, but I do believe that you sucked harder than Lombo in this game and that he deserved the win And that's my verdict You suck Harder than Lombo Thanks all so much for watching. Thanks to Drogo for sending in the replay as well and providing me with some reading materials before heading to bed Very kind of him sending me that little essay that he wrote I'll see all of you next time for a new video I hope you did enjoy this If you did, don't forget to hit the like button Subscribe to the channel and follow Drogo on Twitter as well His Twitter will be in the description He is generally very funny So, yeah, thanks off for watching Bye-bye Thank you."

        "text": "Dear Harsdom, I think lurkers are completely imbalanced I'm going to be specific here, however I think that lurkers take far too little skill to use compared to how difficult they are to counter I don't think they're overpowered outright, but I think that much like carrier slash high templar spam, the fact that dealing with them is so much harder than using them and there is such a thin margin for error makes these units imbalance This replay is from a tournament, so my macro and micro are necessarily worse after playing many, many games on the trot But my opponent is the same MMR as me We should be on an even playing field But we aren't His army remex is faster It costs less, etc. This is all fine I have no issues with it This is how Zirk as a race are designed The thing I take issue with is Lurkers being such an incredibly easy-to-use version of the siege tank Look at how the finals of IAM into TVT but with bugs and abduct wars instead of tanks and matrix, with lines of lurkers spamming at each other like bots in a YouTube comment section When it comes to using tanks, you have to think I absolutely cannot just F2A move and siege them on top of my enemy like a mass lurker comp can Let's take the fight at around 13 minutes as an example of my specific point here My opponent suicides his army into a Terran siege line. that he can get a flank A misplay I wipe him, F2, and then try to extend my siege and control of the map to his triangle 3rd My logic with display is that if I can take an aggressive position and force him into dealing with me, as I start to destroy specific hatcheries and control the choke out of his main and net, I will force him into expanding to other harder to defend places Once that's done, we'll enter late-game Terran v Zerk, where I can mess a liberators and make his life harder then finally go for the throat after simply trading better But I make my own misplay. I overstim, over-extend and wind up losing everything, needing to fall back as the Zerk is now very far in the lead From here, I totally lose control of the game He is able to inflict damage for free, and I lose, taking third overall in the tournament Good job on that, buddy Congrats But think about this Before that fight, I had to play slowly and carefully around his mass lurker forces I have to siege and unseege liberators, play carefully, slowly, never exposing a weakness in the overall defense of my position This is how an army build around siege units has to play when they are terran When I miss micro, I lose many marines to the splash of his lurkers. By contrast, look at my opponent Unburrow, a move, control click, burrow This simple micro, it's even easier than lips, and let's face it, holding rapid fire and waving my mouse around isn't exactly difficult, forces me to back off and reassess if he times it anywhere in the ballpark of correctly Even when he does suicide almost his whole army, the lurkers still achieve a pyric victory of a kind by decimating my infantry My coaches say just mass lip with range or just make ghost law. And while these are to an extent valid, I feel that the amount of value lurkers get for their extreme ease of use makes them an imbalance unit, that while not necessarily overpowered, tamed the dynamic of an otherwise fun-to-play match-up If my opponent wiped my army with good brain control and splits, I can't respect it If my opponent runs a massive Zirk force into a siege line, loses everything, but yet still somehow isn't knocked out of the game despite losing pricey siege units, I feel more irritated. But if my opponent has an easier to use and hard as the counter-seach tank that doesn't deal friendly splash damage and is far more forgiving with its positioning, then, and only then, I truly feel like the lurker isn't balanced correctly This guy goes on for about four more paragraphs, but I think we pretty much get the gist of this He knows fancy words, and he's not happy with the lurker whatsoever So, with all of that in the back of her head, let's just hop into the game here because, holy crap, he, uh, this guy has a vocabulary that I'm kind of jealous of, I'm not going to like, with, pyrrhic? I didn't even know there were words with a why that weren't yogurt. He's just using them in a sentence It's absolutely unbelievable So, all right, we're into the game Missed in the bottom left as our Zirk player and Wayfarer as our fancy top hat-wearing, monocle-using Terran player who struggles with the Lurker Now, he actually raises a fair point, I think And this is something that people often forget when they talk about balance And it is something that I like to focus on It is the ease of use of certain units And he mentions the Carrier, High Templar specifically And I kind of agree with that. I think Carrier High Templar tends to be easier to use in the Protos versus Zerk matchup than whatever it is that the Zerk needs to do, in order to defeat that And does that make it imbalanced? Not necessarily imbalance, but it makes the game extremely frustrating Now, the Lurker is a similar unit in this matchup that when the Lurker first comes out, Taryn has a difficult time dealing with it, if they don't have sufficient siege tanks, if they don't have liberators, if they don't have any ghost whatsoever It can often feel like it's just an auto-lose the moment Zirk kind of takes control of the game. And I really do sympathize with that feeling that Wayfarer has over here, it can feel that way if you don't have enough ghost or if you don't have tanks or if you don't have map control Like, kind of three, four things that you need to have as a Terran in this situation to make the game somewhat more playable Because it is a shift in power in the TVZ matchup that isn't seen with any other unit With any other tech transition, there's never such a switch on power That really makes the Lurker unique. Is that necessarily a bad thing? Is it necessarily Imba? No, there are certain units in other matchups as well that can kind of cause a massive power shift or a massive power spike But with the lurker, because of how Zerg works, you can build so many at once that at times it just feels kind of silly Where as a Terran, you are completely in control of the game for the first, well, 12, 13 minutes And then 10 lurkers come out all at once and the power balance completely 180s and you very often just die immediately This is extremely frustrating and this can feel very Imba And maybe there is something here Maybe Wayfarer is onto something. Now, we'll do note that this is, of course, a diamond player, a tournament diamond player, by the way This was played in a tournament, as he mentioned And he actually opens up with some pretty cool stuff We saw him, I think he had an SEV over here that might have just died Yeah Trying to block the third base, so a Reaper on the, on one of the third and then the SUV on the other So he tried his best to block the base He's getting a standard triple-c-o-c-opener Like, this is, this is a really good build order, a very standard build order Gets the starport as. Gets a bunker accidentally, then follows it up with a star port, not entirely correct, but very close to correct Gets the starport before the as well, has a fast second gas Like, he knows his build order very well This much is obvious to me He's worse pro games He, you know, he can definitely, he can copy a build, is what I'm trying to say Okay, like this actually makes sense It makes me happy to see Like, he isn't all tall He's not the, you know, he doesn't just throw around a bunch of fancy words that I don't understand to make me feel inferior and then play like some four bunker opener at his own natural while forgetting his command center. Now, like he's swapping the tech lab with the start port, his thing finishes, he starts into an orbital immediately This actually looks pretty good Now, Helions, once Helion 3 and 4 are out, most likely want to be going across the map The reason why he's keeping these first two Helions at home right now is because he lost the Reaper And if you lose the Reaper, you don't know where the links are In that case, if you move out with your first two Helions and there's like a link run by, you might end up losing a mule and a couple of SVVs in your natural, which is frustrating and quite frankly not very good Decides to follow this up with a cloak banshee. Most likely double cloak banshee and that will, that should be eight cars then as well Or six cars is also possible, of course, but most of the time it's eight cars Builds a reactor with this factory and then should build two barracks at the same time here Look at that This guy actually knows exactly what to do He has a very good build order, a very solid build order Now, I'm a little bit disappointed that he isn't using these helions whatsoever If you build Helions, this is a harassment unit It's a unit that gives you a map control, a unit that can deny creep It really doesn't serve much of a purpose into the midgame. So I am not quite sure why you would not be using it right now Like, it is better to lose them in the early game and try to deal some damage Well, that's not entirely true because you can still use them to deal with runbys but just getting six Helions early on in the game to deal with runbyes is not it He also isn't using the Benchy whatsoever, so he invests a CREPton in harassment units, not to use them whatsoever, and that is a little bit surprising and also quite bad. I understand that if you're not entirely sure how a build order works, that you don't want to, you know, you don't want to split your attention too much into the Helians and the Benchies, but Helium Benchie Arras is extremely important, Portland and is one of the big things in this matchup or just harass in general is one of the big things If you don't check the Zirk player with your Helions and your banshees, he's going to drone up to an ungodly amount of drones really quickly And no matter how well you're trading for the rest of the game, it's going to be impossible to actually win because your opponent will just have too much stuff. You need to keep the Zirk economy in check That is just a fact of the Taryn versus Zerk matchup You need to deal some damage you need to deny some creep and you need to force links out of your opponent Now, luckily this Zirk player is an honorable Zirk player and although you're not harassing whatsoever, he says, you know what, I'll build some links, I'll build some bainlings, we'll get 14 extra links out and even though you haven't done anything yet, it will cut into my work account by a little bit Now, these banshees are absolutely not being controlled here I mean, this is not harassment. You just, you just shift-click these across the map and lost two banshees to kill a single queen This is kind of ridiculous And I'd suggest that if you're not going to use any harassment units, you should not be building them It's pretty simple It's basically, this is like buying a car without having a driver's license and not having any plans on getting a driver's license or driving the car It just doesn't make a lot of sense You invest a lot into this It delays your barracks marine production, it delays your first MataVec move out, and all you do is you just shift-click it across the map. It actually makes, that's like, that's like buying a card to use it as a target for water balloon practice Like, you can have very many other targets that are way better at that job You could have just opened up with a faster second directs from Triple Cc It probably adds a little bit of safety You should get a lot of Marines in the early games, well, no Benji, so maybe slightly less safe On top of that, I'd also like to note here for a second that you're starting your 2-2, before you are starting your combat shield, your first two METAX finish at the 8-minute mark. So although I was complimenting you in the early game here for your build order, these two Menev with a cloak Benchie, 8 Helion build order, are supposed to finish usually, well, 6 45, and they're pretty late already in that case at a high level. you're finishing them an entire minute later than that for no real reason at least that I can figure out it yeah I don't really see why on top of that you also only have 56 workers while your opponent has 86 you've done no damage whatsoever you don't even know if your opponent has a third base you have no scouting he's on five bases you're you're barely aware of the fact that he has a third like you're not sure if this is a fourth or a third base you have absolutely no clue you don't know whether he's a layer you have Zero info This guy is a dark enjoyer, by the way Double macro hatch in the main Huge fan of that. Hydralist Dan already being thrown down Like, this fella gets to make, the switch into 8 gas, into Hydra Dan, and eventually into Lurkers At the 8 minute mark, off of 91 workers Like, Serral is watching this and he's getting jealous He's like, holy crap, this guy is the fastest transition in the world And it's just purely because you have a number. moved out yet for the first eight and a half minutes in the game not with your heliants well you've moved out with your benches but rallied them into a queen um now finally you're moving across the map you kind of pre-stim your entire army half of your reinforcements get picked off well actually all of your reinforcements get picked off you stint with did you just stim three times already how did this happen okay so we have one stim already being used here I guess it's just a second stem that you use immediately Very unfortunate Well, if there's any banlings that connect right now with your marines, they're just going to get one shot because you don't have combat shield. And luckily for you, that's actually not quite what's happening because there's not that many banlings, but Hydras will still be capable of taking you out anyway. You take out a base and this is one of the things where a Terran would probably look at this fight and think to himself well resources lost pretty close you know about even I killed the base I killed 10 workers denied a bunch of creep and he writes in his little notebook you know that he has with his monocle and he stop and he goes like oh frantasma what's a better word for a marvelous trade it's like oh great marvelous and then put his little notebook down again it's like this wasn't actually a good trade you're still down 30 workers your opponent could potentially already be going into Hive you don't have a fort base yet there's no second factory and you're building a Thor now the Thor is the one unit you do not want to be getting against Zerk unless there are mutalis or a crepton of brute lords and it's late game and you can play Thor ghost or something like that but this is this is not a unit that you want against Ling Bain or Hydra link bain or Hydra Lurker or against roaches or against Lingbane ravager or against pure links or against pure banling. Maybe you want it if your opponent is an idiot and plays mass corrupter, but in that case I still think Marines probably would be better It's just a terrible unit that you don't really need against a lot of compositions Because it is slow, it doesn't have a, like, it doesn't outrange like a tank does Tanks are the solution to hydrolysk armies and especially knowing that a lurker then could be on the way Yeah, I would suggest getting more tanks, over getting a Thor I'm also really surprised, by the way, because when you wrote this entire post out, like you kind of tricked me, I feel like I really do believe that I got tricked there. The way that you wrote made me believe that you played a practically perfect game and that the only reason that you lost was the lurker You know, you use all these fancy words to say things that I didn't quite understand But now I'm watching this, you're getting like seven barracks off of three base There's no fourth base nine minutes into the game And you're building a Thor and you're going into Liberators, although you only have three MataVex at this point It kind of feels like I've been tricked. It's like you show up to like a dinner party with your top hat and your monocle and you sit there the chair and the waiter comes to your table and ask you, sure, what would you like for an appetizer? and you go, oh no, I don't require an appetizer I'll be eating from my nose tonight and you just start spooning the boogers from your nose and eating them And everyone at that table feels like they've been tricked by your appearance And I feel like I've been tricked by your high-level vocabulary and your fancy words I'm not a fan of it Like, you're still on 57 workers You're way down in the economy And you still don't have Combat Shield either. just, like, this is nowhere near close, a perfect game And you could have seen this as well, I think Like, I think your analysis on why the Lurker is an annoying unit to play against, so far has been spot on But you're not, you're not really facing any of these issues It's not like you've been playing with map control It's not like you've been multitasking You have not been tasking at all, like not single tasking, not multitasking Half of the time in this game, I've been wondering whether you're actually tapped into the correct screen or if you're browsing YouTube videos It's like it is difficult to see because literally nothing is happening. You're sitting at home with your with your crap army with your wank eco I start building marauders I do kind of like that most of the time Start moving towards the left side Okay So a bit of a rotation It's obvious that these three metaphics cannot support an army this size, especially with your willingness to stim your entire army for no real reason really quickly Like you're very trigger happy with those stims Just to get into position quicker Just to die faster, it is your second stim already, literally getting one shot by Danix right now It is absolutely insane to me that you're winning some of these fights, by the way. Because it's not like you've been micron very much or like winning or at least it looks like you're winning some of these fights Like you haven't been micron too much You're over stimmed You still don't have combat shield Upgrades are slightly in your favor It comes to third stimp No scan available anymore Now this is of course an issue because you're completely lacking eco So if you don't have extra orbital commands, this is another one of the things, which actually is frustrating to play against Lerker's with is if you don't have enough scans, you can't see them and they'll kill you Look at the big stims here You just stimp, by the way Like I I do not win. to be you know annoying or mean but you haven't really microed your army whatsoever so far you stimmed and if a fight doesn't look good you try to move back out of the fight but there's no splits there's no concave forming like all of this is just kind of moving into it um without forming concave for doing any of the moves that terence usually do like there's no moving back either you do siege up your units quite quite nicely you know yes good with the leapfrogging There comes a tank forward There's a good scan as well I like that That's for sure You can move these tanks forward once again as well This lurker's going to die. You have a big army sitting at home He's going to join up as well Still, only 61 workers You're being completely outmined by your opponent So although it feels like you're doing a great job here And although it feels like, oh, look at you denying a base You're denying someone's like, what is this? This seventh base or so Like, he literally has six bases if you take this base out of the equation You're still on three bases You're undersaturated at your third, the only mining base that still has enough mineral patches, and you're oversaturated in your main and you're natural He flanks you This is the fight that you describe, I think, the 13-minute fight. So I kind of want to see that again because I missed the start of it Here the Zerk moves in It kind of flanks this Don't forget you still don't have combat shield Your army is completely in the red Yet you win this fight, obviously because the Zerk engaged in a weird angle, did not really burrow his lurkers But even though he lost this fight and he's down 7K in resources lost, by the way, 7K down in resources lost, you're still down 50 supply He's a way bigger bank The only thing he's truly lacking at this point is a guess And the funny thing is that so far the lurker hasn't been an issue at all for you. In the early game, the first trade you did was 4 2K against 4 2K resources lost And now you actually are trading a lot better ever since the lurker got introduced You've been getting good trades The lurker is not your issue Your issue is that you don't have any eco yourself whatsoever The issue is that you're not denying his eco whatsoever This guy's been on 100 workers for the past five minutes and you're surprised that he has a lot of crap It's like, yeah, of course he has a lot of crap this guy's been mining non-stop Like absolutely non-stop Now, once again, you're just going to pick up these Hydralisks. This Zirk player, actually his control of the units has not been so great so far Like the flanks, the attacks, the micro back and forth It just hasn't been brilliant And you could be, you know, kind of using that for yourself and by expanding very fast and, you know, letting him attack into you maybe at some point as well, while increasing your eco But I'd rather you have this massive overstimped armies That is definitely a mistake You really stim a bit too much I think it's one of the big issues here If you would have gone back, I wonder if you just would have been able to win the game if you had like two more metaphacks waiting at home or so. Still no combat shield by the way, 14 minutes into the game Mr Monocle and Top Hat is absolutely unbelievable Fort base gets built At the 14 minute mark, Taryn gets like his seventh orbital command center It's in actual fact I've seen it happen I've seen it happen, especially against Lurker's Like you just need orbital commands And this year, this is way too late Now you finally did start saturating this Oh, just now, actually I think this base landed at like the eight minute mark or so, the seven minute mark, has been undersaturated for the past six minutes Too busy not building combat shield and overstimbing the army to notice, I guess more hatcheries as well coming up for the zirk. Like this zirc is actually macroing quite well And the funny thing is, and one of the cool things, I often mention this, is when people kind of realize that they're not perfect or they understand that they're not perfect And they add like extra macro hatcheries just so they always have enough larva And as a result, the zirc has been perfectly capable of spending his own money, kind of knowing, hey, I'm not perfect at this I'm going to lose a lot of army because my micro isn't brilliant and I'm incapable of spanning on my army because I'm not great at injecting either He kind of realizes what his weaknesses are and kind of plays around this I really think that is cool. Once again, you're going to kind of This guy just always comes from behind, by the way, off creep as well, super consistently Still no combat shield in this army You do have it on the way finally You get absolutely blasted here once again You are aware right now that there's at least one base on this far right side And now you also see that there's another base here At this point you should be realizing that you're probably very far down economically and that there's not going to be much of a way to get back into the game Send out the Liberator I kind of like it, a little bit of harassment I wouldn't mind a couple of extra meta facts as well. You're floating 2,900 gas How is it even possible? That's kind of wild, huh? That actually is kind of wild 2,900 gas No Ghost Academy yet But you are getting siege tanks, two at a time, which is good I even like one or two liberators, but the main issue is just the complete lack of meta-vex in your army But where's the liberator going against? Here Seed-stop, dealing some damage This guy's coming in You're not really, well, you don't have any defenses whatsoever, so you're just straight up kind of going to die, I guess, because you don't have enough crap Yeah I think this, this is the first time. where what you described actually kind of happens, where the Terran isn't completely ready for the lurkers, and as a result, you just kind of sit there, have to lift your base, you lose 18 workers, and you pretty much lose the game But, I mean, the reason why you don't have anything is not because of the lurker The reason you don't have anything is because you lost your entire army on the left side, and you lost your entire army on the right side, you haven't been building enough siege units, and you have crap eco. like there is a very different issues kind of leading up to this problem he gets six more lurkers I mean he still has plenty of money overall units lost by the way you're still up 5k so despite your pretty terrible trades on the right side and over here you're still doing somewhat okay once again completely over stimming your army or at least stimming everything at once for no real reason with a single matter of fact you're going to stim most likely again to run to this base or something like that or once you get there, you'll stim again And Bainlings will be able to do one shot to, yep, here we go. Bainlings will be rolling in and we'll be able to kill you at once This is a real issue You're completely dead as well And I think this is the weird thing, is that Terrans often don't realize when they're completely dead And that really is the case Like, this game is not close whatsoever This was not a close game From start to finish, you were dead He had 100 workers at the 9 minute mark or the 8 minute mark You have 54 workers at that point It was like triple out mining you Yeah, Gigi gets caught He also GGs You lose the game. Now, if we actually end here with the resources lost, we can see that despite you having lost your complete army and him still having an army, he is down in resources lost But he still has what is this? is like 8K resource bank, more, 8 3K resources in the bank You have absolutely nothing in the bank You have no money The issue here wasn't the lurker I do not understand how you can't see this You're completely misjudging this game The issue is that you did no damage whatsoever with your Helions in the early You did nothing with your Benji's You did not keep the Zerk eco in check at once Your initial pushout was way too late at the 8 minute mark. When you did end up pushing, the fight did not go too well Like, you lost your entire army while he stayed on a very high work account Your fort base was too late Your second factory was way too late You never got combat shield until the 14 minute mark Like the major fights were decided without combat shield Honestly, your fights against lurkers were probably the best thing in this game The fact that he didn't just mass banlings was really helpful to you because every single time you're about to engage into a fight You stim your army five times and because you only have two metaphacks, it means that banlings always one-shot your army The problem for you isn't the lurker. The problem for you is more the banling And the problem is that you don't attack your opponent whatsoever or harass your opponent whatsoever And you're kind of expecting everyone to stay on 50 workers so you can out-macro them But that's not how it works If your opponent gets more workers than you, more bases, and has a lot of crap, like even if your fights are going quite well, you're not going to to be winning It really feels like this entire essay that you wrote because it was darn long has nothing to do with this game. I remember, you know, sometimes you have these little toys as a kid where you need to put the, like the shape in the correct hole where it fits So you have like a circle shape and then you put it in the in the circle thing and you have like a little triangle and you put it in the triangle And if I were to have to do that, you know, if I were to have to do this with imbalance complaint forms and replays, this would be an impossible task You're that the triangle shape imbalance complaint form here does not fit in the replay I'd be the little idiot kit with, you know, hammering the round shape into the triangle. It doesn't fit! It's like, it just doesn't work And nothing that you've described actually happened this game, I feel like It was a nice essay and I'll give you some style points for that but it's just not true Like, it just didn't happen And I can say, oh, like, the Lurker is very frustrating to play against I understand this And many Terrans will have many replays where this shows, but this wasn't the replay Your replay did not show you losing to the Lurker Your replay showed you losing to a guy with a lot more money And, well, that's just life So, yeah, the Lurker isn't in bad my friend You just suck And that's the cold hard truth The cold heart truth. All right Thanks all for watching I hope you enjoyed this episode of I-e-e-o-this If you did, don't forget, hit the like button, subscribe to the channel And I'll see all of you next time for a new video Thank you and bye-bye."

        "text": "Dear Harstam, Zirc is just too overpowered in plat and above It requires an ostrich brain to play it and somehow reach GM with insane scouting ability Maphacks, a hundred army supply in a second, question mark, question mark, question mark As a Protos, I can't even play a macro game with Zerk, or I will lose badly In almost all my Zirk players I play against is either I go cheese or all-ins, no macro as lurkers, breed lords and ultra-lurts, Breed Lords and Ultralinks are just too overpowered This replay show that even, without a good Zirk comp, can beat Protos with ease Roach slash Hydra slash Viper isn't good at all, but somehow won, question mark, question mark. Against CIA with Kolo and Disruptors, what? Harsdom Admit it Zirk is just O P Even if I don't play perfect, the Zerk swarm is equivalent to the Zerk negative IQ left, minus 1 5 billion IQ Please tell me, Papa Harstam, God of Protos Is it just Inva, or do I suck? Name Kenosha, Race Protos, League Platinum, 3K MMR, and the server is North America One hell of an imbalance complaint for him I'm not even quite sure what I read, but I think he complained about Roach Hydra Viper and about Lurker and the Insane Scouting ability, which is practically MapHak So I'm looking forward to this one And here we have our subject of today. Ken No Suwa, a protos player from North America with 3K MMR That's the What is this? Like a black hole or like a moon or something But what do you call it when the sun is behind the moon? There's a word for it in Dutch, but I don't know this in English This happens like every couple of years And then people take pictures of it in reality, it kind of looks like this, actually I think that's what it is In the bottom right, we have purple goose, our Zerk player, who actually has the decal of a purple goose. At first, I want to say, that looks a lot like an ostrich, but it probably is a goose, and it's purple, and his name is purple goose, and the color he plays with is purple as well So this guy is what we call a concept player, you know? He has a concept and he really sticks with it, no matter whether it's cool or not Also goes for a drone scout, which is somewhat surprising Dron scouts are considered to not ever really be worth it, kind of a bad thing to do As a Protos, you can just, well, kind of ignore it It doesn't matter Zyr can get all the info that they want to be getting with their overlord anyway. The only thing you need to do is you need to pull two workers to make sure that they can throw down a hatchery on your base and so that you can get your own nexus in time Oh, gets blocked Yeah, this is why you pull two workers, so you can attack it You can just get a core first as well and then attack this and you should still be fine Throw it down on the I like this a lot You know, this is really cool Throwing down the natural on the third base if you get blocked by a drone This is like showing up to the grocery store, but the grocery store is closed. And then as a result, it's like, what's the correct decision here? You cut off your own leg and you eat that instead It's like, I'm not quite sure if that is the best thing to do Like you could have also just waited for the next day You wouldn't have died overnight And it's the same here You wouldn't have died building your nexus three seconds later Now instead you have your nexus on the third base location, which means it's going to be really vulnerable for any type of Ling attacks It also means that the probes that your rally over there are going to take a very long time to get to that pace And thus you'll lose some mining time. It would have been way better just to build it in this location So this is genuinely quite a bad start Now, I'm glad you rallied your gateway Sometimes what I see is when people don't rally their gateway and it's in this position, your adept gets stuck over here, which is really unfortunate And I'm happy to see that you did not do that Now, the purple goose after blocking, hello? Why would you shade away? This is your job, adapt This is like the security guard at the museum The moment things get a little bit, you know, a little bit spicy There's like 350-year-olds that have a discount card. and you don't want to deal with it, the security guard just walks away unless the pylon gets taken out, because of course if you have a pylon at the museum, I would have much preferred if that adept would have stayed at home to defend that pylon, because that's actually just entirely the job of the adaptive If links show up on your side of the map, you take them out with your adept Now, instead, what you ended up doing is I think you send it into the main base and you killed one drone with it I think the other drone that you killed was the scouting drone, but I could be wrong on that You have no real tech whatsoever either. You start getting your Stargate right now Now this Stargate got thrown down at three minutes and 35 seconds The standard timing for a Stargate to go down with a Gateway Scout is two minutes and 21 seconds That means that for no view of reason, you are more than 70 seconds late with your Stargate And that is honestly kind of painful I do not like that it just means that your opponent can delay spores forever It means you won't be dealing any damage Also means that you won't have any scouting information, which is kind of important in this matchup Your wall in your natural is also a work of art in that it serves no real purpose. The gateway over here, I am not sure why we're getting it in this exact location You could create a bit of a wall with it over here It's not great so far But you know what? Work account is pretty equal Your Zirk opponent also isn't perfect He's floating money You're doing okayish You know, we're still in decent shape It's not like this game is over Sure, the early game wasn't tight Sure, if our opponent would have linked flooded, we would have absolutely lost this game 100% No doubt about it But it didn't happen And we can't always think about hypotheticals Like we're living in the real world And this had no bad consequences and thus it wasn't too bad for you. You're not chrono boosting, your necksi for some reason I do this like that a lot because it means you're going to fall behind even further in the work account This Oracle is going to go across the map I was afraid you would use it to kill this Overlord I think it's the correct call to just straight away send this Oracle across the map You get double robo in your main base and then a gateway added at your third Stopping worker production Now this is not a build that I'm familiar with so I can't really comment on it I just don't know what the exact purpose of this is. But as always, I have a mind that wants to learn more, you know, rather than being judgy immediately I'm like, okay, I want to see what this is going to be Because double Robo, you probably want to get a lot of Immortals out, maybe Observers You want to get a lot of vision on the map Warp Prisms Like, these are the things that I'm thinking about immediately, you know you want to be using that And you actually are using it This is cool. Because very often what happens at lower levels is that I see people throw down like four robos, three stargates, and then they build one voyter and like, all right, let's call it quits, they'll warp in seven zealots, attack across the map and still win the game, of course But I'm glad to see that's not the case You're actually building your production structures and you're using them And in that case, I don't really mind it Although this is very non-standard It is an extremely rare strategy Your entire build order has been kind of weird All of your moves so far have been kind of odd But at least you're using the things that you're building. So in your little niche of build orders that don't make any sense and don't seem very good, at least you build an observer and immortal Now, of course, you start idling them after I've been praising you for almost 25 seconds straight And that is what you get for being an idiot like me and praising people for things that aren't very good So yeah, in reality, I don't actually like the double robos But if you would have used them continuously, I at least would have understood it Like if you're Imagine that your goal is to build eight immortals In that case, getting two robotic facilities is probably the correct way to achieve that goal. The question might just be is getting eight immortals a goal that you really want to achieve in the PVZ matchup, at least this quickly I don't think so But the way you're going about reaching your goal is probably correct with the Robo But it seems like that wasn't your goal either And this is always something that you kind of want to keep in mind when you're throwing down production in general It's like, hey, what unit composition am I working towards? Like, how flexible do I want to be in that unit composition? Because if your initial plan, let's just catch another scenario here Imagine your initial plan is to get those eight immortals out. and in order to reach that goal, you throw down three robotics facilities Then you scout a spire and like, wait, against spire, I want, you know, anti-air So you throw down three stargates yourself Now, this is not a very flexible build order because you can't react within the production that you already have, which is why often when we see the top Protos players play, they get a lot of gateways, they get a single robot and they get a single star gate, and if a Twilight and a Forge, It leaves you with a lot of flexibility to within the production that you already have, respond to a lot of different types of plays from the opponent. With your setup, it is kind of difficult to properly respond to something like a spire You can't maybe get some phoenixes out, but getting any type of gateway presence will be really difficult because you just don't have enough gateways So getting arcons, a lot of charge lots, one or two sentries out would just be very difficult There's always something to keep in mind when you are building production like, hey, what is my goal? So, yeah, I do like that you're thinking about stuff Sometimes you see people just kind of blindly copying pros You're thinking like, hey, what is my goal? But yeah, just do know that there's a reason why pros do it the way that they do it. This guy builds buildings like he's an AI, by the way What's how with that? You see that? The AI usually has like a roach warrant and a bailing nest an EVO chamber on top of one another It looks kind of silly I don't know why I know it doesn't really matter, like whether he builds it over here, over here It just looks too proper And then what actually pisses me off is that this Evo is one spot off because the infestation pit isn't bigger than Hydrodite, so you just misplaced it If you're going to make a nice little square out of four buildings, at least do it correctly, this is actually making me upset. I just realized, by the way, this guy also is in a clan called P-Goose So he literally is the purple goose, the pea goose, the purple goose And he's playing purple zirk He's really cool I can forgive this Evocham mistake now All right Back into the game, what is it that you're actually getting? So you scouted an infestation pit, no hydra then Your response was to get Colossi, more immortals, a fort base as well I kind of like that you're trying to wall here That's cool stuff You haven't once moved on the map to try and deny creep, which is starting to bite you in the bomb a little bit. as our boy purple goose and does not only like purple goose but also likes the purple creep and he's spreading it all across the map now you might be wondering why isn't he spending it spreading it towards the far left side here it's because creep doesn't spread here on the latter map the map is actually bugged fun fact well it's not a fun fact actually it's a sad fact this bug has been in the game for the past year that's not been fixed look it is no creep whatsoever beautiful stuff all right Right, first Colossi are being popped out right now And your army comp against what your opponent has is actually kind of okay. Getting Immortals, getting a Colossi out against a very big Roach Hydra army Yeah, it's not how I would do it, but it's probably going to do the job just fine The only thing you need to be afraid of right now is either the follow-up of Lurkers or the follow-up of Vipers And maybe in some scenarios, I could see like a corruptor Roach Hydra, very old-school Not really common anymore, but it could still be a little bit dangerous if the Zerk is up in supply It's going to be five vipers rather than anything else, rather than corruptors or lurkers So in that case, you want to be countering those vipers already. And as you have even scouted, I believe, that there's a hive on the way Yep, you should actually already be getting a Templar archives at this point You have plenty of gas available And if you would just get like, oh, you already have a Temple Archives So yeah, you just warp in three, four, Templar Perfect Absolutely perfect stuff It's important that you do not morph these into arcons, though The use of the archon here is way less than the use of the Templar So the Templar will feedback your opponent If you research Storm, it can storm as well Storm always is better than having an archon. And having one of your colossire mortal stay alive is also more important than having one Archon deal a little bit of damage against a Roach or a Hyder army Now this wouldn't be necessarily true if your opponent has an army that consists solely of Ling Bain, then having Archons in there actually is quite useful, but against Roach Hydra, Arcons don't actually do too much, so you can kind of skip them Getting disruptors as well right now to add a little bit of splash in your army You still haven't moved out once, by the way, which is somewhat impressive And the timing you do decide to move out, this Rambi gets in That is extremely unfortunate. You just ignore the run by? Oh no, he just sends it back Look at this He's microing a run by at platinum level I actually can't believe what I'm seeing Okay, five vipers are out Now, this should be an issue for you, but at the same time, your army is so big that despite the lack of Templar, you might still be okay It's just going to cost you a couple of units for free So this should never have happened You lose three colossi for basically free You still have a lot of immortals, which means that this fight still looks somewhat okay bay One Coloss actually stays alive as well Arcons Half your army just chasing Arcons. The other half of your army is killing drones over here I feel like you did not really micro this and as a result you kill and the drones and this base and also his army So I feel like by not microing you actually did better than you would have done if you would have microed So I like it This fight gets a thumbs up from me This is an approved fight. actually win this fight you're up 20 workers and this game looks pretty over yeah you have 1600 minerals in the bank you're on four bases the roach romeby did not deal too much damage I thought I just saw a couple of Templar march across the map what happened with those I want to see those again yeah I wasn't crazy do you have storm yet okay no storm oh you morph them into Arcons okay no that's completely fine I was afraid you walk them into like 10 roaches, but instead you just morph them into arcons And in this case, I actually think that's a, that's a decent call Right now, there is a really cool concept, actually, which is called retreating. And this sounds kind of wild I understand that because you have a big army and you like pressing that A button to A move across the map But if we were to evaluate the situation right now, the only way that you can truly lose is, you know, you can truly lose, is to the instant remax of the Zerk You know that the Zerk had complete map control, had a lot of eco, or at least a decent amount of eco during the entire game You know that he had a hatchery in the main base No, he was at least on like four or five bases, and there's still four hatcheries remaining that can reproduce units pretty quickly. Knowing that you have a bank, you probably know that your opponent also had a bank He just killed two bases and had a very, very, very advantageous fight for yourself The one way you can lose is against the remix So what you do instead is you just walk back, check what your opponent remaxes on, knowing that your opponent does not have the eco to switch into a different unit comp You then counter that unit composition with your superior eco, and then you push out again But in order to do that, you need to retreat I am afraid that what you're going to be doing here is you will walk into this and then Actually, you'll just kill him anyway It probably doesn't matter. I still would prefer I think you should almost always move back If you kill this many bases and you did not lose any eco yourself, there's no reason to attack into someone for this blood hour Okay, well, here, if you're going to attack, at least use everything There's like two disruptors sitting in this prism, a couple of zealots as well These archons were idling This colossi is attacking the hatchery Interesting fight this was Very, very interesting find And I'm losing the disruptor as well Verbedwoopiud Very nice The best part is that you're still really far ahead and that the Zerk probably realizes that as well Like the Zerk knows that he's completely dead Like he's looking at, wait, this guy's a complete idiot. Like he looks at his drone counts Like I have like 40 drones I know my opponent is on four bases this, all he is left is like 10 hydras, 13 hydras and a roach Vipers don't actually deal damage That's the entire damage output here You start tacking into Storm, get too colossi out, still have five immortals Like, you're winning really, really hard The reason why you don't think you are winning is probably because there's so much creep on the map It feels scary, but this game is actually completely freaking over right now Like, super over The only thing you need to do is clear a little bit of creep Take a fifth base, take the watchtowers. Let's not forget that you haven't had map vision at any point during the game I love where this observer is positioned, by the way You have a unit that is invisible You can spot anything, anywhere, anytime And you decide to put it in the dead space where you can see whether he's researching adrenal glands or not Although I do doubt whether you know that, for the people who don't know, of course, is that if the pool is researching something, it starts moving a little bit like this like the wavy grass in SpongeBob when he goes jellyfishing So you just got to pay attention to that And that's what this observer is for. Oh, actually gets F2 back home or gets just sent back home, one of the two Wouldn't surprise me if that wasn't F2 Try taking a fifth base as well here, but the creep obviously managed to block that There's a lot of zealots There is Storm What is the upgrades? 2-1 upgrades against 3-3 Now, the upgrades are a little bit lacking in this case It's just also surprising because there's double forges Having 2-1 upgrades with double forges, that is actually very, very little Probably just completely forgot about it We're not going to focus too much on that Like it's bad, but Storm doesn't really care about upgrades. Immortals, well, they do care a little while upgrades, but it's also not the end of the world You get caught out of position a little bit This Roach Hydra attack just moves in You do manage to take it out This is really bad though So if you're trying to, once again, we kind of have to think of like what goal you're trying to achieve right now in this game But it feels to me that you just want to sit back and defend And in that case, in order to have a successful defense, you still need to try and get some map vision. So like a zeal it over here, a zeal it over here, maybe you have like an observer positioned over here, and put your army in between the two bases Or you could just build a lot of cannons on one one of the two bases, like two Templar there and ta-da, you also have a defense This is the weirdest run by I've seen in my life Five slow stalkers without blink and a zealot scouting this top right side base, and then going in here Watch them kill 12 workers If he actually gets 12 workers, I will give this the imbalance stamp If these five stalkers get 12 workers, it means that the Zerker is not paying attention. Okay, well, I did not want to give the Imba stamp yet But, so far he's making a pretty decent case for Zerg being imbalanced I mean, this guy is stuck on a Roach Hydra Viper army with 3-3 upgrades Again, such a sophisticated Protoss army I still don't actually see a way for this Protoss player to lose whatsoever Completely blind on the bottom side and start sending Zealots out This is actually a very good play Zealot runbys are a great tool at, A, keeping your opponent home, and be getting information So those are the two things that you want right now. I also kind of believe he should be considering attacking at some point I mean, he's practically maxed out. Your opponent isn't going to stay on Roach Hydra Viper forever, although he's on 36 workers, and that means that transitions will be difficult This is also kind of weird, no? Look at this So you know right now at this point, that the entire army, or practically the entire army is on the bottom side, what I would do in this case is I would start moving my entire main army towards the bottom, send like a zealot over here, maybe send three zealots over here Now, sadly there is roaches there, but of course you don't know that, and then you at least get that information that the roaches are there If the roaches aren't there, you can kill a lot of drones. That way you're a matching your opponent's army movement, you get some map vision and you do some harassment damage, which all three of these things are really, really good as a Protos player So that's what you want to be doing Instead, is you spotted this army Oh, you actually do start moving Are you just too late? Yeah, you're just too late Maybe you should have recalled Oh, you stopped moving Maybe you should have recalled, actually Send another zealot towards the watchtower after your army dies over here to see if he's going to attack you It would have been helpful Losing this base isn't the end of the world And it might actually, he might actually be doing you a favor. because right now in your proto's caveman brain we all have it you go like lost the base time to counterattack and you start the counterattack and of course that's exactly what's going to happen here it's beautiful this is why sometimes i believe that zirks should not kill bases if they cannot fight the counterattack and right now purple goose absolutely cannot fight the counterattack he has a single brute lord no he's oh wait he can fight a counterc he's nine brute lords that's a big rb right here you have nothing really prepared for this either, which is somewhat painful Yeah, this is an issue as well. I haven't really focused on it too much, but often when you do not scout and do not attack and do not transition into a different army, what can end up happening is that your opponent does transition into a different army and you will be unaware of that And in that case, what happens is you can end up with like a completely non-anti-air army, except for the storms and a couple of arcons against these brute lords And no matter how massive your army is, no matter how valuable your army is, you're just going to get absolutely blasted Or at least the broodlords are going to eventually stay alive and kind of destroy this army. It's really frustrating because you had a good army for a long time, which you could have used to attack or trade out or to get map control Another thing, by the way, that you could have done in this case, as you actually tap out I'm not even sure if there's a good army that was necessary I mean, you were still up 30 workers Another thing you could have done, which once again, this is kind of a revolutionary concept, but the moment you see that your army isn't the correct army to deal with your opponent's army, you could throw down like a storm over here, a storm over here, and actually just run back home. Like, what's he going to do, chase you? Like, there's no shot It's like, like, unless, yeah, it's just not possible Unless he has like fungles, does have a couple of abducts, so he might get like three or four units But him getting three or four units is better than you losing your entire army So at this point, you can just move back, run home, and it will be absolutely no issue Actually, what are these two Colossi going to do? I haven't paid enough attention to these Colossies I remember the first Colossi actually damaged this hatchery Still has the scars Now, this hatchery is also going to get it But actually, I end up falling as well Look at that Entire fight. I guess you literally just aim of every single fight which honestly majority of the time is okay, but if you're fighting an army that you can't fight, it's best to just move combat back home Then you should be fine Yeah, this is a very, very sad game It's actually a very, very sad game You're winning the entire time, despite you doing very little correct If I was the Zirk player, I would have sent this one in It's like how, how is it possible that I almost lost to this guy? I had an entire map covered in creepspread He built a pure colossus immortal army I don't think he even feedbacked any of my vipers during the entire game. Like, I played so much better, and yet he almost managed to beat me How did that happen? And I would have been kind of sympathetic towards that imbalance complaint form But this one is like you say insane scouting ability, map hacks, 100 army supply in a second Like, none of these things even really mattered Like the insane scouting ability and the map hacks is completely irrelevant because you always stay at your third and Fort Base, you never moved out You could have denied the creep and taken the watchtowers, but you didn't do that Him having vision of the entire map doesn't matter if you're not moving on the map The 100 army supply in a second. I guess one time he remixed on roaches and hydras, but there was more like 50 army supply in 25 seconds And you could have just gone back home and still been fine You can't play a macro game with Zerk or you will lose badly. I like this entire game just doesn't make sense to me you do nothing you have the correct army for a very long time then you attack into your opponent by the time your army isn't the correct army anymore and your opponent has brute lords you're consistently ahead in eco you have no map vision whatsoever like you actually did nothing correct yet you still play a very long macro game and you almost win and there's like practically practically 15 different points in the game where I could look at If you would do one thing different here, you would win. Like legit 15 things, like from retreating to having a better unit composition, from microing your army, you know, defending your bases in time, having map vision Just nothing Absolutely nothing was correct So I don't think with a good conscience, my friend, I can tell you that Zerk is imbalanced No, my friend It is you who sucks And you suck very, very hard All right That's going to be it for me today Thanks all so much for watching to this episode of Is It Inba or Do I Suck?

        "text": "83% win rate Dear Amiral, you can't stand as a captain all your life Battlecruiser, Mines, is Inba This Terran has 83% win rate in TVP, which is suspicious if it were balanced My early game was decent, then I forced it to retreat of his B3 Watching the replay, I'm quite sure it wasn't worth it However, I had time to make the composition I thought it was okay Hydra versus Mines and Corrupture versus BC Nope Sucks I was Wait Hydra versus Mines and Corruptor versus BC, yet he complains about his opponent's TVP win rate Either he doesn't quite understand what race he's playing himself No one told him that Protos is the alien race He believes that Hydra's and Corruptor are Protos units. And you know what? We'll leave him We'll leave him with this I'm not going to be the guy to tell him to ruin his build-off image of what Protos looks like Let's continue I was lacking gauze to make more, but I already had eight gauze I do know what to do Amiral, I know I sucks due to my MMR, but is it imba? Or do I sucks really hard? Name, suposaton, race, zirk, thick diamond, 3 4K MMR and the server is NA All right, we're here on Burlingrad in a TVZ, indeed So, although this Terran has apparently an 83% win rate in TVP, we are going to be watching a Zerg versus Terran in which mines and battle cruisers are way too powerful. And you know what? I already agree with this Mines and battles and battle cruis are a very powerful combination Mines kill everything on the ground and in the air and battle cruisers also kill everything on the ground in the air You put these two together and yet the type of synergy that you hardly ever see in life The only problem with this composition is that it's impossible to truly get into Staying alive without tanks is extremely difficult Staying and in general actually mass mines also isn't that good because you can't really attack into places that easily It might be great defensively or at least okay defensively. Once you get out like 30 or 40 mines and you have nine battle cruisers but attacking into positions is just extremely difficult because mines need to burrow and burrow all the time But we'll have to wait and see exactly what Fasada no Buxo, interesting name, is going to be playing over here It starts with a low ground barracks and no gas whatsoever So this is one of the build orders that I haven't seen before in my life Okay, well, it's like a gasless expanse with a low ground Well, I don't completely mind it, honestly If he wants to be going into fast battle cruisers, it might actually not even be that bad. At the same time, we have supose Satan, who was the star of today's episode, opening up with a hatchery first, a gas and a pool This overlord's going on a little trip behind his own mineral line, some sightseeing in your own backyard People don't know this, but very often in the area surrounding your house, like the five to ten kilometers around it, there's a lot of interesting things that you don't really appreciate And then once you move away, you kind of start missing those things, you know? Even in your own backyard. Did you know that if you spend an entire day looking at birds in your backyard, you probably have no life because who has time for that type of stuff? One of my friends once told me this He was like, Kevin, did you know if you spend an entire day looking for birds in your backyard that you might see more than 35 different bird species? And first of all, I don't have a backyard And second of all, why would I go look in my own backyard for 35 different bird species if I could just go online and look at thousands and thousands of bird species Like, the fact that the bird is landing in my backyard does not make the bird more special. I never quite understood that I'm terrible at sightseeing as well Whenever I go to some foreign country with my girlfriend, she would like, ah, we went to Rome, for example He's like, ah, let's go see the Coliseum And I just, I Google the pictures I'm like, well, I think I have a decent idea of what it's going to look like I can find a lot of information about the Colosseum on Wikipedia as well So, you know, I'm telling her this information, like all the things I know But then when we get there, she still wants to take a tour by some guide, pay money for that And I'm just not a great tourist, I guess. And also not a great tourist of the backyard But that is not really relevant to this game that we're watching here, which is a ZVT Four Queens opener so far a fast speed single drone in gas This builder actually looks pretty tight The only thing we're missing so far is a scout We're also getting a scout We'll see the double factory And we should see continued queen production at this point So you kind of want to be building a queen from this base and from this base, continue spreading creep with the new queen. So it's actually kind of easy the way that Zirk works is that whenever a queen pops from a hatchery, you inject once, you start a new queen from the natural on the third And then the queen that just did this first inject will join the other queens in creeping However, for some reason, suposatan is not actually building more queens And not building more queens is almost always a mistake in the early game The queen is a little bit the It's like baking soda in StarCraft 2, you know? If there's anything wrong in your house, 99% of the time baking soda will be part of the fix. whether that is a solo mission for the baking soda, or if there's some vinegar involved as well, it doesn't matter It's similar for Zirk with the queen If there is a problem that the Zerk has, especially in the first 10 to 12 minutes of the game, 99% of the time, this hole in your play can be patched by adding more queens initially into your game, especially if you're going to be floating 1K minerals. The interesting thing is that Zirk doesn't actually have enough larva in the early game to continuously be building, or to not start floating units, even if you have perfect injects, because drones just don't cost so much and they use up larva very quickly, which is why continuous queen production, first of all, it saves larva, because if you're building queens and your opponent attacks you with, let's say, Helions, you don't really need to build links or roaches against that However, if you don't have the queens, you need to cut your drones. So building queens is an economical play in every yeah in every single way it's just like I said the baking soda of Zerk for sure it fixes all of your problems trust me on that now if we're looking at the Terran he does have a third base already floating over and we see that Super Old Satan is going to go in for a bit of an Overseer Scout here I always do like a cheeky overseer scout allows you to see everything now he already is aware of the fact that there was a third CC he saw the double factory he saw the two armory, oh sorry, no, one eBay, one armory, and a fusion core also being built here. So, yeah, there's a lot of information It's kind of important that the overseer goes in, but even at this point, he should already know that most likely there's going to be battle cruisers, because almost every Mac opener in the world has battle cruisers It still would be nice to get that confirmation, though, especially, I guess he's going to wait for the numbing I'm not really cool, by the way, and I kind of want to talk about this I'll pause here for a second This hatchery, it looks stupid, but it actually is not stupid at all. If you're going to make a macro hatchery, I don't mind it being in this type of a position, because it means that the reinforcements are going to hit faster wherever you want them, whether it is in an attack or in a defense The only thing you need to be aware of is that you're not going to ruin your own unit movement so much that like a drop in a cheeky position would be able to deal more damage because of this hatchery But otherwise I actually really like this I like this even more than just straight up building it in the main base. I actually think this is one of the things that some of the top Zerg players don't do correctly and suposatain over here is doing it I don't think you can build like three hatcheries like that because it's going to interfere with your unit movement You probably don't want one next to your third base But here, in this type of area, yeah, I actually think it's quite good It cuts off four or five seconds of travel time This is a really cool move, Super Satan Now, what isn't a cool move is the Hydralisk Hydralisk are some of the worst units that the Zerg can make against Mech, at least in my mind. If you're going for hydras, you really need to rush out fast vipers, and you need to be continuously trading with Hydra Roach, Fiper, I guess This is not really a composition that we see a whole lot It really fell out of fashion like maybe three or four years ago We used to see some hydrabane against Mac, I think, back in the day But even that we don't see at all anymore, honestly. Nowadays, majority of the time, it's going to be a Roach, initial Roach defense into corruptors to deal with the battle cruisers and then, well, just for a very long time sticking with that Roach Ravitur, high drone count eventually going into investors and all types of other stuff bailings being added in as well to start blowing up planetary so yeah it's this is a very old school style but if you're rushing into vipers and you have a pretty decent early game which i think suposatan definitely had it might not even be that bad honestly i do start to worry a little bit because he's floating a fair amount of money and he's still not aware of the fact that there's right now two Star Ports producing battle cruisers. And although he has a hydra then, he's only built eight hydras for anti-air The queen count is very little, because apparently Supal Satan does not require any baking soda in his life The worker count on the fourth is a little bit low initially I believe we already could be a lot higher because nothing has really happened Let's not forget that so far, the only interaction that these players had is, what, two mines going down, two marines going down, four links and two hydras and overlord Like, practically nothing has died at this point, and there has been no pressure whatsoever on supos Satan either, who's right now building eight revengers without having any info whatsoever on what his opponent is doing. There is six Starport battle cruiser, and the best thing that he can come up with is to get nine revengers, 17 roaches Two more overseers as well, by the way I love that This OSIR still hasn't scouted anything Let's see the fifth base flying over Yeah, where initially I think the eco looked quite good for Super Satan right now, he probably needed to attack a long time ago And an attack would have required more hydras than what we currently have Because with just eight hydras against two battle cruisers, I have a feeling that just isn't going to be good enough So you're just going to be walking into some big trouble. This actually is probably one of the first things you're going to lose to if you're completely kneel to Starcraft is that you have units that don't shoot up but are ranged I remember when I first saw the roach, I thought this was the dumbest concept in the world I was like, man, this guy has a range attack, but he can't shoot up And it didn't work in my head whatsoever I just couldn't grasp it for some reason Absolutely pissed me off I'm not the smartest guy, but it really did piss me off Now, at this point, Super Satan sees the battle cruisers, knows that there's mines here as well I still think attacking into this might not actually be bad. Because you could maybe clear Could clear the mines and a bunch of workers He threw a couple of piles on his own face I kind of want to go back there in that moment That's pretty wild Look at this It almost feels like he's rapid firing these Biles as well It's the way he's thrown around This is the first as well Usually you see Xerks, they use their overlords to tank mine shots and try to fly them on top of the Terran Bio Army But suposatain has a different trick He uses the overlords to trick the widow mines into splash damaging on top of the roaches That's absolutely brilliant play. I've never seen something like this before, but I'm learning all types of new things over here Look at this A couple of Biles just throwing them down on himself for absolutely no reason whatsoever Not a single SUV is being attacked This refinery, however, is getting it This sensor tower is getting it as well Refinery getting it and now majority of the SUV still managed to escape Great fight So so far, Supo Satan has killed absolutely nothing Bar maybe like four or five workers and he took out a refinery as well as a sensor tower And he lost his entire ground force Literally every single ground, well, Not literally Almost literally, every single ground unit. He also said he had eight gas, but he's not really mining from eight gas He's not enough workers in this one Max is out on hydras It's an interesting call And the reason that's an interesting call is because he already has a spire about the finish up And I'd reckon you'd much rather get corruptors against this army than hydras. believe you're going to need something to deal with the mines at this point and reverters are actually kind of okay at that as well you can bile at mines and that will kill mines you can you you can outrange him as well with your ravager so the reverber corruptor composition would still work perfectly now the hydra link composition this is the the absolute sickest composition i'm not quite sure what these links are for cannon fodder maybe oh maybe it's like you know what it works so well with the Overlord earlier when I pulled my opponent's army, you know, when I put my opponent's widow mines on top of my roaches, this time I want to see if I can also do that with links. Maybe that's going to be the goal of these links I love this single Ravager in the army as well It's a very big play Some scouting links going in right now 35 widow mines Very interesting What if I can affect me to this? Huh? Yeah Did that? him the green light I love that so much He scouts six battle cruisers, 25 mines, in position He has, what does he have? It's like 15 hydras or so No, this is all the hydras, right? Now there's some hydros at home Okay, so there's like 15, 16 hydras, a ravager, and 30-ish links And he's like, yeah, this seems fine This is going to be the fight that I want to take right now. It's a brilliant play Mine start burrowing FOOP! Ha ha ha ha ha ha Why do you scout if you don't understand what you're seeing? Absolutely no shot This is like a guy that can't read going up to a sign and pretending like he understands what says Like, hmm, right, right, right, so It's like, it doesn't work, mate If you can't read, don't go towards a sign and pretend that you can It's the same here Don't scout if you don't know what to do with the information anyway Give up If you want to attack, don't pretend that you're waiting for the scout to confirm it You know, just attack Just go for it I don't care No one's going to judge you. We're playing in the Platinum League So good I like that he remixed on links as well After that less successful fight where he killed half a widow mine, he decided that building 50 more links was going to be the correct answer here Yes, I'm a high-level thinking More mines moving in right now And now you're actually in a pretty tricky situation, funnily enough, in which you don't have anything to deal with the mines You finally do have your corruptors I should have checked this earlier Oh boy 14K resources lost against 4 2K I think this has to be one of the sickest ratios that I've ever seen I can't actually remember more than three and a half times. That is really difficult even with Zerk This guy is extremely efficient Holy crap It actually is very, very impressive Now, these mines are continuing to move in At this point, I really do believe that the position is quite bad for Super Satan He still should just not be building links, though I like getting some spines as a defensive measure against these mines I even would have preferred getting a couple of ravagers here that would have been absolutely fantastic At the same time, he did manage to kill the fifth base, and he's mining, well, he could be mining from some of these bases as well He has 20 larva and 3,500 minerals. And I've seen this before, actually, from ZERC players at the lower level And it's one of the things that I actually do not quite understand So one of the most difficult things with Zerk is spreading creep and injecting like the macro mechanics of Zerk are actually quite difficult to use And often what I see in these lower level games is that Zirks at least inject or they have plenty of larva, but then they don't just use them And spanning larva is actually the easiest macro mechanic in the entire game because you have all hatcheries on a single control group, you press the S button for select larva, and you just build whatever you want like 25 at a time. So he could just immediately redrone up into these bases, get up the 10 gas and probably still be capable of playing a game here Let's not forget his opponent is on a pure, well, 10 battle cruisers is a lot though Even if you're going to get a lot of these corruptors At this point, I think you need to Yeah, I think you're forced to get into some type of wind faster A for the fungal, so they can teleport away, and B for the neural parasites So you can use some of your opponents, Yamato cannons on themselves You can maybe use a teleport as well, and you know, just for some extra tanking power. Having five battle cruisers fighting on your side is always good, of course So, yeah, I really would have liked I think these 18 drones are a good call I wouldn't have minded seeing some inject, which we, by the way, haven't been seeing I said that he had a lot of larva, but all of these larva were literally just He had 21 larva, and I guess he has, what? Six hatches? Yeah, he has six hatches So he did a single inject A single inject, and now he's doing another single inject on all of his bases Yeah, the injects just haven't been too good Still, 12 larvae available and he's just not really spending it. 27 corruptors, the upgrades for the corruptors also really, really suck, despite him having two spires I guess he's getting one, one I'm not going to flame him for that I'll allow it I'll allow it It's completely fine A couple of hydras are being rebuilt here, probably to try and deal with the widow mines, not realizing that the ravagers would kind of fulfill that role in a better way Has he scouted anything? Yamata is crazy No? That's actually insane Who are that? Poof I feel like you should always keep vision in order for the Yamata to land Sick spell Absolutely crazy spell Yeah Corruptors anyway, corruptors moving in right now Some interesting snipes actually It might have worked if you would have continued. It was kind of scary, of course, there with that mine burrow Good to control, though, so far on the Vipers I also wouldn't have mined like a single, or sorry, on the Vipers on the corruptors I wouldn't have mined a viper here to just pull one or two of these battle cruisers into this army I think that would have been quite cool Now there's nothing absolutely There's absolutely nothing to deal with the mines So every fight is just going to be really, really scary You just need something to deal with the mines Even if it's just some ravagers, some fungles, all of it would just be kind of a okay And now this fight is just going to get absolutely blessed right. You have two-two upgrades Mines are still hitting as well on these corruptors There's still legit 15K resources in the bank for the Terran This Terran is actually this is a crazy unit's lost step Like even for a TVZ This is actually crazy Three times as March in a somewhat of a mid-the-late game Gigi gets called and the game ends Now, honestly, if I was a Zerk player and I would have played a game like this and I would have the replay, I don't think I would ever in a million years, they're complaining, right? Like, there's just so many objective failures, which aren't difficult theoretically at all. Like, I'm not even talking unit composition or anything like that, but just the fact that the saturation on the fort was extremely late, despite there being zero, literally zero pressure for the first eight minutes of the game Well, you could be saying, well, the tyranny was too stupid to put any pressure on But at the same time, if there's no pressure on you, then that's good for you If your opponent is stupid, you should be capable of abusing that The fact that you can't abuse your opponent being stupid makes you dumber, and then you should be allowed to lose Although that, I don't think he actually ever ended up scouting your opponent's starboard You literally had an overseer next to his main base. at like the eight or seven minute mark, something like that, how can you not figure out what's going on? As a result, your unit composition ends up being incorrect Like, I'm not even talking unit composition or anything like that Your injects legitimately sucked Your creep spread was terrible for nothing happening We had, what, like three lanes of creep in a 16-minute game, where once again, the Terran really did not clear too many creep tumors The Terran took out nine creep tumors total Like, how many did you end up with 17 tumors? It's just not good enough It really is just not good enough I'm not even sure if you've injected more than 10 times. I think maybe in the natural you've injected like four or five times, but on the other basis, like these bases might have gotten a single inject Like the macro has been improper The scouting was bad So your mechanics already kind of sucked And then on top of that, your game knowledge and your theoretical understanding of this matchup is absolutely non-existent You build Roach Hydra against Mind Battlecruiser You realize that doesn't work Then you remix on Ling Hydra After scouting that your opponent is in position with an army three times the size of yours, you decide to attack in Literally all of your decisions have been incorrect Your unit compositions have been incorrect the entire way through Like, there's no saving people like you. You're a opponent It doesn't matter if it's mine BC or if it would have been tank cyclone or if it would been mass store You would have built the wrong composition to counter it anyway Like honestly, having an ape decide what composition you'd have to play, probably Nets better result than this You sometimes have these monkeys that get to pick like 10 different stocks at the start of the year and I believe they used to always outperform like these professional stock pickers, these professional investors I feel the same here Like, if we'd get a monkey to pick your unit composition, just purely based on chance, there'd be a higher chance that he gets to a better comp And that's just really bad. So, yeah, we put that all together. And at the end of the day, my friend, it is not Terran that is Imba. It is not Terran that gives this guy an 83 percent win rate. It's people like you playing bad compositions with bad mechanics that give him that 83% win rate. It's not imba. You just suck. That's going to be it for today.

        "text": "Hello, Captain I am your fan from China Recently, I am very confused about PVT All-in is absolutely OP, exclamation mark Regardless of advantages or disadvantages, the Terran player can choose this powerful strategy thoughtlessly In this game, I got the nearly perfect defense for the push of Marines with tank Basically, I thought I've got the victory But what Terran player needs to do, was taking his army with SEVs and going to my base, just like going back his own home Damn! Exclamation mark The army of Protos is so crispy, just like my grandma's favorite cookies P S I don't want to play the late game with Terran My disruptor control is bad Because the imbalance of the PVT, I quit this game without GG. Just like what Stats said, the Protos is garbage this has to be one of the weirdest imbalance complaint forms He starts by complaining about All-ins, then that the late game, he doesn't want to play it But I think the main focus here is that Terran All-ins with SEVs are slightly too powerful, despite good early game defenses Now, the name of this player is Roberto Race is Protos, League Diamond, 4 5K MMR on the Korean server So it's a Chinese man playing on the Korean server It sounds a little bit like the name of a bad bad BBC TV show. But all of that behind us, let's hop straight into the game and see whether Roberto is correct and whether Terran SEV pools are imbalanced or if he sucks Here we have the base of who I assume to be Roberto, as he's the only Protos player in this game I was playing on a barcode, not even playing under his real name, and then being proud of not Gigiing That is the lowest of low Roberto, but I don't care I'm going to judge this game fair and square based on what I see and what I perceive Quick Probe Scout, start harassing this SCV, solid stuff. Always like seeing people just opening up with sensible build orders, and Roberto was opening up with a sensible build order Core before Nexus, probably is going to Cronoble without some type of adept, even trying to block his opponent's command center from going down This is just going to be a nice high-level game, isn't it? with concepts that make sense, with build orders that have been stolen and not made by themselves And that is my favorite type of lower level game It's when things make sense, it's the easiest to see where things go wrong for a player or whether something is truly in balance. If the game is super chaotic and I have no clue what's going on, it's often difficult for me to also kind of, first of all, see the thought process and truly judge whether something is imbalanced or not So Reaper's going to pop out So the probe moved towards the left side It's just, this is barely going to miss it It's very nice Good start here for Roberto, honestly Knows everything Knows that there's a Reaper as well because he didn't see an early Marine Got a lot of information with the initial scout Building positioning is somewhat okay We get a chronobust on the first adept as well I'm going to get a tech building after the first gateway unit. This is one of these things that could be considered What I was going to say, getting a Twilight Council before the second gateway unit can be considered a little risky because if you do that, you can send that first adapt across the map to scout because you don't have a second gateway unit However, you're still supposed to build that second gateway unit after the Twilight Council, even if it's going to be delayed Getting this fast second gateway does absolutely nothing for you unless you chronobo boost the warp gate Because the time it takes for a gateway to build is 46 seconds. That means when your warp gate research is on 56, out of a 54 out of 100 seconds, that's when you can start your gateway and it will simultaneously finish with your warp gate research That means that this gateway is going to be 20 seconds too quick And it makes no sense And for that, he's cutting out a second gateway unit So he's exposing himself to more risk for no real reason whatsoever And if you're exposing yourself to no risk, to a lot of risk for no reason whatsoever, that usually just isn't a very good thing If it's not necessary, I'd say no, no need. It's like the people that go swimming with sharks, you know, but then instead of using the cage, they don't use the cage around them It's like, well, I'm not quite sure what that's going to add, except maybe a little bit of adrenaline It just sounds very dangerous to me But yeah, this gate obviously isn't very useful We do have blink coming in, so that is nice We're not getting any chronoboose on it, which is diso pointing to me, but then again, life is a series of disappointment, and this is just a very small disappointment, so I cannot live with it. Sentry has a follow-up, kind of an old-school build as well with that sentry, will allow him to scout quickly across the map what his opponent is doing and then respond accordingly, but in case of any type of proxies or early pressure, it sometimes isn't so great to have that sentry because just a unit that doesn't do any damage And these two gates are now going to be turning into warp gates I do want to know that this second gateway that was built so early had not been used whatsoever yet this game, except for this first warp in just now Reaper is going to scout everything, is going to disappear. The Adept is moving back home after I think scouting a little bit as well, but really not achieving all that much So far this game honestly looks fairly standard I'm kind of okay with that This is actually a nice game If this is what 4 5K looks like on Korea, then I think that is a very good a very, very respectable level to be at Because both of these players seem to have a very good clue on what to do Oh my God This type of pisses me off as well when this happens You've got to be way more careful with your building placement. Also getting two gateways at this point isn't actually that useful because you don't even have the money to continuously be producing from these gateway You also, I just want to note this, which adds onto my frustration is you send out your hallucination too late You have the energy right now And as a result, you build these two gateways blindly without having any type of information The entire point of the sand tree is so that you can respond with your infrastructure to what you're seeing This makes no sense This is like buying a pair of glasses and then leaving them on the top of your hat for the entire day I know people who do this It doesn't work. Your eyesight will remain just as crap This is basically the same thing like, why even get the sentry if you're not planning on responding to what you're seeing? You're only going to be capable of responding to the unit movement right now, but you're not going to be capable of responding with any type of building You're already getting five gates If your opponent had opened up with Benchies right now or cloaked mines, you would have actually just straight up lost the game because you delay your robo by so much You cannot afford three extra gateways, continuous unit production, and also a robotics facility It is simply not possible. As a result, now you need to start cutting workers at a timing where you don't want to be cutting workers because you need to start where What are you doing? We're building centuries That's also not correct You do get a scout now Now, this is the most confusing scout in the world because this guy is building two extra barracks while moving out If you can make the reed somehow out of this that you're being attacked, I'd be very impressed I guess nothing being at home is a pretty decent tell But yeah, this is just It is the weirdest game And I'm usually not a fan of very weird games It started so good, but now you're on five gateways. Do you actually spot this move out? You don't quite know where the army is I do like this move, though You're kind of wanting to catch these units, and you're actually going to catch the reinforcements This is fantastic play I love this However, during this, you're not building any workers whatsoever And one of the main things while fighting a one-one-one type of push from a Terran is that if you allow the Terran to get more SCVs, while you're stuck on 46 workers, most of the time, even if you clean up this push, you're still not necessarily going to be ahead, especially if the follow-up is a triple-CC. That isn't quite the case this time around, but you've really got to be careful here and continuously build these workers You catch a tank Your unit position actually is very good I really, really do like this This is actually solid stuff It sucks that you have these three sentries, but they can be used for hallucinations here You could use like an immortal hallucination or two zealots extra hallucinated Guardian Shield, of course, also is viable Blink on top of this, take out the tank This was just a really, really good hold This actually just was a good halt With how little information you got, your unit movement was very solid The only problem is that you didn't spend a penny during this entire time. So you're actually only up three workers, but because your infrastructure is so good, and because you already have a third base, I still believe you're in a very, very advantageous position right at this moment Your opponent also didn't macro too well during this and continues rallying in So I think if you were to give this game to any top protels and you were to give the terran position to a top terran, it'd be like an 85 to 15% win chance for the protels at this point You can get your forges out, you're way up in supply, you can even expand to a fort base if you want currently because you're already kind of saturated on minerals on this base. This is the one thing that you're doing right now that I would not recommend is going for a straight-up attack Especially on right-clicking the bunker This is What are these guys doing? Just hold positioning This is not a very good move This was a really, really, really bad move even Do end up killing a lot of workers Maybe it's even worth it This literally was the only way you could lose, though If this bunker gets repaired a little bit better, and this tank sieges up slightly faster, you'll end up losing all of your stalkers, your map control, your momentum, and your map control is going to be really, really important when your opponent eventually pushes out, so your opponent's already getting five wrecks. So you're basically handing your opponent an opportunity, it's like, hey, here is a lot of my army, and exchange for that, I want a bunch of your SCVs But his army remains relatively strong throughout this, and especially his tech unit stay alive What you could have done instead is try to blink into the main base, maybe snipe this tank, try and snipe a tech lab, jump around the bunker, work against the tank This is a really bad tail end of the fight as well Literally losing everything here, buddy That is not good Oh, Roberto, you silly barcode I think major harassment while tacking into something else, like maybe one forge, a Templar archives, yeah. Basically what you're doing right now, getting a prism set up, all of this would have been perfect if you would have done it before you lost eight stalkers and ten zealots for in exchange for like 10, 12 SUVs Right now, I'm not so sure if this is what you want to be focusing on because you already have the lead in the worker count at this point Before this, you had the lead in an army and you had the lead in, well, you had like a third base, basically Those were your main leads You also had very good infrastructure Right now, you kind of traded that army lead in favor of being up in Eco So over time, you're already outmining your opponent. What you need to be focusing on right now is producing army that fights for you, not things that can get you further at, like a war prism, like a Nexus I do like the Templar archives because you want some type of tech, as there's no upgrades for you still whatsoever But I think your main focus right now should be in producing more army than your opponent because you just killed what was it? 15 workers or so Actually, legit 15 works Oh, a sick guess out of me Holy crap I never got to participate in one of these marble guessing games, you know, where there's a jar with marbles in it And if you guess the amount of marbles correct, you had like 10K. I bet I'd be really good at that If any of you have pictures of marbles, please feel free to send them to my email address And I will guess how many marbles are in the jar It wouldn't surprise me if that is one of my many hidden talents What is a non-hidden talent, though, is seeing that this is an investment that does not necessarily make a lot of sense in this moment I'd be down with two extra gates being added, maybe even three gates if you don't get this extra nexus But adding all of this stuff right now, this is all investment into the future, except there is no future This forge is not going to be used. These gateways might get a single warping in This nexus is not going to be used for the most important attack that is coming right now it was obvious your opponent was going to attack you with a powerful attack because you just killed a bunch of his eco He is forced to all in or play from very far behind economically, even if you didn't have a fort base So, yeah, I'm not a huge fan I guess you're going to be able to spend most of your money because of this, which is somewhat nice. You're going to be giving up this base immediately, which once again, you have a lot of surprisingly good calls on when to engage the Terran army and how to do that against these pushes, but the moment you have to make decisions based on what you want to attack or what you actually want to do, you're really bad It's like you kind of have like a split brain of when it comes to decision making, understanding how to fight defensively, but everything else seems to be hot garbage This also is not a good position for these units But why would you. If you look at this fight, okay? And you see your Arkon just bumping into your sentry, like he's in a bar fight screaming, Don't hold me back I don't think the play is to warp 10 more zealids behind this army, which already is completely stuck and can't move anywhere You obviously want to be warping in over here or even warping in on the left side of this pylon Like, it is fairly obvious to me that this is not the play because these zealots are just going to be bumping into your army until your buildings disappear You do blink back and make some space for it It actually was not bad I do like that move. But you're fighting very far away from your Shield Battery as well There was no real flank Warp Prism got a little bit too late This would have been a sick move We also could have warped like the nine Zealots here, yeah, to go for a faster flank They actually probably would have been a good call too I do like that you realize that at this point I feel like all of these concepts are kind of in your head, but they're not completely coming out at time I really do respect the way you fight and the way you think about fights This is actually, it's not common to see this at 4. 5K MMR that someone actually thinks a lot about how they want to fight Very often it's like, oh, I need to fight now They'll get that time incorrect, but then, you know, the actual concept on how to fight and what the appropriate way is to engage an army is often incorrect And here you're kind of getting blasted It's not a good position for you I'm not even quite sure if this is a playable position for you Honestly, going to lose a lot of workers here as well You're down to upgrades You recall half of your probe The other half gets left behind to die Still have a decent army, though Your opponent has really crap eco as well. The problem with this is, is that in these scenarios, when the Taryn eventually mines out and they can just fly over to a third base, life just becomes so hard for Toss often It's just a bad situation You're also stuck on such a crap army without upgrades Like unless the Tarrin completely forgets the micro, or forgets the stim for the first part of the fight It's just going to be hard I like this I really do like this This is a good cleanup Actually, nice cleanup Kind of have a flank here, naturally coming in from the natural with these zealots This was a good cleanup, dude This was very cool You also build a Nexus. Once again, I'm kind of appreciating the anticipation for a longer game here, where it's like, hey, if I want to survive in this game, I need to out-expand my opponent because he just better stuff You're even harassing with a prison The only thing we're kind of missing is like either storm research, an upgrade or a Robo Bay I kind of say either storm or yeah, storm here is the correct, how double gas as well? Like how is this possible that so many of your decisions are good? And then now you're going to attack Intim This would actually be a terrible, a terrible, terrible plan This is exactly the same as that initial fight if you do commit here. Let's see if you actually are going to commit or not Yeah, it seems to be the case It's the same as that first fight It's like you just took out a man's, like 34 SCVs, you're taking your own third base, and you're tacking into a better tech This is the timing where you absolutely do not want to be fighting Your opponent is at peak strength, and you're at your lowest strength right now Like, and then you're also getting counterdropped at the same time So this is like double jeopardy Okay, can you say that? Is that how double jeopardy works? I'm not quite sure I think this is double jeopardy And that's not a good thing, if I recall correctly. Hey, you should have just stayed home Set up this base, get your tech out You're already getting the storm, which is good Just get a couple of Templar ready for inevitably the next push You could have figured this out as well because you had a freaking observer Why don't you use that before you decide whether to once again kind of suicide into your opponent's army? Blink in Hello? It's two marauders, mate You don't need your entire army there Your five stalkers and one zealot would have been plenty to kill this Now you're going to be caught out of position This guy stims into your third base You lose it Luckily for you, this terran is not responding whatsoever. But even if he goes in towards your natural, you're going to be fighting from an absolutely atrocious position If the terran positions himself properly, good old mellow, that could be good Arcon's moving forward Actually, it's a good fight It's a good fight for you once again Again, not enough Metavex for Mello Not enough Metavex for Mello Actually, kind of holding here I'm surprised how good these fights are going with no upgrades whatsoever Also, can I just I'm wondering why there's no Storm despite or no Templar despite Storm being researched That's buying like six boxes of ammunition and then not having a gun He's like, well, the ammunition is nice, but you're not going to be shooting anyone with that. Like, you're not going to throw the bullets Idiots It doesn't work throwing bullets You're going to throw something You should throw like a hammer or something They hurt a lot when I was playing Super Mario, I remember That's one of the harder levels when I was a kid It's where you had these hammer idiots throwing at you Because they don't go in a straight line It's not very predictable They also jump up and down Hammer bros were truly broken Kind of like Do I like this? No, you could have just defended this I don't like this I was talking about the hammer bros too much You completely missed this army Good map vision. I think you could have fought this, no? I think you could have You're not necessarily up in Eco, but you're up a base You have better tech than your opponent You have 600 gas Once again, just being defensive here probably would have been the best thing It's not like attacking into your opponent is going to make your army better It actually makes it worse in this case And because you're the one that needs time to build up and to get Templar out to get storm Once again, staying home would have been the correct call You once again went for the incorrect call just a little bit to trigger happy And as a result, you're going to lose your third base. And it really was the only advantage that you had this game Your army is smaller Your worker count is lower Your army is slightly worse quality as well, I think You have three arc ones Maybe it's better quality, actually Slightly better quality And especially with these Templars in here now So you're just going to expand towards the far right side I lost so many workers, though This game is just going to be so, so difficult right now Because you know, yeah You know that eventually this is going to going to happen This always happens eventually. So you need to just be up like 12, 13 workers, and you need to always be up a base against Theron in these type of scenarios as well You're not up a base anymore You're not up 12, 13 workers anymore either It means you're pretty dead, or at least, I think you're pretty dead You still have Storm, which is a great comeback mechanic, but so far your positioning pre-fight has not necessarily been super brilliant Your map vision is very poor as well You never know where there's drops coming You don't have an observer anymore either I do like the DTs I think DTs are an okay call Not great And the reason it's not great because you don't have plus one attack. And that means that these DTs are going to be two swiping SCVs rather than one-shotting them And that is not entirely what you want Usually You have to double swipe It's not cool Oh, turret's also going down right now A single scan This is so risky You should never put them in the same spot made Always, always, always split them up Oh, I guess you didn't know there was a third base yet This little army is here taking out everything as well Big scan Is there another scan available? It's not quite seem to be the case Nope, there's one more scan available actually How is this army still alive? I feel like they should have been taken out years ago. Blink the stalker or don't blink the stalker I don't care You can do what you want Yeah, this just looks really, really bad, honestly You're going to need an absolute miracle to come back into this game don't see much of a miracle worker So I'm not completely feeling it Also, at this point, I think getting DTs is not really worth it because your opponent is relatively compact in the setup It's not like he spread out with 12 bases that all don't have a turret Like, you already saw that there was a turret being built You know that there's maximum going to be like, what, two bases DT is a bit of a waste of money I prefer seeing more Templar here personally. But, yeah, I don't know You can't even really delay these pushes because there's just going to be scans available, right? Yeah, it's just saving up scams Like, this guy is an idiot This is actually a good level I really like this level of play, like between both players There's a lot of good decisions being made Also some bad decisions, well, a lot of bad decisions, especially by Roberto But overall, it's like kind of okay with it Good for a storm It's like a zoning storm of sorts Where's the other Templars, though? I don't I see them I clicked them Oh, they're all here? No, it's just two here Oh, there's one in the main base Okay. I don't mind that completely against any potential drops Once again, now you're going to try and move out At this point, I'd say that moving out might not even be the worst call And it's not because I think that a move out is going to be working, but right now you have a power spike because you have Templar and your opponent doesn't have a counter to the Templar yet So this is the first time where you actually should be attacking, because the longer the game goes, the worse it's going to be getting for you You're downing workers, you're down in upgrades, and you're not really transitioning into anything later. So yeah, this is, despite this looking like a worse fight than the previous fights, this is still most likely the correct goal And this is just really unfortunate You know, the timing of the terrain here is quite good And, yeah, that just sucks You know, like, I can't say much more than that It just sucks for you But you need to engage into this Not the greatest storms I think one hit the army, the other one hit your own zealots Yeah, the game is honestly pretty much over at this point I do appreciate that you're going in and that you're trying There's a low army as well from the terror You're actually going to be almost. Kill this! Kill the tank! Still had storms available as well That actually might have been possible This army is so low If you hit one more storm, it just all disappears A lot of crap here as well. I mean, the recall here, the moment you do this recall you know that the game is actually over because there's no way that in your next attempt you're going to have a better time than in the previous attempt and the previous attempt already was garbage so now you know the next attempt is going to be awful as well it's not like you saved some massive eco that you had at home it's not like this was a gold base with 15 patches with 40 probes and 12 mules working on it no it was four blue mineral patches with 21 worker over saturation It's like you're missing like 400 minerals a minute It's like these three extra zealots weren't going to change the game. This goes not being in the army The fact that this entire army was red when you teleported back home, that was going to change a game That could have perhaps given you the opportunity to win the game But at this point, I mean, we know that the game is actually completely over A single EMP should win the game Oh my God What is this response time? What is this? Look at this Look at this prison Look at this guy Drop the Templar? The other, the, the ghost has like five minutes to aim the EMP Look at this One, two Boof I hope a fly never tries to get into your eye. Because by the time you figure out there's a fly there, like the axe that he laid in your eye will have given birth already Holy crap, you're slow Yeah, and then you type leave without Gigi like an honorable macro protos that you are Roberto, I have to admit, I actually was somewhat happy with a lot of the things that you did And I'll actually start with that I think that the way you approach a lot of these attacks, when it came to the timing of your engagements against the initial tank push, you really did fantastic with very little information Your control was good, your understanding of how to cut off reinforcements, and then the time of when to engage also was very good. However, every single time you did something good, it's like you had an angel and a devil on your shoulder And every single time you did something right, you immediately had to kind of balance out the skills and do something so insanely stupid that it would baffle a bronze one player It's like your attack timings made so little sense Just you're having this massive lead and the only way to throw it away, you figure it out and you do it Consistently, just consistently, you manage to figure out a way to throw a lead just straight out of the window. It is a special skill, but it's a special skill that no one wants, and thus I would not be advertising it if I were you And right now, you're advertising it for the world to see I agree that Terran Allins can be very, very powerful, but there is a really sweet trick against Terran Al-Lins, and that is not losing your entire army a minute before the Terran is about to attack into you If you know your opponent is stuck on two bases with Crap Eco and it's just going to continuously be attacking into you, why in the world would you attack into their defensive position first, especially if there is tanks? That makes absolutely no sense. The army of Protos is not crispy like your grandmas cookies The army of your proto is actually hard like a freaking brick that we built houses from, We're powerful We can take a lot of damage, but attacking into defensive terran positions isn't one of the things that Protos armies are good at Why would you do that? It just makes absolutely no sense On top of that, you get storm Don't get Templar for the big push So that's a lot of money that you just kind of throw out of the window and also a lot of potential against a majority Marine army that you could have dealt Put it all together I don't think Terran all-ins are overpile I think you, Roberto, just suck. That's the reality of the case here, my friend You just suck All right It's going to be it for today's episode of Is It Inba or Do I Suck?

        "text": "Dear Harsta, usually I think that the game is pretty balanced, since I know I'm not on high enough level to really complain about the balance. But as is the case sometimes, I feel like I was just crushed and I have no idea what I've done wrong. I mean, sure, my build wasn't really optimal, neither my decision making, but was my composition as well, (also probably since I have wanted to try Roach Hydra instead of my usual Ling Banes). Though I feel like the ghost are just too well-rounded, you can't really attack into Terran, with roaches if he does three cc since he can easily death with banshee and fuel siege tanks without losing harass potential cause metaphics with marines and banshees are good at this as well You really need to start using periods Yes, I know that I shouldn't have attacked with the roaches and ravagers into three siege tanks Bad decision out of me losing 20 army supply for nothing Though I have no idea how was I supposed to defend the last attack I really respect you and I love what you're doing for this game. I know I am bad and I would like to improve, but sometimes I just can't see what I do wrong, which is more of a reason why I am DMing you really then believing the game is in balance But if I were to say what was the thing I have felt a bit overwhelmed by were the ghost from both sides since I am a random player most of the time One hell of an essay over here Name White Raven, but this season has a name change, named himself Sigma Mill. Now, for the people that don't live terminally online, a Sigma Mill is, I have an actual definition, A Sigma Mill is a slang term used in masculinist subcultures for a popular, successful, but highly independent and self-reliant man And this honestly seems to be a moniker that is earned You can't really claim it So him calling himself Sigma Mill is not allowed So instead what I did is I googled four characteristics of the average Sigma Mill And that's one The Sigma Mill is adaptable, independent successful and above all is a non-conformist And then it says behind this, he walks to the beat of his own drum I googled this and I figured this out. So not only am I going to figure out in this game whether Terran is in balance and specifically the ghost, but we'll also figure out if you're allowed to keep playing under the name Sigma Mill or if you claimed it unrightfully So let's hop straight into it All right, in the bottom right we have Sigma Mill, our 3 9 9K Diamond Zirk player on the European ladder And top left here, we will be seeing our Blue Terran player Probably a similar MMR Otherwise, they would not be matched up against one another. So we're going to be just, you know, checking whether this player actually is a true Sigma mill and whether ghosts are overpowered or if the reason that he lost is something else And maybe something to do with him sucking, perhaps a little bit We have to go and figure that out So far, the openers are pretty standard I'm a huge fan of that I really just like it There is something special There's really something special about seeing people do proper openers I'm always happy when I just see a standard hatchery first and a standard barracks expand on the other side of the map It just made me all, you know, my tummy feel good You know, little butterflies in there, and I'm happy. Life is just a lot better when things are normal I don't like things that are odd Gas pool as well, even rallying the correct drones our man, Invoid Sigma Mill so far is doing a fantastic job Leaving the second overlord at home, I would not mind if you just pop out with that second overlord a little bit close by to check if there's any close-by proxies You can get back in time towards your little high ground as well It allows you to at least spot one location with that overlord and then respond in case of it being like some type of proxy two racks or even a proxy three racks or in the worst case a proxy four racks. Of course, these are all viable builds that Terran can do that are extremely powerful If you can scout against it, that would be fantastic I think you pulled into gas a little bit too quick, but I'm going to forgive it Usually you saturate your minerals first and then you start rallying into the gas You don't straightaway rally into gas and then pull one extra worker into it That's what you do in ZVZ, not quite in ZVT Everything else seems pretty much standard build order-wise SEV Scout coming out of the Terran as well, who's also opening up with a very solid one barracks expanse. forgets to build the marine might end up going into a fast reactor because of that no just gets a marine a little bit later that's completely fine i am okay with it first two links coming out no third base yet but this is kind of odd that there's no drone at either of these bases usually you patrol a drone at this base i would say um and you also are supposed to get four links rather than just to despite pride being a slightly larger map it's still nice to have four links or the reapers going have a way too easy time Now that you did not put a drone over here, you will not be capable of getting a hatchery down. And that is going to delay your build order You already see you're floating four, 500 minerals and now you start up the hatchery This is the type of play that is relatively naive, I think This really should never work and it shouldn't, and it also doesn't That also kind of makes me happy if you make a bad decision and you get punished for it Yeah, I, you know, that does make me happy generally 310, your hatchery does eventually go down with some tricks, but it's not a very solid start Reaper saw practically everything as well so far, killed one Ling You're getting your creep chumers out. So, build order wise, somewhat okay, despite your third base being a little bit delayed, which is not brilliant Getting your overlords out I think this overlord might be a little bit too fast, the one that you're building right now It's not the biggest of deal You can Continuing to mine gas, which is surprising, especially because you already have your link speed done as well So you've got a very fast link speed, then you continue mining gas, which lowers your overall mineral income And in the early game, of any matchup, the longer you can delay your gas, the better it tends to be for your economy. And this is especially true for Zirk, because everything that creates economy is mineral-based, queens, hatcheries, nexus, probes, drones, SUVs Everything that would increase your economy that you require to build a better eco only cost minerals Gas cuts into that If you have 10 drones working in gas, instead of working on minerals, you're going to get a slower fort base You're going to get a slower third base Building more queens is going to be impossible So for Zirk very often, you want to limit your gas income until the very last moment where it's going to be possible. You need that initial gas for the link speed, but then afterwards what you want to be doing is you don't want to get any gases yet, because it is not good And it's going to lower your queen count, which when you're a Zerk player is honestly the most important thing And perhaps this is where your Sigma-Milness kind of comes into play as you're a non-conformist And you see everyone else building queens, you're like, no, I can do that better I can just do it without queens That does mean that you're struggling against Hellion harassed though There is a reason why people build queens and is to defend this type of pushes. because if there was an armory with this and there would be like four cars, you would be completely dead You're lucky that there's no armory and that you have 13 roaches on the way, but this is really bad You also decided not to scout, because apparently that's what the cool kids do these days, not scouting And as a result, you get caught completely off guard You don't have queens to tank the hit for a little bit You might actually end up losing your third base here, which would be kind of game ending in a way But even if you don't end up losing this third base, this still wasn't the greatest start for you I love this drop towards the main base. Terran realizing, hey, this is a roach defense, that means probably that my Hellenes will be capable of doing something I'd also like to kind of draw attention that despite you just building, what is it, 18 roaches, you are currently still floating 200 gas, which is completely useless So you just wasted a lot of mineral income and instead are just floating gas for no real reason You've lost nine workers This is not a good trade for you Lost a lot of mining time those nine workers and you're continuing to build roaches As a Zirk player, the thing you often want to be doing is when you defend something, is to immediately drone up, take another base because you already have these units. You're going to be safe for the next legit minute and a half That allows you to drone up to 84, 85 drones Your opponent honestly just hasn't been macroing so well And you could have had a massive advantage here But instead, you're continuing building roaches you're morphing ravagers, you're not adding in any extra drones just now After building, I think, an additional seven, eight roaches, you start building drones and increasing your economy, getting your hatchery But these drones should already be mining This hatchery should already be maybe 20 seconds faster, and that really does help You move up this ramp, you see that there's two tanks, three tanks You allow every tank to shoot twice. You lose a bunch of units, and then you decide to go back So despite the initial misjudgment, you do make the the correct call and don't go back in again I'm not quite sure why you would rebuild Reviters at this point There's no danger of being attacked soon and you can't walk up this ramp again Surely you must be aware of it at this point I love that this Terran's macro isn't great, but he's making the correct moves, you know? Just scouting around I don't think this Terran is super fast Yeah, it's not super fast, but actually is making correct calls It's an interesting move Oh no, I'm about to lose a ravager to a Benchy. Let me just sacrifice my entire army into a position where I know there's three tanks This is the type of high-level thinking that I'm sure the Sigma Mill community would like to have amongst them Like you just literally threw away the only lead you had Because you didn't have an eco-lead, because you built a lot of units The one thing you did have going for you was the fact that you were completely safe and that you were allowed to drone up till infinity and beyond as bus light year would say However, instead of doing that, you decided to throw away your safety and now you have no army and no eco rather than just having no eco. It's the type of brilliant thinking that a conformist like me would never be capable of getting to I still think you should be capable of making a defense Not a huge fan of this Terran move out personally Roaches make it really easy easy to defend this type of push usually, especially if there's not a big enough marine count and a not enough tank count Marines and tanks scale really well against roaches, but initially in like the 120 to 150 supply range of Zirk, Roach Queen is extremely strong defensively, especially mixed in a couple of ravagers for Biles on the tanks So despite this looking quite bad, I still think you're going to be holding. Of course, this game should actually be completely over already in favor of the Terran, but because he's not macroing, you still have a chance And you're managing to barely hold on This should have been, if you just would have stayed at home and he would have made this attack and you had your 20 extra roaches, he never would have been capable of taking the third base either So your idiocy of moving up the ramp actually allowed him to move across the map and take a third base Now, him moving across the map did not do him too many favors. I have to admit, he lost his entire tank count, which is now non-existent, did clear a little bit of creep and forced out a lot of units But once again, you have pretty much map control You can take your gases, you can drone up, you can take a fifth base, and with this Roach Hydra composition, the most important thing is to get into the hive quickly You want to be able to reach Vipers if the tank count grows massively and you want the lurker upgrades because if you're playing a Roach Hydra composition, which by the way is not a standard composition whatsoever, it's not very often played anymore. Some people that do it at the high level, but most players play either Lingbane, Hydra Lingbane, or some type of Lingban, Murat's very Lingban focused But yeah, if you want to play like this, it is absolutely vital that you're rushing to that hive because your army is complete garbage without any of, of these hive upgrades Without vipers, without seismic spines on your lurkers, there's absolutely no shot that you're dealing any damage They're building slightly too many hydras here, I think I still believe you could probably either be droning up a little bit more, or you want to rely more on your roaches defensively. Roach is just a little bit stronger defensively, especially if you can morph them into ravagers, a delaying push-out, making sure tanks can't get into good positions And hydras are quite expensive as well and don't really contribute much into a fight The only real purpose they have is functioning as some type of anti-air Now, this drop, I think you spotted it, but you just split your army in effectively So yeah, it's just a little bit unfortunate You're going to get cleaned up here, I think, because it's pure hydrogens marine Might be able to clean it Okay, that's nice at least That is something Still don't have an infestation pit Still don't have a lurker then. it's not necessarily bad that if you're playing like a very roach-based composition rather than getting hydras is adding a couple of spores in like key locations so you express some creep in the main put a spore on the edge put like a spore over here on the edge one spore over here on the edge that that makes it more difficult for Terran players to do this type of dropping abuse because you don't have well you don't have any queen you have two queens right now both of them spreading creep as well by the way i love that's like larva injections no that's not for me I just grind out those larva naturally with the hatchery I don't need inject So unnatural. Don't want any of that Okay Here comes the Lurker then and the infestation pit at the same time I think I mentioned it first at like the 8 30 mark So this is about two and a half minutes late I do appreciate it that you end up building it But usually the way that this matchup kind of kind of flows I kind of want to explain that in this specific scenario where you have a roach hydra composition, the way that it flows is that initially Zirk with a roach opener might have a Roach 1-1 timing So it kind of, you know, the Zerk is the aggressive one. If the Terran holds that or if the Zirk thinks he can't attack into that, then sometimes afterwards Terran has a bit of a tank timing which should hit by the timing you have hive So you want your viper's out most of the time against that type of timing And then after you hold that timing and you have your lurker them with the seismic spines, the ball rolls back into the zirc cord And that is the point where this specific composition that we're watching right now is the strongest It's when the lurkers are out, it's usually when there's like eight, nine tanks, but there's no ghost yet. Because there's often a high lurker count, you can still attack into positions, makes it really difficult for the Tarynx to defend because they don't have high orbital counts with a lot of scans and they don't have ghosts yet However, in this particular game, because your early and midgame have been complete garbage, we're in a situation where the opponent is producing six ghosts at a time while you don't even have your hive started yet He's like two entire steps ahead of you Like, he isn't going to be doing it He did, I guess, some type of tank push earlier, lost all of his tanks But you're never going to grab the map control at this point So the situation is just complete garbage. In this type of game, what you want to be doing is you kind of want to be bunkering up, sitting back, and wait until you hopefully can get some momentum back to you You can get on the map again and start dealing some damage The reason for that is that you need to wait to have a major advantage After a fight maybe where he attacks into you, and then you can counterattack, maybe take out the base you still will continuously need to play very careful because ghosts are out already He is so far attack wise ahead of you that is just going to be difficult for you to fight. So attacking into this with ghost and tanks in position without seismic spines is a suicide mission It really is a suicide mission and I would not, I really would not recommend it, especially because you see what's going on You see, well, I guess this is good because you get two tanks for free, but you know that there's ghosts there You just I don't really think you can attack into this I really don't think you can Not with these low-range lurkers Oh my God, this is just not good No adaptive talents, no nothing He's just moving out of range He's going to scan and then he's going to snipe one more time. If there was just like one extra tank here, you would be in so much trouble But even without that tank being here, you're in so much trouble You lost your entire, like, your cannon fodder that is really needed in front of the lurkers Once again, especially if they don't have range You still don't know, you do have a hive actually This is a weird skin It tricked me I have no one used this in a tournament He really would trick me Looks like a layer It really does Ugly skin It's like the beak of one of these flying dinosaurs almost, no? Article I'm not sure what the flying dinosaurs are called. I'm not going to make any guess or do we some dinosaur expert making fun of me in the YouTube comments You always have this one guy This is the problem with having an audience of more than five people There's always going to be some extra expert in the YouTube comments or in your Twitch chat that knows way more and they're always calling you out as well So they're one moment to shine It's got you've been studying the flying the flying T-Rex dinosaur for the past 35 years of his life and there I misspeak in a 45-minute rant It's like a freaking essay about what type of idiot I am I'm not falling for it Flying dinosaur with the big beak. That's what I'm calling them Yeah Adaptive Talents here is the first upgrade, not a huge fan of that And I know what you guys are going to say, well, I see Dark at the adaptive talents upgrade before the seismic spine a lot Yes And that is because Dark most of the time when he wants to do something is he wants to do some type of aggressive rotations If you're wanting to be defensive or if you're forced into being defensive, like a good friend Sigma Mill is over here, seismic spines obviously has way more advantages, especially because he's not in six or seven base so he doesn't even need to make any real defensive rotations. He's on five bases, which means that there's two sides that he really needs to defend That's the left side, and you guessed it, the right side I guess you have this middle as well, but you kind of automatically defend it You have enough lurkers to spread it out So seismic spines would have been way superior here As we see, the Terran just moving out with just a massive ghost force At this point, I don't think you're completely dead You look to be in a pretty bad spot It's hard when you play this style to counter attack because you'll be investing a significant portion of your army that's not very good at running away It's not very speedy. So yeah, you can't really, and it also can't really kill planetaries or workers very quickly, unlike Bainlings, which is the unit that you usually use for this type of run by Ling Bainling, yeah, it's great Lings can even pick off reinforcements fast, but you're running like 15 roaches here It just ups the depot, snipes a couple of times and nothing you can do It just runs away with the SEVs You can't really chase them I think this is, interesting setup and this is the type of scenario I was gonna say before you made that move, that this is the type of scenario where you need to realize that your army is proper balls at this point. Okay? You have an army consisting out of 10 lurkers, 10 without seismic spines and you're fighting a 14 ghost army You don't even want to commit into this position in the first place because if this terran would snip every single unit, you'll die Here you say, okay, I don't want to fight pre-Sysmic spines I'm going to be pulling these workers away I might drop one or two lurkers over here and leave the vipers close by So it's a little bit harder for him to continuously engage But you got caught out of position, give up this base You're already expanding towards the top side Pull away the workers Don't even pretend like you want to hold this base. Because the moment you do that, you're going to lose everything But rather than that, you cast a blinding cloud, which you then run into with your entire Roach Army And then, if that isn't enough yet, you decide to move into the Terran concave with your non-range lurkers and end up losing every single lurker in this game Every single one, there's none left And you just lose Also, you don't Gigi After, in my opinion, a very well played game by this Terran Sure, his macro wasn't too tight, but he made a lot of very good decisions This guy knew how to drop as well, knew how to move his army, understood what was needed to kill this composition. You were like, hey, I'm not playing asling Bain Thanks, ghost This is exactly what I want Fast extra expansions as well behind us Look at that Extra orbitals This guy knew very well what was going on and countered you perfectly The least you could give him is a freaking good game here But, yeah, let's just talk a little bit about your main complaint, which was the ghost here I don't even really think the ghost mattered too much We saw like four or five snipes go down when you moved into this army But even if this was an army consisting of 30 marauders instead, so we replace every ghost with a marauder, you still would have lost moving into that concave. You just moved into the ultimate terran concave, who was equal upgrades to you, and you didn't have your seismic spines Like, I don't understand how you can blame the ghost And even before that already, it feels like the game is over because of your terrible early game decisions You're completely skipping out queens, literally the only S-tier unit that Zerk has Queen is by far the best unit that they have It allows you to continuously get economy while also getting defensive units because they don't cost larva It's like this sick unit made by some Zerk genius and you built three of them There's points in the game where you have two queens on four hatcheries This is incomprehensible to me. I understand that you're a non-conformist, but this is just plain stupid This is like, rather than pooping in your toilet, pooping in your fridge, because everyone else already poops in their toilet It just doesn't make any sense whatsoever, and it's also very unsanitary So, yeah, let's just start with the Sigma Milness What did I have written down? I had adaptable, independent, successful, and a non-conformist Now, adaptable, you weren't really adaptable at all You did not realize in many situations, for example, that you didn't want adaptive talent here, that you wanted to go into high faster, that you needed to camp rather than to attack. It feels like you have a setup plan in your head, and no matter what happens during the game, you're going to be following the plan, which can be quite good, but you're now hitting a level where there's actually other factors Like, hey, my early game is crap Okay, maybe I need to be a little bit more defensive, try to get back into a different way So no, you're not adaptable whatsoever We can cross that out Two, independent Well, you're asking me for advice in a freaking balanced complaint form So no, you're not independent You require my help So on that also, a big fat Red Cross Three, successful You just lost this game to a Taron that was continuously floating 3K minerals. So also, you're not successful Four, nonconformist and specific specifically walking to the beat of his own drum And on that, I'll have to say yes You are a non-conformist and you walk to the beat of your own drum Sadly, the beat of the drum sounds a little bit similar, like an idiotic two-year-old that hits his fork on the table, screaming that he wants food And although it is cute with a two-year-old, your drum isn't cute anymore It's a little bit pathetic So, my good friend, despite you hitting, one out of four characteristics I'm going to say that you're not a Sigma Mail And I'm also going to say that the ghost is not in balance, but instead, my friend, that you do suck. So denied on both points I'm sorry That's going to be it for today Thanks all so much for watching I'm expecting a name change out of Sigma Mail And I'm expecting you guys to like this video Hit the subscribe button and I'll see you on next week for another I know also tomorrow I have another video I'll just watch these videos every day on this channel Link in the description Ah, if you want to submit your own thing Very cool Thank you and bye bye."

        "text": "Hello Captain This was a Zirk vs Terran game that made me realize that Terran is Inba And Zerk is absolute trash This build that the Terran player played was the stupidest build that I've ever seen He never got more than one barracks, factory and Starport until 8 minutes He proxied a reactor Starport and proceeded to spam the Liberators into my base with no regards if they survived The Liberators once shot all of my larvae so that I could no longer produce any unit To be honest, I wasn't playing my best, and I was a bit late on the spores But the very fact that Terrans can shut down a Zerk's entire production with a few liberators is stupid. So, is it Imba or do I suck? I love that this guy, in the balance complaint form, already says that he wasn't playing him best He's already making the excuses, protecting his ego I have a feeling this is going to be a great game The name is Terran Master The race is Zirk is Diamond, 3 5K MMR, and the server is North America So the question is, is it Imba or do I suck? Great stuff over here on Curious Minds Penny versus the Terran Master, and the Terran Master is going to be the player that we will be paying attention to Despite the name, do not get tricked by that, it is indeed a Zirk player with so far an absolutely perfect builder. Look at that Overlord pop-out, double drones as well the same time we have the Terran, Penny, starting with a gas first This is a very uncommon build order for Terran as it delays the initial barracks a little bit, but it allows you to get a faster factory while building a Reaper That is the main advantage that this builder has We also see an extremely quick SEV Scout I'm not quite sure what this is all about Almost feels like Penny wanted to hedge block, except didn't quite very much remember the time of when the initial hatchery goes down Because this doesn't look great Okay, we have a second refinery on the way That is indeed quite interesting. Now, there were some complaints in the imbalance complaint form about the build order of the Terran player So we're going to keep an eye on that I think that is only fair, of course I'm still not entirely sure what exactly was imbalanced It seemed like Terran Master was complaining about the fact that Liberators could one-shot larva This is the first time that I've ever heard that complaint in my life A bunker Okay And a factory at home as well? Five SUVs in gas Well, this is I've never seen this before either I don't think this is on purpose Yeah, okay One worker gets pulled out and another worker gets pulled out But yeah, this is definitely not on purpose. That was a massive mistake We get a second depot And this bunker will finish up The SUV will immediately run away No need to repair it No cesspenny I am just going to run this SUV to the top side of the map where it will be safe from any of these angry Zirks influences Zerk so far knows that there is no command center on the natural So start a spine crawler Make some sense, right? You also see a bunker Might be something like a Forex, but instead it's going to be a proxy starboard. Now, one of the first priorities that I would have, if I were a Zirk player, I know that there is no command center, and I know that a bunker just got built, I would start scouting around the map, just sending one link towards the top side and one link towards the bottom side I can, of course, can't completely blame Tarrantmaster for not doing that It does take a little bit of APM What I wouldn't do, however, is build 10 extra links The Zerk has a beautiful little thing called the queen And the queen can be built while you're producing workers from your larva As a Zerk player, generally, you need to decide between units or drones. But the queen is kind of the exception because the queen is a defensive unit that doesn't cause larva And you can build this unit while you're building drones So ideally what you want to be doing in this type of situation is you just continue drone production You scout around the map you check if your opponent is moving out with the links, and then you just build queens and drones You get a very good eco, you're saving up energy on your queens, and you know that your opponent does not have a command center yet Now, the beauty of the queen is that it doesn't only attack ground, but yes, it also shoots up. On top of that, it has an amazing amount of tanking ability, it has decent damage output, and they can heal each other So really, it is the catch-all solution for Zerg against anything that can be constructed off of one base What doesn't really work well is the Zergling The Zergling basically sucks against anything that Terran can build It's bad against Marines It's bad against mines It sucks against Hellions It's not great against tank pushes Banelings are good, but right now the Zerg player isn't really at an economy to get Banelings out It's just simply not possible I also love, by the way, that he built this entire line of Zerglings just to move them back home, not scout around the map. We've been supply blocked at 35 out of 36 for what felt like five minutes Now we lost an overlord and we're actually supply blocked at 28 The 28 supply block is something we don't see very often That means that there's only two overlords on the map currently Four minutes into the game For just a point of reference, I think the standard timing for your third overlord to usually finish is actually like maybe 205 or 210 So yeah, this doesn't look very good The eco here and the general state of the game, it feels like we moved back in time That's not a positive thing usually in StarCraft 2 If I haven't had a time machine, that would be a very positive thing. I'd be doing great things with it, like buying lots of Bitcoin in 2009, writing down all the lottery numbers. like I'd be I'd be a great person let me tell you that much predict loads of future events as well I'd be the true one Oracle I thought about this actually before that if I would if I would be capable of traveling back in time to predict future events what would most likely happen is that some government would kidnap me put me in a room and force me to do the future telling for them so you probably wouldn't you kind of want to keep a low profile you know you wouldn't want to be able to predict everything just every now and again and just like one of these people like one of the carnival people with the crystal ball you want to just kind of throw stuff out there so every now and again you're right and you point that see I'm right but you also want to have a backlog of predictions that are completely incorrect so that when the FBI comes knocking at your door you say no no no see I'm just gambling a lot you know I used the shotgun approach I put a lot of crap out there and eventually I get right. How this is in relation to this game, I can't quite recall What is rather odd though is that we're right now getting triple gases as well as a spire off of three queens and 27 workers Now, I'd like to remind everyone right now that Terran Master, our Zerk player, isn't aware what's going on There is no vision on whether there is a command center a third base has been taken, but technically we're still preparing for a one base all-in. Now, what are some common one-base all-ins? Well, they don't exist because there's no such thing as a one-base all-in in TVZ, but if we were to just think about it with a barracks, a factory and a starboard, we'd be thinking of marine tank pushes with metaphics, we'd be thinking of a Benchy attacks maybe, maybe a battle-cruiser rush as well Literally every single thing that the Terran could have built from one base, This, whatever the heck it is that Terran Master is doing is not good against it Terran Master had the audacity to complain about his opponent's build order, but his own build order is even worse. And you know what they say? If you live in a glass house, you shouldn't be throwing stones at other people, or you shouldn't be throwing stones in general In general, you shouldn't be throwing stones It's a dangerous hobby Also, quite frankly, a rather weird hobby I have a three-year-old domesticated hamster that lives in my basement and sometimes I let him out of his cage and he'll run over my keyboard and touch my mouse and I've seen him produce build orders that make more sense than whatever crap it is that you're showing me here, Terran Masterik, because this build is actual hot garbage It doesn't make sense It's not safe against anything that is from one base. It is not good against anything that would be from two-base it just completely sucks Low eco, really fast stack You're actually super lucky Honestly, you're one of the luckiest people here because aspire is kind of good against this You get like two corruptors and you will be fine forever Now you of course also have the two queens which should be capable of killing these liberators Or you could lose both of the queens But there's still one queen out there Where's that queen? Oh, it's spreading creep That is great I like the priority here of the queen as well, defending this particular creep tumor over making sure that this liberator will not be capable of denying mining for the next five minutes. You gotta be kidding me You literally have a single unit a micro How is this possible? How is this? What are you even looking at? Okay What is this? Someone stomping on your drones? Indeed Okay, look at this You're selecting it? You're looking at this You're walking in the circle, you still have it selected? You still have it selected? This is wonderful This is slow motion view of some of the lowest level decision making that I've seen in my life I knew that people like Terran Master were out there And after two and a half years of doing, is it Imba or do I suck? I finally found one A complete idiot it I've joked before about negative IQ. But Terran Master, if you're out there, I think science would like to study your brain And then, you know, people, scientists always looking for ways to increase people's IQ What they could do with you is they'd look at your brain and then reverse it, basically The complete opposite of what your brain is like, reverse that and we'd get someone with infinite IQ That at least is my theory for now I like the queen that you're building here makes sense You have great success with the last queen that you build as well So I do like that you build another one Taking a Ford gas Yes, that definitely is the priority right now for us Very, very smart. We have two gases that we're not mining from, getting a spore Why are you getting a spire if you're not planning on using it? Like you could have at least built like a corruptor here from this base while it's not being blasted by these liberators You said that every single larva got taken You're building four drones How does this have the priority? Two spores in the natural? How do six drones have the priority over getting two corruptors to deal with the Liberator harass? Ling run by Gets taken out by this mine and then you're a hold positioning here behind the mineral line Some great stuff high level of RAS? I just really don't understand this. It's like I'm watching the first person view of like Alpha Star playing its first training game or something like this It actually blows my mind that there's people like you out there Like, why did you take the Ford Gas? Why did you build a spire if you didn't want to use it? I have so many questions for you I'd like to get in contact for you Could you please send me, an email and just we can talk it out but I'm excited to speak with someone exactly like you I'm just so curious 23 workers, two spores already done This Liberator right now is threatening absolutely nothing. And rather than just sending these drones into the main where there is a spore already, you decide to build another spore with the only, what is it, 70 minerals that you have in your bank You decide to build a spore at this base I also like the persistence of trying to build units from these larva rather than just saying, okay, I'm probably not going to be capable of getting the units from those larva It simply seems to be impossible Now, your opponent actually isn't building anything Your opponent genuinely has a terrible build order, and you are getting absolutely destroyed by this terrible build order I don't think you should be complaining about the fact that your opponent is playing a bad build order. I think you should be grateful that your opponent isn't playing a real build If Penny would have played something remotely similar to a view build, you would have probably lost all 32 workers, send them into like a mine drop, or if there was a single battle cruiser here, you would have two queens and a spore in no man's land Like, this absolute garbage, triple queens on the way once again, because obviously after losing the first four queens, the thing that you really are going to be needing is more queens that you are not going to micro This guy's actually controlling his liberators as well I really do like that Penny is having a blast over here. Does set it up into one of your spores, so at least you will get this liberator The thing that frustrates me the most is that I don't even think you're that slow Yeah, you look quite fast You pull your workers away every single time At least you somewhat pull them away You move the spores around as well It's just like you have no Overlord speed This is actually like watching an AI Plus one! Maybe Maybe Taryn Master is playing some challenge, or not wanting to build any units, but getting the upgrades for them Some beating Grand Master with Stupid Stuff But rather than the series being called Beating Grand Master with Stupid Stuff, it's losing the diamonds. Wait, this is diamond? This is, yeah, this is 3 5K MMR on NA Holy crap, America Get it together Another spore here Another spore The triangle spore location Like the priorities here of what we're spending our money on is crazy It's similar Imagine you're in a post apocodictic world Post-acopolitic world Post, no I was correct the first time I was correct the first time A post-apocalyptic world And you have five post-apocalyptic coins And you go to the post-apocalyptic store And there you get the decision between six cans of beans, food, or one of these plugs that you can, it's like a translator plug, you know? When you go to America or to Canada, you put it in the wall. They can put your European plug in it and it will still work You get electricity Now, usually if you would have, what is I, say, five money or six money and you could buy one of those I'd say that's a relatively good deal if you don't have one of these They're quite useful But you forgot the fact that we're in a post-apocalyptic world and in this world, the six cans of beans are actually going to be way more valuable And it's very similar here Usually I'd say, hey, you know, getting the pneumatized carapace, the ovalor speed and sure, the plus one on the spire is great But right now, this is a situation where your opponent is continuously rallying liberators into your bases. You're on 36 workers The priority should be getting units out to deal with the liberators and then getting drones out to get back your economy The priority is not getting upgrades for air units that you don't even have, getting triple spores in your main base and making your overlords fly faster Like, what is this? I just don't, I don't even understand why you're adding two more here You're already set up Hydra Den You cancel the plus one and go for a Hydra then now This entire game just makes no sense whatsoever to me I don't understand how this is 3 5k MMR I really just do not understand that I used to respect people in Diamond This is very, very low level. I think this is the worst game we've seen He does a creep spread though This Zerk is really bad Starcraft players are worse than this That is so difficult to imagine for me And it hurts a little bit as well This is a relatively old game Okay, this is it No G-G either because obviously the only reason your opponent was because of imbalance I'm not even sure if I can take this imbalance complaint from serious This feels like a setup, like these two guys, the Terran Master and Penny, just set together like let's create the worst game possible, say that it's a different game possible, say that it it's diamond and send it in. I just can't actually believe that this is a real game that got played on the ladder It just seems so unlikely to me I don't really know what to say I don't even really want to make a judgment here, honestly Like, it's obvious to me that liberators are difficult to deal with, especially at lower levels They can be shift queued in, and they can deal a lot of damage You need to put sports in position The queens always walk stupid when you aim of them But you were looking at it every single time You had somewhat correct tools You had a spy already It's like there was no decision making whatsoever in your head And just nothing. I really don't know what to say here You could have literally done anything else and it would have been better I really just don't get it It's just nothing here made sense Like the entire thing, the only thing that would make sense is if you face this build very often on the ladder and you have no clue what to do against it is you use the process of elimination to try and get to the correct answer So imagine we have a difficult mathematical question, a difficult for a Terran master in this case, like two plus seven Now, most people would know that it's nine, but what you could do instead is you could just fix it. in every single answer until whatever you're asking or whatever thing you're putting it in tells you that's correct You start with one, then you get two, then you get three, four, five, six, seven, eight, then you get nine This is what's happening right now, I think, with this game It wouldn't surprise me if from now on I'm going to continuously be getting replay sent to me by Terran Master against this exact build order, which is wildly varying, varying responses So it starts with like this complete crap, four gases, aspire, get plus one, overlord speed, walk my queens into the liberators And then he hears me say, it's like, oh, this is not good Okay, it's not good. Next time he's going to build a hydra then, build four roaches, morph six banlings, and then moonwalk the queens across the map This is the only explanation that makes any sense whatsoever This genuinely was the worst game I think I've seen in this entire series and it's a diamond game and that saddens me You definitely do suck and liberators are not imbalanced I really do not want to receive any more replays either I'm just mainly confused and I'm going to sleep for 18 hours to try and recover from this Thank you That will be it for me and I'll see you all next time Bye-bye Thank you."

        "text": "Dear Harstam, the CIA can't be stopped Charged Lot Immortal Arcon timings Normally, I would not blame balance, as I like to ponder, what would a pro player do? And try to overcome the problems in my play However, this time is different I fought against the same 5 2K Protos player, a friend, on the latter, who went the exact same two-base Charcelot Immortal Arcon, also known as the CIA, A, all in, for all six games we played I lost every single time I know it's coming, but I can't stop it Even when I noticed from the replays and try to exploit the lack of early units in his build, he still managed to barely halt and then overwhelm with the K O. timing attack, despite having lost all his workers at his natural It's ridiculous He gets five immortals, a couple of Harkons, and then eight gate endless char slots with plus one, and he just A-moves at around the seven to eight minute mark Pure Roach Reveager dies Roach Reveager Baines and Links dies And it's not like I can really tack to lurkers that early without leaving gaps in my build order I know my control on these fights aren't great But is that really the only thing that is screwing me over? We're both playing from Asia to the NA server, so there's some lack, question mark Am I getting too many drones? Question mark? Is my unit combat? Question Mark. Is the only way to hold the push to somehow snip the war prism? Question mark How is it that I can have complete knowledge of what is coming, but still not be able to stop it? Question mark I asked him what he thinks I should do, but even he is clueless as to how Zir can beat it He says he copied the build order from Astrea in a game where Solar died to the timing I am frankly at a lost at how to handle this build Please advise me, Captain. Is it Imba or do I suck? I have six replays of me trying out different things against this build. I will just submit the one in which I held the longest with a proxy hatch blocking his Natural to slow this build. (This was written in parentheses at the bottom of the imbalance complaint form.) The person who submitted it is called \"I think race is Zerg\". The league is Master. Is a 4.8k player at the time of writing on the North American Zerg. So that being said, let's hop into the game. Coat in the top right as our red Zerg player with this beautiful Blizzard employee spinning around the Hatchery and in the bottom left we have Leo. A beautiful three letter name I think Leo also means lion I'm not quite sure if that is true, but that's my feeling with the name It's the name of a lion That's for sure This guy is opening up with a Gateway Scout which is extremely enlightened and I like it At the same time we see this this dream this drone move around the map and actually trying to get the block that we were talking about or that the guy was talking about in his imbalance complaint for him So, so far this actually looks good Just straight out of the Bly playbook, a classic third hatchery on the opponent's natural. Now, many people might not be aware of this, but there was a time in StarCraft 2 where this was relatively common and I want to kind of do a throwback there to the Sue games at Intel Extreme Mastres Katowice in I want to say 20, 19 or 2018, I think it was 2019, where every single time against Protos, or at least a lot against Protos, he would open up with three hatch before pool, with the third hatchery not being on his own third base, but on the opponent's third base And because of that, I have quite some experience with this build, at least from the Protos side I know how to respond with it, and I know what's annoying to play again. So as a Protos, the appropriate response tends to be to pull four workers and to Krono boost a Zealot out That way you can take out the hatchery without it finishing and without there being any creep whatsoever on your natural And that is obviously the entire goal The Zerk, if this hatchery goes down anyway, most likely still will be slightly ahead It's a good situation for the Zerk, but only ever so slightly And as the Protols here isn't really pooling a lot of workers, I think here it would be the correct call to actually finish this hatchery That way you can delay the opponent's nexus for a long time A with the creep. And at the very end, because some larva will spawn from the hatchery, you can build overlords from it Ooh, Evo chamber Hatchery cancel into building an Evo chamber is probably a good call if you're being attacked by four or five workers and a zealot, and you can't finish the hatchery with a lot of HP, like with 3,400 HP So I think this was a mistake and it kind of defeats the purpose of the build You're not actually blocking this Nexus for very long with it It is still a reasonably time block and you save a lot of money because you don't finish the hatchery But I actually would have preferred you finishing the hatchery there But this is a minor detail. I still think your opening is fine Your opponent is getting a second gate as well, which is quite frankly terrible for Protos Whenever a second gateway gets built, oh no, never mind There's already tech out I was going to flame him for getting a second gateway before attack But this Protos actually knows how to play the game He lost 5-2 as well, so that makes sense No, this is a proper thing He is slightly supply blocks, so the prism is delayed, and that is bad, obviously We also still see you mining with two workers in gas This is kind of stupid, and this is especially bad because you already invested a lot of minerals into blocking your opponent's hatchery. The moment you're mining gas early in the game, there needs to be a plan with that gas, because gas is a very expensive resource to get I've discussed this many times But the only way for any of the races to gain economy is to spend minerals and to get minerals So more minerals means more economy Queens, overlords, drones, hatcheries, extractors, anything that can create economy requires minerals So the more mineral mining you have in the early game, the better it is for your economy If you want to become more aggressive in the early game or you want to attack quick or get quick upgrades, getting extra gas is very useful But right now you're floating 160 gas, which you don't need at all. Like what are you going to get? A bainling nest? A fast plus one? You want to rush to layer? No, of course not I like the Roach Warren, but you don't need to have 300 gas ready by the time that Roach Warren finishes That is completely useless You can't produce freaking, what is it, 12 roaches at this time in the game You don't even have the minerals for that So the ratio between the gas and the minerals right now is completely off And usually I don't mind that much, but you're a 4 8K player that is high masters You're probably pretty close to Grandmasters, especially on NA You should be aware of how the mineral to gas ratio works at this point. This is kind of sad Now, if we look over at the Protos, we also see that Protos has a lot of gas, but for Protos, this is understandable because the race works differently Often for Protos, you need to initially bank up gas so you can later either use it in centuries if you're going for some type of two-base push or for Templar, Colossi, Disruptor, or later on upgrades You can't as easily just take eight gases at the same time, saturate all of them and get an insane increase in gas income like Zirkan You're also getting a bailing nest after you get the Roche Warren And this actually is a mistake And I'm going to explain this. and I will draw an analogy with moving into a new house So when you leave your parents' house for the first time, when you're maybe 18 or 26 or 35, no matter how old you are, you will be facing the reality of having to buy a set of pans and pots Everyone needs to buy these because you need to cook somehow Now, the Roche Warren is kind of the five or seven pans and pot sets that you can get at the IKEA Okay, it's a very useful thing to have You're not a great cook most likely So they will absolutely suffice Like this is your primitive, your primitive pots and pans, nothing too fancy It's the same in Stargerton. The Roach Warren, it helps you defend against most things extremely well The Bealing Nest is more like an air friar It is a very specialized tool that should never be your priority And if you have limited funds, like you do right now, as you're only on 41 workers, you can't afford an air friar at this point You can't afford this bailing nest We should be sticking to our IKEA set of seven pots and pans You know, you get your sauce pan, maybe two frying pans, and then two of these pans with the pots with the lids on it You can boil your potatoes in it or make some nice soup This air friar is way out of your budget at this point. On top of that, you're also taking a second gas, which is kind of understandable if you're getting a bailing nest, because you obviously want to be spending the gas, but you shouldn't be getting the Bainting Nest, and thus you probably also should not be getting this gas quite yet You want to be getting this gas as late as possible to once again increase your mineral income for as long as you can Another mistake that you're making right now at this point is that you don't have a ling over here, scouting for anything. So you are extremely aware that your opponent does not have a third base, although I wouldn't mind if you scout around a little bit to make sure there's no proxy base, but you are not quite quite sure if your opponent is moving out or not So that means that you're forced into building units that you don't need whatsoever Your opponent isn't moving out The beauty of Zerk is that you can respond to what you see You don't have to blindly do things You literally always have map control either with over Where's your Overlord by the way? It's not there I guess it got taken out by the prison maybe Prison and a stalker Perhaps. Anyway, with links, you can also see a move out happening By the time the Protos leaves here, you have about like, what, 35 to 40 seconds before this slow, sluggish army makes it way to this position or to disposition Plenty of time to get roaches out to morph ravagers to morph baines Morping revergers and baines ahead of time is completely nonsensical There's no point The morph time of these units is so low that if you have a scout here, you will always be able to get these units out in time So these are resources that you're investing into something that you cannot be using yet it just makes absolutely zero sense Like you're just wasting money You could either be getting more drones. You could be getting more queens If you're not sure what's happening as a Zerk player, but you want to be safe, what you can do is you can build drones and queens And if you already have like seven to eight roaches like you do in this case, that's great because then the moment you see your opponent move out, you just morph your roaches into Reviters You start unit production You have the maximum amount of drone drones that you can have and you have a creptone of queens, which are great at, well, everything really Defense, offense, spreading creep, transfusing, keeping yourself alive, killing air units, killing ground units, tanking against ground units, tanking against air units. They can inject, so provide more larva as well They look pretty cool And you have to do massive things on their head Like five arms or something like that They could really beat you up in a fight I'd like to see the queen against Floyd Mayweather And when I'm talking about the queen, I'm not talking about the old British lady, because I think Floyd Mayweather would definitely have that But, you know, this queen, the desert queen I don't think Floyd Mayweather would be having such a good time, especially if there's a couple of carapace upgrades on this Take a couple of hits So now this army moves out And this is when you should be building you. So you probably should be, you asked, did I build too many drones? And I think the answer is no You didn't build too many drones maybe you even build too little drones, but most importantly, you build the drones that you built too late because you were too focused on building banlings, roaches, mainly banlings and ravagers, and other things that you didn't really need at that point in time yet, which you could have known if you just had scouted So your opponent starts moving out I actually do believe you have a fairly good defense setup, honestly Like, despite the banling nest being a luxury earlier in the game, seven minutes in on 60 workers Yeah, I think getting a couple of banlings is fine. Now, I do have to admit that getting 25 banlings against a push like this is a bit much The banling is one of these units where it doesn't really matter whether, especially if you're trying to kill zealids It doesn't matter so much if you have 10 or 35 in this case, because you're most likely going to be capable of blowing up the zealots and you won't be capable of blowing up the arcons You can only blow up the arcons if you have such a huge eco lead that you can afford throwing 40 banlings into an army and then everything explodes at the same time But if you can't clear an arcon, then, well, there's no point in getting more than 10 banlings maybe. So a lot of these banlings are kind of wasted defensive units It could have been more revergers This is a pretty decently sized error, and I'm going to be kind of nitpicky here because, well, let's face it, you're supposed to be pretty good 4 8K MMR You see your opponent move on your creep You have a position with Ravagers and with Bainlings One of the many strengths of the Ravager, and the Ravager really does have very many strength, is the fact that you can hold ramps extremely easily The Bial is a great zoning tool, probably about as good as the force field or a storm on us Well, okay, storm is better. I take the part about the storm back, but it is a freaking good zoning tool You can keep this ramp for a little bit, and time is on your side, you know there's no third base yet You're up about 20 workers You're outmining your opponent by 700 minerals a minute That equals about like five spine crawlers, I guess, if you include the cost of the drone as well So every minute that you stay alive, you can add five spine crawlers into this army or into this defense while keeping the same army production as your opponent Just put that in your mind and think how crazy that is. In two minutes from now, you'll have 10 extra spine crawlers and there's no way this pathetic little army is ever going to be breaking through Back into the game So you should have held this ramp And also these banlings, the moment these zealids walk up, like the complete idiots, like they are in this case, the zealids should die immediately They kind of do die immediately Your roaches and rafters are kind of behind Your queens aren't tanking And you throw away all of your banlings Okay This was a bad fight, but yet you're in a good situation situation I'm going to explain to you why this actually was a bad fight rather than just calling it a bad fight. It's always interesting to know the reasons why Like I mentioned before, the use of the bainling here is to blow up the zealot Once you're done with blowing up the zealots, you can save these bainlings Let's go back to our air fryer analogy here Imagine you want to fry fish sticks in your air fryer Okay? So you fry these fish sticks in your air fryer You eat the fish sticks in the air fryer You will still keep the air fryer because it is still working You will not throw it out saying, well, I ate the fish sticks today I have nothing to put in my air fryer currently And thus, I will throw my air friar in the trash. And it's the same with the banlings You wouldn't do that with an air fryer You wouldn't do it with the banlings Your banlings are still in perfectly fine condition You can just send them over here Save them for the next Zellet Warbin, which you know inevitably is going to come Bainlings are your tool at defending the zealots, your roaches and ravagers and your queens, are the two at defending absolutely everything else The Aracons, the sentries, the immortals, but just the zealots, it's really nice to have banlings against these Throwing them into this army, look at this You're barely even doing any damage through this immortals because you're busting through the barrier There's really no point. Now, these immortals with plus one, absolutely ripping to through your roaches as well, of course, at this point And with the zealids tanking, none of these units are really dying either I still think this is a very playable position for you I actually believe you're kind of ahead Getting the bailing speed upgrade at this point is interesting and I think a mistake I much rather have roach speed, which would make kiting easier, rather than bainling speed Look, your bainlings are going to be exploding on top of the zalids you're not trying to catch high Templar with a flank from the back It's really not that difficult Save the gas that you're investing here and put it into more revergers instead. Put it into Roach speed Hell, get more queens, although those don't cost gas You also spend some minerals here You're floating a crap ton of money You could be building three queens at a time and pull all of This is a brilliant trick that especially lower-level Zerg players, and I'm just going to say it, a 4.8K Zerg player apparently also isn't aware of this yet If you're in trouble, you can pull all your active queens that are currently injecting hatcheries You inject once with them, then you pull them downstairs and you just build new queens And that's completely fine And you can repeat this trick over and over again And your queen count will continue to grow forever. And you will hardly miss any inject I think you'll miss like, what, 10, 12 seconds or so of an inject round But because you're spending money on queens is most likely fine Here, once again, the zealids move forward This time your bailings are stuck behind this massive, fat, piece of royalty Links stuck behind your roach army as well So the zealots tanked a lot of the initial shots And I don't think your transfuses were too hot either They will actually need to kind of take it a little bit slower here So if we count the amount of transfuses available, we see what? There's three over here There's four here There's two here There's zero here Four plus two plus three. Every time I do mad hamster makes fun of me I think this is third I think we have 13 transfuses 4, 4, 2, 3 Yeah Let's count how many you actually use So this one died without using a single one That was 4 So out of the 13, we're already missing 4 This one dies with 3 So we're now missing 7 I think I just saw a transfuse be used here That's 1 That's 2 That's 2 2 I think 2 or 3 transfuses It's difficult to count There could have been a lot more health here on these queens or on the roaches if you want to heal those, of course. You could even be transfusing links if you really want to if you're such a tryhard Still floating a decent chunk of money as well Might want to just spend it on getting a couple of drones at this point It's probably worth it Evo chamber If you're building an Evo chamber, you're really investing in the far future I wouldn't mind if you just use it to block units, but actually to get upgrades in your main base Like that's two minutes away from now I think you can spend that money more wisely But at the same time, you're floating so much that maybe it's fine Getting nine more banlings I kind of like getting some banlings I wouldn't mind seeing some more revereters. Once again, you're not really guarding the ramp ever either, which I think is one of the biggest mistakes that you've made so far this game Oh, now we see the bainling speeds So they will be useless at high speed Look at that It's like driving a Porsche into a wall At least it was fast Very nice yeah, at this point you're dead I mean, you have nothing left His entire army, I mean, he's five immortals He's going to bless every single roach that you have And this is basically just because you fight like a bit of a clown There's really not too much to say about this Your early game wasn't very tight either. Yeah, I mean, you stay in for a long time as on This is a massive copium here out of you Gigi, at least you do Gigi Then you leave the game Wow Leo wins What actually was it that you completely? about exactly So you weren't sure what to do That was the main thing What would a pro player do? And then you bring up that Austria beats solar with it in one game Now, this is one of these things that absolutely pisses me off Pro players lose all the time to certain strategies Okay. I could, with this type of logic, I could pick one build where clam beats a player and we're like, look, even another pro player couldn't hold clams, whatever, eBay block into Tourex pressure which isn't a very good build, but just because Klam won with it, then all of a sudden that's an argument I don't think that is quite how it works, and I don't think it's quite how it's supposed to work So that's an argument that I immediately will just say, I ain't buying it What else was there? How is it that I can have complete knowledge of what is coming, but still not be able to stop it? See like this. Imagine you're boxing against Floyd Mayweather, okay? And he says, I'm going to punch the rights side of your head, which is this side of my head It took a little longer than should have And then if you put up your arm on the left side like this, I'm not sure how you're supposed to defend your head in boxing I never did boxing And he punches your right side And then you go, I knew exactly what was happening I had full knowledge Yet you knocked me out in one hit How is that fair? He just laugh at you and probably walk away Because it's kind of an idiotic thing to do You had complete knowledge of what was happening, except you didn't really. know the moveout timing, I guess But you just didn't respond properly You took your gases way too early You built units way too early You could have built way more drones earlier, getting more money initially, and then later on start producing units Your queen count was too little You didn't use the transfuses You didn't use the ramp control that you had with the ravagers and roaches as well So there's lots of things that you were lacking The spines were in a truly terrible position. If you can have spines attacking the moment units come onto a ramp, that is a fantastic thing because then the protels is naturally forced to either stutter step forward to kill the spines moving into your banlings as well or the protels is forced to stand in a small concave on the ramp where not everyone can shoot and the immortals will kind of start dancing you know kind of behind one another which altogether is just a bad situation so honestly I don't even think you play too bad like some of the things you did were good I mean you built units and you realized it wasn't Al-in, but then at the same time, your micro, your army composition, your build-up, your scouting of when the move-out was, yeah, it just all sucked. And if you're playing against a well-timed all-in, which this was, someone that follows a build order properly, and you don't defend properly, you make six, seven defense in the defensive execution, that is on you That is not imbalanced That is how the game is supposed to function If you don't know when an all-in is going to hit and you don't defend properly when you do finally get the knowledge, yeah, you're supposed to die That's not in balance, my friend That is just you Sucking And that's going to be my verdict for today And you have to do with that Thanks all so much for watching.

        "text": "Hello Harsdom Zerk is completely overpowered In this game I made no mistake and still lost The Zerk just spammed links and veins in my bases, which did no damage, but behind that he just creeped the entire map and tacked to Hive and then I couldn't play the game anymore There is nothing Taryn can do if the Zerk has a brain With two control groups of Ling Bain Bollocks armies, Taryn can never take a fourth I tried to hold on with Ghost and then in parentheses behind it it says micro unit But then he amof me with Bainlicks and in parentheses an A move unit The Bainling is really imbalanced and always gains too much value for its cost I'm really curious. What can Terran do to beat this? Was there anything I could have done better? Or is Taryn just a non-viable race? I'm pretty sure I don't suck So the question here is going to be Charazard, Terran player in Masters with 4 6K MMR on EU Is it Inba or do you suck? And that leads us to this game here on Burlingrad between Chawazard, basically Chirazard but then misspelled, or perhaps the French pronunciation of Charizard, Chorazard, the beak flying orange Pokemon And a Sisyphus here on the bottom bottom right, a red Zirk player Now, Perling Red is a Terran favorite map I think most people would agree on that It is relatively short There is a creptone of little chokes. There is a ramp leading up towards your fifth base, which makes it difficult for the Zerk to take it You need good creep there and creeping up ramps tends to be difficult There's a nice little ramp up here, which gives good positions for tanks There are tank positions in this area There's tank positions in the bushes You can push through the middle, remove these double mineral patches, which only have five minerals each You have tank positions over here on the high ground The first four bases for Taryn are practically free And that is something that's interesting, actually In his imbalance complaint form, Chauazar, complained about the inability to take a fort base because of two groups of Ling Bain. Now, Ling Bain of Creep is one of these units that just doesn't function very well The link functions well Off creep I'm not going to lie about that It's extremely high speed It can run away, it can run, it can deal damage The banling, however, falls off a freaking cliff, the amount of damages deals on creep compared to off creep Off creep banlings generally just don't perform very well unless they initially have creep to catch up with the Terran army This is just a fact Banlings on creep are like twice as valuable as of creep. Another interesting complaint that Chauroix had over here is that he said that the beelings, I'm going to need to see it again here for one more second, just to make sure that I didn't, yeah, yeah, no, I read it correctly It always gains too much value for its cost, which I thought was a very interesting thing because the bailing is one of the units that almost always trades inefficiently, almost always Because it is, honestly, a relatively expensive unit You need to morph it from a Zirklin For a basic unit that most of the time can't trade one for one Yeah, it is quite an expensive unit Also because it costs gas, of course. If you compare to like a zealot or a marine, these units do not cost gas and they trade quite well as well Another thing that our Terran player mentioned was the fact that you don't need the micro-bane links and the fact that you need the micro-terran units Now, if we get to those situations, we can of course compare the micro that is being executed and compare the micro that is being required in these scenarios But I do believe that the terran might have a point there, especially on Kareep, baylings view, like they don't need quite as much micro oftentimes So I have to wait and see what's going to happen there. Reaper goes in for a scout, checks the gas, good play by the way Both of their build orders are just Good It's the beauty I think of StarCraft is that around that master level, midmasters, high masters, even low masters, you really start seeing tighter build orders, good strategic concepts, that type of stuff It's fun to see It's really fun StarCraft in my opinion More mistakes than on the higher levels, obviously, but it also tends to make the games a little more dynamic Combacks are a lot more likely, for example, which always fun to see At least, for me And it's relatively easy to still spot mistakes as well in both players. Now, Depot while on the low ground starts here with the third depot Zirk can scout that And as a result, know that it's not a fast triple-CC opener Because with a fast triple-c-c-op, rather than relying on your depot, you rely on your third command center to finish up to get out of the 46 out of 46 supply block that you otherwise would run into So this is a pretty big deal If you're a Zerk player and you see that third supply depot, you know that it's not going to be a single gas triple-cccc It's not possible Well, it's possible, but it's an extremely ineffective build So no point in playing that if you're Taryn Here come the four Hellions. We see four queens already moving towards the front The question now is going to be, will we see a queen split? Or are we going to move these four queens to the Helion location each time? Nice, overlord spread as well, look at that This air player really figured out the correct timings Seas that there's no second starboard unit on the way either, which is good And knows that there's a Liberator on the way right now as well Now if it's just a Liberator, I think with pure queen, you can be fine, or you can get some spores We see one Okay, so one spore in the main, one spore in the natural I like that. Most of the time, you're going to have majority of your queens at your third base anywhere, so you don't really need a sport over there Spore is going to finish a couple of seconds too late, but yeah, Liberator should not be possible of dealing too much damage here Siege is up, and this is in range of a spore Now, this is the type of move that Terrans often make, and I don't quite understand it, especially because I believe I saw that Charoixix Terrembler was looking at that Liberator and was looking at that Spore as well So here we go, we send it in. We see the Spore building, and then now we still need to make the decision whether to set it up inside of Spore Range or outside of Spore Range And this obviously is a rather debatable call why would you not just put it slightly further over here? Like you're still vulnerable to queens from the top side and now you're also in range of the sport I don't understand this I really do not You're going to unsege as well, which I guess is fine if you think you could have tried and save it You couldn't, but maybe you didn't know So yeah, that's a pretty big mistake. And the reason I mentioned this is because you did open up with a delayed third command center for faster initial helions for a faster starboard unit as well If you cut economy in order to get things out faster, you need to deal some damage with it And so far, you've only killed two workers, but you also lost the liberator of your own So resource lost wise, you're actually behind This is not a good look You've also only killed a single creep tumor and the creep, quite frankly, is booming It's booming business to be in the creep department here over in the Sisyphos, his company, if you will Double evil on the way, extra barracks coming down. This was a six helion opener, I think It's not a single helion has gone down Six helion openers are, well, I think, supposed to hit slightly faster than you're hitting right now Maybe 10, 15 seconds delayed is what you are at this point Not the biggest of deals and understandable, because you're not an absolute top pro your opponent is actually playing some really good StarCraft Like the Queen movement is almost consistently mirroring the Hellions, which is what you want The creepspread is being pushed out further and further There's five bases on the way There's even a macro hatch coming down in the natural or in the third base. I am not a huge fan of this position because it can create a bit of a choke for Lings and Banelings if the Terran manages to siege up over here or siege up over here Much rather would have it in this type of position in the main base maybe even in this general spot Also possible, of course, then you run the risk If there's a couple of tanks over here, that you have the same thing happening here with creating some type of natural choke for your Lings and Banelings to move through But I'm not a huge fan of this position But macro hatch is fine. I really like it when players recognize the fact, hey, I have trouble spending my money in this matchup Let me just get a macro hatchery That way I can spend my money rather than floating five, 600 minerals the entire way through This increases my product and is a good thing Fort and fifth base being taken at the same time also is quite standard Ling run by is already being set out on the map as well And the creep spread here at seven minutes is It's honestly fantastic I am very impressed by the Zerkes play so far Worker count at 75, bainling speed is on the way, 1-1 on the way We have a run-by setup We have creep being spread. We have the appropriate amount of bases Money is being spent Bainlings are being morphed in time We have five balings here and moving on in the top side as well, going in for a run-by And here comes the first push-out Now, this should be capable of clearing at least a little bit of creep, so we should see a scan here, I think, to take out the creep And maybe with some good target fire, you could also take out some other things We're going to move into the first point Ooh, here we go Okay, banings move in, we saw it Immediately transfers the workers very quick response here out of Chawazar. And that is exactly what we want as well in this type of situation So that is perfect so far, you haven't really made any major mistakes I'm sure your initial push was a little bit delayed, but you responded to everything in time You haven't lost any halions yet You've only lost that Liberator But, this is the butt You haven't dealt any damage either And you opened up with a two-base opener with six heli-shallion Sorry, yeah, yeah, delayed third command center, so basically a two-base opener into six heliens and a single Starport unit, Fast Marines, and so far, you have killed nothing You've killed three banlings and two links That this is not good enough. If you are investing heavily into your early game, you need to do something with your early game, otherwise you're just going to end up behind And that is just what happened there And it feels like you haven't made any mistakes, and you really haven't made any large mistakes where you mess up, where you walk your entire army into base links, but that doesn't matter Right now, at this level, at Masters, you also need to do something Not messing up isn't good enough anymore You also actually need to create good moves And I think this is something you're not quite understanding because you're like, okay, well, if I just sit at home and I don't make any mistakes, life seems pretty okay for me. And I mean, sure, this is fine, but you're going to have a good time against this type of run by as well, most likely But you're giving the opponent so much space and the one thing you can do against Zirk is giving the opponent space Because if you give your opponent space, the creep is going to continue spreading The drone count can continue rising Investation pit will get thrown down There will be quick HiveTag Tech, Hydra, then More banings will be created as well And it will be really easy for Sirk to set up any potential run by Stoo. Now, on top of this, the fact that you're not dealing any damage, wouldn't even have been so bad had you build a really fast fort base and decided to kind of just bunker down on four bases and go up to higher tech yourself But the way that you're playing this is almost with a semi three base all in Like you're building a lot of units, a very late fort base here at the nine minute mark only while floating one K minerals by the way But you're not dealing any damage. So once again, it feels like if I look at your army and at the state of the game, It feels like you want to be aggressive, but then instead of being aggressive, you just sit at home the entire time This is the first real creep tumor denial that we're seeing in this game And you get pushed back immediately because your opponent, well, it's pretty easy to respond to only a single threat on the map at a time And that's what you're doing You're sending three meta vaccines in like, oh, that didn't work Then we just go back home Now, Ling Runby goes in Luckily, you still have 10 Marines idling in your main base. You also have 10 Marines idling in your natural for whatever reason It's another Ling Bain run-by gets sent in And look, I'm completely agreeing with you These Ling and Ling Bain run-bys or whatever it is aren't really paying off in a big way for the Zirk, but they also don't really need to The Zerk is alive, the creep is expanding, extra bases are being taken, and he is stacking into a higher tier right now with that hive We're going to see an Ultralist Cavern being built as well So the Zerk is basically setting up for a late game you're still, well, trying to get your 4th Command Center build Like, this is not an even game anymore whatsoever. Your opponent is already starting a bank and you, well, you're not You're not even maxed yet Don't have, do you even have your extra barracks on the way? You're still on five barracks at this point in the game This is a painful run by for the Zerk once again, really not dealing too much damage But even this type of trade, I think, is fine If you have this much map control, you can just kind of trade some units away We see the overall resources lost app is actually relatively close And that was the thing that I found really funny in your imbalance complaint form, of course, is that you mentioned that the bailing has way too much value. And I think the bailing, it almost always trades cost inefficiently, but because Zirk usually has more money, that is okay And that is the case here, except this time around, Zerk actually is training somewhat well as well taking a seventh base, I think this is, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven before you even have your fourth base landed I mean, you're just sitting here and doing nothing I actually, I think this is the issue with you This, this is what the issue is Listen to this A good way to look at it is to kind of think of StarCraft 2 and compare it to the 100 meter dash. Okay? So if we would have the Starcraft 2 Leagues, you have your bronze players, these would be the people at the 100 meter dash that would show up after the race So often just showing up in the Bronze League is enough to get your win Then you have your silver players These are the people that spend the entirety of the foot race complaining about how loud the starting pistol was They might get lost on the way to the finish and all of that good jazz You have your gold people Now, these are the first people that start moving in the correct direction They know generally where the finish line is located and most of the time they will get there. Okay, but at this point you don't have to put in too much effort yet to win We're moving up to the Platinum League Now, these people are, it's starting to look like running Most people have stopped crawling at this point Some are walking at a higher speed even So, you know, it's starting to look a little bit like sprinting at this point Then we hit Diamond and here I think most people will be wearing shoes already The speed is picking up But you, my friend, are in none of these leagues You've passed these already You've passed the bar of each of these individual leagues You now are in Masters and here people show up in time They wear their shoes. They know the rules of the game And it's the same in StarCraft too Just showing up, sitting back and waiting for your opponent to mess up massively It's just not going to happen that much anymore You need to force mistakes out of your opponent, and you're not doing that Sure, you're not making that many mistakes yourself Delayed Ford base, your initial liberator is a bit so-so But the real issue is you are not forcing any mistakes whatsoever out of your opponent, while your opponent is trying its best to make you mess up by sending in Ling runbyes, by keeping pressure on you, all the while expanding behind it and creeping the entire map. So usually in your diamond league or in your gold leak, you'd have one of these three things happening, right? So either the opponent is expanding or they're creeping or they're attacking But at this level, all three things are happening at the same time And you are doing nothing There's no pressure on the opponent You're not denying any creep whatsoever and you're not even expanding that fast So you just do every single thing that your opponent is doing You're just doing it way less successful And that is why you're so far behind right now in this game is your opponent has a completely free game He's not being obstructed whatsoever. And you're just going to finish, well, if it was a 100 meter dash, five, six seconds later than your opponent And let me tell you, 100 meter dash, five, six seconds is a lot I know It really is a lot It feels like a lifetime if you're the guy that is six seconds late You once had to run these things for high school And we had one kid that used to run for fun, you know, in his free time as well It was actually ridiculous and it was depressing to have to run against him So I can kind of feel what you're feeling in this game And so, you know, I understand that this isn't fun. And you set up for a fort base, you absolutely blast it Like, he was ready to pounce on this This Zirks game plan is just a pounce on your fort base when you try to take it to trade somewhat inefficiently, but it doesn't matter because he's outmining you in such a big way This is even still pretty good trades, honestly, for a Zerk. like Zirk has a difficult time trading well they really really do you added your extra barracks and you're adding a fifth command center as well at this point but you're still not really putting in any look at this adding liberators at this one you're just completely turtling up and I'm all for turtling up if it's a bad situation but if you're turtling up you'll need a faster forward base you need to take a faster fifth as well in order to get that eco you can turtle up on bad eco, because then your opponent can continuously throw units at you, trade poorly and still win And that's honestly kind of what's happening here You pick up your units, interesting call. Every single tank is going to get taken out as well There's a lot of tanks in this army though I also find it kind of funny that you were talking about micro while literally the only micro you do is just running away from units It's not like you're splitting and trying to maximize your damage output out of your Marines I take a look at that last fight here Like, this is not a terran army that is, you know, splitting into little chokes and trying to find ways to maximize the marine output At this point, you're literally just running You shoot like twice and that's it But there's no splits, nothing moving behind the wall, nothing to the side. You're not forcing banlings to explode onto single or, you know, double marines Like, you're just literally running your entire chunk And every now and again a bainling hits and you lose like, well, what is it? 5, 6, 10 supply Resources lost is actually even So saying that the bailing has, you know, it kills too much for what it costs, too much value for its cost It's not actually true All that, you lose your command center as well This has just been a terrible sequence of events At the same time, your opponent has the creep in your face You have taken out 20 creep tumors in total in a 13-minute game, and like I said, this would be fine in. In the diamond league, this would be fine, in the platinum or gold, silver or bronze But in this league, that is not okay anymore because right now there's 86 creep tumors on the map already And I don't think that number is going to get lower anytime soon Your opponent also figured out that you can just continuously be building more and more banlings to just burst this position As long as you don't have a fort base, there's no real reason to panic because, well, he's taking his eighth base Oh, and I love this move, by the way Look at that Taking the base closer to the Tarrant to try and mine it faster Sisyphos. Sisyphos has a real game plan and is also using it relatively well So it just forces another lift-off, make sure that no planetary can be built here It's not a super efficient trait, but it doesn't really matter Good run-bys as well Even saving these units? Man, this is better than the average Protos controls their Zellad run-bys Average Pro-Los on the pro level The safety pretty cool Almost feels like this Sisyphus is in like a different league I don't know to say he's smurfing, but he's definitely outclassing you That's how bad this looks, is that I'm considering this smurfing He's really just playing a fabulous game at this point I'm not even quite sure why you're still in the game. Like, you've lost at this point, but you're still holding on to your rules from back in the day You know, as long as I don't die, I still have a chance my opponent is going to attack into me at some point and will completely ruin it because everyone else is idiot and I'm smart and I can defend everything And actually your opponent does attack into you But look at that Look at the amount of constraint that this Zirk is using It would be so easy here Imagine being this Zerk I'd feel like the Zerk here would have more of a justification to write an imbalance complaint for him. Like, hey, how is it possible that Terran, after doing absolutely nothing all game, not being capable of landing a fort base while I'm taking my 8th on his side of the map, having the entire map covered in creep How is it possible that I'm not capable of killing my opponent yet? Why does this guy believe at this level that he should stay in? Like, isn't that imbalance the fact that Terrans believe that they can win a game like this? That is the real imbalance And I'd be a lot more sympathetic with that type of complaint because that does feel a little bit ridiculous Oh my God How is this even possible? This is off creep, you have tanks behind you. How do you lose 12 marines to six Banelings while fighting with your entire army against like one third of your opponent's army? Honestly, the Zerg has been controlling the last two fights a little bit less well, but still is in a completely fine position. Now the Terran finally gets a planetary up, still a base in the main base, and hasn't been morphed into anything, could turn into an orbital, could turn into a planetary as well. So a couple of creep tumors getting denied right now You're not sending out a single drop You're not sending out, well, basically, you could also maybe just nuke something Just any type of pressure to the opponent would be huge. Ling run by on the right side. I just love this Just setting in a single and checking, hey, can I attack over here? No, I can't Can I attack on the left side? No, I can't This is a ninth base being taken right now So we're currently working nine base against, well, three, because this base isn't even there anymore 87 workers, greater spire on the way, borough, range Literally everything is being built at this point More ultras as well And yet you're still staying in the game You actually still are staying in the game Six mines, 13 ghosts, six marauders I think your army, honestly, isn't even that bad. And if you can survive on an army like this and you would have had maybe four, four or five extra command centers and your opponent wouldn't have the entire mapping creep and this base wouldn't be here and this base wouldn't be here and your opponent wasn't maxed and wouldn't have 2 5k minerals in the bank you probably still would have a chance so I'm trying to say is that if your opponent would go afk in the next three minutes you destroy his army entirely while your opponent is afk I think it would be about even and we'd have a real fighting chance This could potentially be a good fight Ooh, good splits there on the Bains, man Why does. I want to see those splits again Planetary gets taken out Look at these Bain splits Look at this One, two Hoo, who, who, who, who Poof! Four directions, baby Four directions This Zerk split more in this one fight than this Taryn has split in the entire game The only micro that I have, seen out of the Terran so far is running away and that is not micro That is however my strategy if I ever get into a street fight And then if I have to file a police report after I'll say that I outmicrode my opponent as well Sir, you say you out microed your opponent? Could you define that? Well, I ran at full speed I learned that from Shahwazar. I probably get kicked out of the police station But yeah, this is actually kind of funny that you talk about Ghost being a micro unit and I see you Look at this Look at this I can remove everything here Everything is selected in a single control group Look at this Is the mine in there as well? Yep, mine is in there as well Metavex, mine, ghost, Marine Marauder, a very diverse army that requires separate control But you put everything in one group and then just run it back anyway. If you were to put everything in one group so it makes it easier for you to split, I would understand that, but you move this group as one unit and just micro it away from the fight So, yeah, a little bit debatable to call your opponent out on not micro-ing Well, I've actually seen some pretty decent splits, dodging mines, in general, just calling the fights correctly what needs to be done Don't forget that when Zirk engages into a fight with their army, they don't know what's behind it And that is often the scary part as a Zirk player in this matchup You don't know if there's five tanks or seven mines up there still It's just a really, really scary thing. Trigger some of these mines Here we go with another fight Planetarium on the left side must have been taken out like three times as well at this point A couple of these links and bains being sent in ahead of the army trying to clear lines of mines Just like the mine defense We get a pretty decent job at that Honestly, I think the control of the Zerk is actually quite good I also think the macro of the Zerk is quite good This area is, what, on 10 bases now or so? This base being built Yeah, that's going to be the 10th base So it's 10 base against 4 And the entire map is covered in creep And look at these ghosts. They're going to get taken out No splits, no splits Still running, still running, still running Evens, look, look this Splitting off these bailings towards the bottom side here to make sure that not everything gets caught by mines, anticipating what's going to happen in the future Freaking Nostradamus over here with the calls, man This is fantastic There's no way the Zurich is this level He's just completely out playing Chorazar in this game It's actually insane Chirrazar, by the way, still staying in the game, despite, you know, not bothered by the fact that he is down Well, actually, let's count the mining bases at this point We'll count this as not a mining base and we'll count this as half a mining base. So that is half a mining base against, well, one, well, two, But potentially, actually every single base on the map right now could potentially still be mining And a lot of them are mining It's like literally six base mining or so And it has been like this for a long time Overall, the resources lost that, by the way The one thing that the Terran complained about was the cost of the bailing The cost compared to the value of the bailing This is the one thing he complained about And this is the one thing he actually is ahead in Is in the units lost Our Terran player lost less units, at least resource-wise, than the Zerk. And also probably in actual unit numbers, because links are very small and only have supply Now, this probably is, well, once again, the final fight I feel like I've been looking at final fights for the past 10 minutes already, and just waiting for Charozar to also realize that it's the final fight My friend, the troops No, Gigi Okay, I dig it So it actually was the final fight this time Leaves without a G Sends in an imbalance complaint form, complaining about banlings being an AMOVE unit while continuously moving away with ghost This is an unbelievable imbalance complaint form. The question on there was, I'm really curious, what can Taryn do to beat this? Now, what can Taryn do to beat this? It's a relatively long list So, first of all, if you open up with an aggressive opener, you invest into your aggression, you need to deal damage with that Or you need to force so many units and in that way inflicts inflicts some type of indirect damage Otherwise, if you're incapable of dealing damage in the early game, you're not good with the harassment, play triple cc builds Double Benchy, eight helion, um, four helion into a two and one type of deal with a fast third cc These builds, you don't have to be. have to deal as much damage with in the early game because you have a very fast 30-C yourself, you're going to be able to also get a quick 4th CC with that, and then you can really turtle up on these four bases If that is your play style, you should be switching up your build order If your play styles to be really aggressive, your opener and your follow-up make some sense But if you don't know how to use Halleons aggressively and your plan is to sit back and do nothing, then sit back and do nothing, but do it on a better economy as well What else is there that Terran can do to beat this? Well, you could consider splitting your units. You could consider getting mines a little bit faster as well Sensor towers are good to know where the army is coming from Do I actually need to continue going on? Targeting with your mines could be useful as well Targeting with your tanks I haven't really seen that either Most of the time the tanks were just shooting at links rather than at baylings Like there's literally an infinite amount of things that you could have known better You could every now and then move on the map to try and deny some active creep tumors I actually think that literally everything that Terran can do could have been done better in this game You did nothing even remotely close to a high level. And your opponent was actually of a high level You played against an opponent that knew how to tie his shoelaces, that knew how to run He ran fast He finished that 100 meter dash in 10 seconds And you, my friend, you got lost midway through and still looking for the finish line that is an issue That is nothing to do with Taryn That is nothing to do with Zerk No, my friend, you just suck That's the hard, hard reality All right That's going to be it for me today.

        "text": "Dear Harsdom, Taryn is just broken They can just do whatever they want with no consequence Buildings that can be repaired and defend themselves Early pressure with eco behind No SUVs? No worries Just drop mules But the worst thing about Taryn are cyclones and widow mines Just so easy to abuse both Cyclones outrange everything and can just kite you for days back into the widow mine lines There is nothing I could do I tried sentries to keep them close to me It is impossible to land force fields Cyclones are too fast In this game, I defended the early game pressure very well Suffered no worker casualties and then went and killed a bunch of SCVs, but the Terran didn't care. I scouted his hidden third base, but he just came and kept sniping my third and fourth bases Every time it was impossible for me to take a good fight He would just run away and scan, so I would keep taking damage I felt like my hands were tight This made me very upset Please capitam This unit just feels like it allows for no counterplay The Terran had such bad eco, but could hold of everything I had To me, it seems like the real question isn't if I suck, but who would win? 16 roly boys? Or aliens with technology so advanced we can't even imagine it? I think we already know the answer, though I think we do. I just love that he said, this made me very obvious upset It's such a statement, you know, a strong statement, but it feels like there's no real emotion This made me very upset And then his name is Wolfie, and he has in parentheses behind it, Wolfie Ra, shout out to my boy White Ra Now look, I'm all for, you know, having fun whenever we can, but this is a serious form that you have to fill in in order for me to read it, and you decide to give a shout out to your boy, White Ra Do you also do you also do? this when you're applying for a job. And on your resume, your name is Alexander, and then you do a shoutout to King Alexander the 4th or something like that It's just a really weird thing to do This is not the place nor the time to make a shout out on your name, on this very serious form So please refrain from doing this in the future You will just not be picked ever again See this as a warning for everyone Anyway, the race is Protos, the leak is diamond, the server is an A, and the MMR is 30200 So, my friends, is it Inba? Or does he suck? And in order to investigate that claim, we're here on Burlingrad, Wolfira versus our barcode Terran player, 3. 2K diamond game from North America Now, I would like to mention one more thing here, Wolfyra Also, if you have to explain, like everyone that sees Wolfhira and it is aware of who Wydra is, will know what it is you don't have to explain that anymore It's a little bit like having to explain a joke or a pun You know, if you go like, if you were a fruit, you'd be a fine apple And then if no one laughs at it, then you go into responding, you see, well, I think you're fine And a pineapple sounds like fine apple And I said if you were a fruit. And then people find you even weirder than before you made the fine apple joke, because puns generally are not very funny And it's the same with if you have a shout-up and the shout-out is technically already in your name You don't have to do it again It's kind of You kind of double it in that case This is also impressive reaction time, I have to admit, by you I always like to, you know, just go over the time you have from danger to the time that you had to respond to still make it a fine situation Your opponent pulls five workers to fight off your one probe This is fantastic And at 110, 10, 10, you're aware of this. However, you are not doing anything and in the first, well, I think you had three to four seconds Actually not too much time But if you're busy harassing over here, it probably is a key thing to look at that worker Because this probe, no matter how much you're going to look at it, isn't going to fight this one SVV any better Now, you had a pylon on the low ground already, as well as a gateway, and you kill the worker So you can just throw down a cybernetic corps, pull two to three workers to kill this eBay really fast and build a nexus A zealot here is kind of wasted Well, not kind of wasted It's extremely wasted money. You didn't have gas either But it's a painful start for you So you lost your scouting probe You're getting eBay blocked and you're getting a zealot and you forgot your gas This is the type of start that if I would have it, I would already be back in the lobby You know, back in the loading screen Searching for my next game There's no way that I'd stay in here This is absolutely awful Your nexus is delayed for no real reason because you wanted to do zealot You could have just pulled workers, killed the eBay faster and saved more money Don't forget that for every second a worker isn't working, he costs about one mineral. Now, that means if you pull three workers for about, what is it, 15 seconds or two extra workers for 15 seconds, you're going to be losing like 45 minerals or so And you get the eBay down a lot faster as well, which is good And on top of that, you're less likely to be supply blocked so you can continue your worker production All of these things are positives if you hadn't noticed yet So, yes, I would say pull extra workers, especially if the eBay is that low Now, if that eBay already is like 99% done and then you realize there's an eBay, sure, get a zealot. It's probably going to be faster to get a zealot rather than having to pull six workers for two and a half minutes attacking that eBay Now, because you lost your scouting probe, you have no information whatsoever Your zealot stayed at home after killing the eBay for a fair amount of time I can only imagine I'm not quite sure doing what I think you did, did you spot that? I think you did, right? Bum-pum-b-dum Yep, definitely did see that Okay, well, you're also going to get destroyed most likely by these two marauders See you get a stalker, or you have a robotics facility on the way No worker production here whatsoever, for whatever reason I do not quite understand why. You do get the important information that there's three marauders on the way That is actually extremely important because it allows you to get a battery Without a battery, you can't hold Single battery is going to be enough, your Nexus will finish in time as well And you also see that there's a Nexus, so you know it's not a one base all in You know it's going to be a non, not very dedicated attack here Single battery will be enough 100 energy on the battery, plus the potential for a super battery, or I think the actual name is battery overcharge, but we like to call it a super battery because it's super powerful And you also have a robotics facility on the way. So with an immortal, you're absolutely going to be able to completely destroy these marauders Now, on top of that, you're not producing any workers whatsoever, or hard, no, actually, not any workers whatsoever, which is bad Your positioning of the units is bad because your stalker was too far forward Your adept couldn't fight Could have just fought here on the top side being healed by this single battery Now, both batteries are practically empty at this point You still haven't built a single worker So despite this marauder attack being completely useless here, you're actually behind which is impressive because in reality your opponent lost more than you You have the perfect tech to deal with this. You still have the perfect tech to deal with any potential Cyclone follow-ups as well You can get a Warp Prism to pick up your Immortals if you want to So your position should have been very good, but because you haven't been macroing, it's actually quite bad And that sucks Your follow-up is going to be two extra Gateways And whenever I see infrastructure being produced, I always want to ask myself, hey, what is the goal going to be with these two extra Gateways? So these two Gateways will provide value about 53 seconds or so after they're being warped in So this feels a little bit to me like it's going to be some type of push. Do I like this type of push? Generally, generally no The reason for that is because it's going to hit way too late Your opponent is already aware that there's a robotic facility out as well If this was a more standard gaming, your opponent would have even gotten a single tank or a bunker, you would have been completely dead Against a mine drop, you would have been in major trouble as well A, because you don't have units in the correct position, and B, because the moment there's a mind drop, you need to leave units in your base at all times, and that means that your push is going to be way too small. So, yeah, had this Tarran built a bunker or a tank or anything slightly standard, you'd have been in a world of trouble. Right now, because your opponent is playing Triple Factory Cyclone, which is something I honestly haven't seen since early 2017 you might actually be in an okay spot but you shouldn't be and that's what's important to remember as well winning is important of course don't get me wrong if you win that would be very cool but you shouldn't win at least in my mind you shouldn't win you're going to start morphing in some you're warping in some units over here morphing twilight council gets built as well to extra gases so this push I just want to talk about this really little bit. I see this stuff a lot and that's that's an issue where people they go for a push that has the investment of an all-in and the reward of a semi-all-in or perhaps a minor poke If you're going to all-in in any type of scenario, you should really commit to that all-in It makes no sense that if you're trying to maximize some type of timing in which you're investing not just a lot of money, but also a lot of resources And you know that you're going lose these units most likely, right? This is a standard timing for Stim to finish You don't have blink You don't have any mechanic to be capable of running away. So if you lose the fight, you'll lose all of this This is a committed army That means that you want to make this army as strong as possible If you don't want to make a committed army, you should go for some type of harassment army Get a couple of blink stalkers Get a dark templar drop Start with an Oracle I don't care But this is an army that's supposed to commit It then makes no sense to not maximize that timing There is no future for you in a normal game if this push doesn't just straight up kill or do you a crap ton of damage Right now what you're doing is kind of the in-between road It's not an all-in. It's not a macro build with some harassment It's an all-in with a late Twilight Council, but also an all-in with very little power And you're Usually these don't tend to work, even at the lower levels, or maybe especially at the lower levels Anyway, six cyclones are out already over here Seven cyclones actually out Can I count correctly? Yes, I can count correctly I believe we already have the rockets I keep forgetting what they're called Super space missiles or something like that Ultra rockets What was that? Where were you going? I was just looking at the meaning map I just want to make sure that I saw this correct I'm just going to speed it up You poked up to see. Can I still not walk here? I haven't been in mind yet I don't know why, but it makes me really happy when people make this type of mistake You sometimes have it as well when you're walking on the street, you know, you're walking on the street and all of a sudden you realize that you're walking in the incorrect direction You know, this happens Even if it's a street, you walk many times Like, oh, that's not where I'm supposed to go And what I very often do is pretend that I receive some type of new information I'll do like, oh, and then pretend like I forgot something at home. Or I look at my phone and go, ah, rather than just turning around in the middle of the street Because no one would care And here, I feel like Wolfie Rat tried to do something similar here, you know? He walked in there and pretended like it was intended and then just walked, whoop, straight to the other side This push actually looks like there has some real potential, by the way. with a couple of decent force fields could really achieve something here okay well now it's going to be a lot harder with losing four stalkers already but maybe still with force fields it's possible definitely want to be getting that prism over here because the prism is one of the few mechanisms uh with which you can cancel the cyclone lock on at this point i'll think you should just really run away use the prism to evacuate it's the only thing you can truly do you can't lose every single unit here you are going to lose every single unit this point this game is actually looks fairly over Third base is on the way You have 42 workers. There is a hidden third base, which I think you even mentioned in your balanced complaint form that you're going to scout it later on I'm so I'm curious to see about that as well This guy already has the halions on the way or the blue flame helion It's looking like a pretty bad game for you right now, but you can still take correct paths from this point on as well. So if you're playing against someone that's playing pure cyclone most of the time they're going to follow this up with with hellions mines or tanks that type of stuff i think the one thing that is fairly obvious which is a good call is the disruptor yeah i was gonna say if you get a robo bay right now this is still somewhat of a salvageable position it is difficult for terran players that are playing meck to actually kill protos players because protos is pretty strong defensively and mac while it's on the map is extremely vulnerable meck is only good if it is in a siege position And even then, if it's not a siege position with a wall behind it or a wall on the side, it's fairly easy to flank it. There's also issues, of course, if you move out with Mac, that base trades can happen So Mac just has a lot of issues, and one of those issues that you can finish is that allows Protos players to sometimes come back into games in which they have no business being in whatsoever Double Forge, I'm not a huge fan of Armour upgrades just don't do too much against Mac units, majority of the time Mac units are known for their very high kind of single-distance damage outputs, like a very high number, so like one armor doesn't do much Well, if you have units with a way higher rate of fire, armor is going to be way more useful because the armor counts more and more. For the people that don't know, armor takes off one damage Every armor point takes off one damage of your opponent's attack So if you have two armor and your opponent usually deals five damage, it will only deal three damage If you have a very high fire rate, like a marine, then yeah, armor upgrades are fantastic But against a tank with a low fire rate, very high, kind of of point damage and yeah, armor is pretty useless So we often only see attack upgrades coming out of Protos players and that allows for more tech as well We have some sentries in position, a couple of batteries here as well This is a fight you can probably, well not, well maybe actually you can win. He's targeting your Nexus down Should probably heal that with one of the super batteries Might have still fallen though Force fields also weren't good If you had responded in time with the force fields or if the force would have been in the correct position, I'm not saying you necessarily would have held the Nexus, but you definitely would have had an even better fight And even this was kind of okay Resources lost is still pretty close You have your disruptors on the way So now you have a unit that Terran absolutely has nothing against, as long as you fire the disruptor shot just barely in time or just in time You're always going to be fine Disruptors have fantastic range. You can force the cyclones out of their least range And that is really the only thing that often matters If you have enough disruptors, you can push a Terran army back really easily So the moment disruptors come out, Terran is forced to transition into tanks, which has slightly less range than a disruptor, but it's a lot harder to fight against as the disruptor player, especially if you don't have full vision Dark Shrine, I know when behind Dark Shrine, but often against Mac games, it's not actually the correct call The reason for that is with Mac, you tend to have quite some minerals floating You can build extra command centers you can easily afford Tourette. And on top of that, the Terran also tends to be at home, which makes defending any type of run bys a lot easier If you're going to do anything, I much prefer just seeing salads, honestly, majority of the time Just salads are good If you can get them in the main base with a prism, that's good But otherwise, meh, not so much You still really haven't scouted the third base I don't think you can say I scouted the third base, like it's a big deal If you do it five minutes after that third base was built, I think this thing actually went down at like the six minute mark or so the base is practically mined out. It's like, yeah, well, it's great that you scouted it, but it's a little bit late That's like me scouting Cerro's mutas as they hit my main base Like, well, I scouted the mutas as they were killing my probes, and still I couldn't win Like, well, that's not entirely how StarCraft 2 works Okay When I saw Disruptors, I was happy When I saw this first purification Nova come out of the Disruptor, chase these stalkers, and then kill one stalker and damage to Pylans I was a little bit less happy And I am actually a little bit afraid right now Okay So so far you've shot three purification novas You killed two stalkers and the third one hit absolutely nothing. This has to be some type of record in the negative sense of the word This is extremely poor It's really not how they're supposed to be used I'm not sure how you do, but I feel like you're doing is you use the purification of it and select your entire army and then click it back on the same spot And then the ball gets used as well and it moves to where your army is moving That is not quite what you want often If you're not quite sure what to do, just shoot the ball and then I'll control anything else Just control the disruptors Trust me, buddy, you're going to be just fine because that's what I do as well. Just shoot the ball and then you'll see what happens from that point on out Five more zealots on the way without charge, a very useful addition to this army, I have to admit even with charge, I don't think they'd be too useful Without charge, they're completely useless Oh, we might actually just use them for spreading out some units around the left In that case, I don't mind it too much Just probes are cheaper for that purpose Moving disruptors You still haven't scouted this third base Okay, I'm going to raise another point here If in the, first of all, in the imbalance complaint form, no shoutouts, rule number one And number two, no lies or practically lies. Technically, I'm sure you're still going to scout your opponent's hidden third base, but you're not allowed to say you scouted your opponent's hidden third base if you scouted like eight minutes after it went down That is just actually not allowed Okay, this is practically lying I know technically it's not lying, but we don't work with technicalities here This is lying Wolfira is a liar and made a shout out on his resume And we don't allow either of these things You lose the base, but you kill a bunch of cyclones Honestly, not a bad trade This is kind of how you're supposed to use it Now these disruptors have some purpose I like it Of course, the disruptor is also an absolute king unit. Or actually, the queen is more powerful in chess It's a queen unit, like the queen and chess, and taking out widow mines Because widow mines are static, and you don't need detection for your purification nova to hit So you can just throw your purification novas because you know there's mines here, because you've lost two probes here already Once again, someone without object permanent Now you scout the fourth base, which you believe to be the third base Now, this is not how it works This is not how it works If you scout something in the order that it wasn't built in, then that doesn't mean all of a sudden that the order you scout things in is how it is built. That sentence made no sense I'm going to explain it Imagine we have Wolfie Ra and he's a completely blank slate Hasn't seen any in his life yet before He's born We take him to the hospital Seas the hospital Second thing, we take him to the supermarket, sees the supermarket Then we take him to the pyramids in Egypt With the logic that he used in this game, he would conclude that the hospital and the supermarket were built before the pyramids in Egypt, which is obviously false Just like it's false that he scouted the third base, you scout the fourth base and you take out the SEV that was building it That is very different from scouting the third base. And the fact that you think this is a third base is a testament to your extremely poor scouting, which, to be quite frank, you haven't done whatsoever yet this game You have no vision whatsoever on the factories You have no vision on even if there is a third base over here or a third base over here or a base over here or a base over here or even over here you haven't quite seen yet And maybe you would have seen the top side You have zero information You don't know infrastructure Don't know production You don't know how many armories there are You don't know how many Ghost Academies? Okay, to be fair, I hadn't seen that either. I'm going to let the ghost academies slip The fact that you didn't know, there were two ghost academies on the map, I will not make fun of you for that Because quite frankly, that is kind of wild And even if you would have seen it, you might have thought it's like an illusion, you know, if you're walking in the, what's the word for those? If you walk in the desert and you think you see some water, there's a specific word for that that I just can't quite, get to and that is absolutely unbelievable. Anyway, your position, honestly, despite all of your failures in the early part of the game, the mid part of the game, and the current state of the game, you're still in an okay position You're completely fine, except for the fact that you have no vision on the map Your army is very well equipped to deal with your opponent's army You have a high disruptor count You have eight to be exact Your opponent has 14 cyclones That means that if every disruptor takes out one cyclone, you're going to be able to to be absolutely golden But because you have no vision, you cannot bring your units in position before the fight. So here you have another fight where you kill half a Cyclone and you lose ten Stalkers. Disruptors are moving in. Okay. Three Hellbats. Half one of your own Pylons. But I like killing the three Hellbats. And you lose your base. Okay. Mines also are going to get taken out. Still, despite this, not being great. Hello. Shoot! Shoot! Sure! The purification nova. If you're building eight Disruptors, it's very important that you use them properly. If you have eight Disruptors, you can throw a nova basically every three seconds, every two seconds, two and a half seconds, and you will still always have a nova available. This is very big and it's something that you definitely should be using here. I like this move out of the Terran a lot, by the way I just want to point out the difference here So your run by without charge gets caught by a bunch of units Your opponent run by doesn't get caught because you weren't in position because you just F2A move with your entire army across the map, despite you actually having an army in position that could have potentially dealt with this You haven't rebuilt your base yet despite having 2,100 minerals You still have no vision whatsoever on the map So both of you kill a base, but your runby got completely cleaned up And also this was very preventable. While this wasn't preventable, your army right now is stronger than your opponents, and does you have control? Your opponent played this out pretty well for how bad of a spot he is in, because let's face it, he's actually in a bad spot You're ahead You're actually quite far ahead Disruptors are just going to give you so much value in every single fight from this point on that I kind of have a difficult time seeing how you're going to be losing this game Once again, okay, well, this is really bad walked into four mines, every single one shot The cyclones did some damage He still haven't rebuilt any of the bases yet either Still, you kind of push it away. I honestly wouldn't feel so uncomfortable in this position Just because you still have such a large immortal count, or the immortal count, disruptor count, excuse me Now, this stalker run by obviously makes no sense whatsoever Because the main reason why your army is good is because of the disruptor And the one thing your army is really bad against is when you don't have anything to zone or anything to catch these cyclones with And what do you end up doing? You split up your army in two parts, making it easier for your opponent to fight these individual parts of the army A, because they're quite small, and B, because they should never be capable of catching cyclones. Like, if this army was together and you walked into it, like what's about to happen here, you're just going to lose a bunch of your stalkers Top of that you're attacking into a planetary, which is the third base, by the way This is the third base There's also a base over here, which is a planetary Oh, you had something about that, didn't you? I kind of wanted to read that What was it again? Buildings that can be repaired and defend themselves Now, this is not actually something that is unique to the Terran race Yes, the fact that it's called repair is unique to the Terran race So once again, on a technicality, you could have me here. I'm sure that a judge might say, well, technically, Terran is the only race that can repair, buildings that can defend themselves But a cannon can be healed by a battery Spine crawlers and spore crawlers can also be healed by transfuse And also, I believe they have standard regeneration as all But I'm not entirely sure about that right now, now that I'm put on the spot So Hamster will have a nice little annotation making fun of me playing this game for 12 years It's just stupid Very funny But yeah, it's just a weird thing to complain about Everyone has static defense. If you were going to complain about the fact that they have static defense, complain about the fact that their static defense is 1,500 minerals, or it's like a command center or something But too fair, it's really expensive as well I don't actually think it's that weird It makes some sense But once again, your disruptors, fantastic traits all around Like, the answer is right in front of you, but rather than using it Just kill your own immortal Rather than using that in the offense, which, by the way, disruptors are so good at killing planetaries, because you force your opponents to move the SEVs away with the repair Like, the Disruptor is such a key unit in breaking siege positions with planetaries Great against minds. Honestly, great against everything your opponent has right now And it's just tilting me Like, I feel my body temperature just rising because you're not using them Now finally you use them You still have no vision whatsoever at home or anywhere on the map Why are you just using your stalkers It just makes no sense Just none You could have done this five minutes Not all at the same time though You still have one available There's one here What is this reaction speed? I want to see this fight again Okay So, okay This is a planetary that has like almost no HP left. You know that if you just shoot two shots or one shot at a time, these SEVs can never repair and also the purification orb it's called I call what's called the purification Nova It's an orb Purification orb, it moves in It also deals damage by itself So this thing is going to go down with two or three well-timed purification orbs with a bit of an interval in between them Instead, you shoot six Three of them don't even deal damage to this Then you have one purification orb available as your opponent's army pushes in, you wait until your opponent gets a lock-on on your disruptor, then you shoot it, and it barely dies. And even if it wouldn't have died, it only would have gotten a single cyclone And this is how you lose the game This is literally it After everything you've done wrong in this game, your complete lack of scouting, your lack of map control, the lack of knowledge of the fact that there's a hidden third base for 10 minutes into the game Literally everything so far you've done wrong, you stayed in the game because of the disruptor, then you take the worst fight that I've seen in probably my entire life Every single thing you did there was incorrect You could have done, you know, sometimes you have like these simulations where you can simulate a fight like a million times. If you could simulate this fight a million times, this was the worst possibility out of all of them There is nothing that you could have done that would have been worse Mainly because the majority of your army consisted of disruptor, so you couldn't have even killed your own army there Like, you literally just used this It's actually difficult to imagine another human being having a worse fight than this I can't stress this enough And even at this point, now, okay, you're actually dead Now it's actually over I'm not going to pretend it What? Maybe? No, it's not It's over It's over There's nothing left for you here to do It's time to leave this game Gonna lose your sentries. Have a single DT warp in Is this your first DT that you're building, by the way? Nice darks, right? 14 Disruptors have been lost I actually can't believe that you lost more units playing disruptors against someone that played Mine Cyclone This is actually incomprehensible to me In my mind, this is is a hard counter Like, the unit that is the best against Cyclone mine is the disruptor I don't understand how you can trade poorly with this Like, I don't even know how I can truly advise her Like, you're just lacking everything from start to finish You have no scouting, no information You had poor eco, bad unit positioning, poor unit control You had the correct army composition I applaud you for that. But, I mean, like the first three shots You shot two stalkers, a pylon, and this piece of grass, which we're never going to see grass grow there anymore He's been nuked very thoroughly by you, but I am not quite sure if there's anything that I can say here is like theory-wise that would even help Like you just, you need to work on the execution on every single level of your play from start to finish Like, you have two little workers at the start as well You just stop building workers Your early game responses were also very incorrect, by the way Your build order in general made no sense So kind of add that on top of the list as well. I honestly, I wouldn't have been surprised if this Terran, if he would have lost, if he also would have sent in this replay Because this was actually a little bit ridiculous Like Mac is really bad against Protols Thanks, at least, I can see how you can lose against But pure cyclone mine, it is difficult to lose against pure cyclone mine I do not understand how it is possible that you can lose to especially if you have the correct unit composition and your eco wasn't even that far down or your bank and your overall supply Sorry, my friend, cyclone mine is not in balance You just really, really sucked That's the harsh reality I'm sorry, my friend I'm sorry All right.

        "text": "Dear Harstam, I'm sorry, but you're playing an Inba race I have a million replays confirming that Protos land is O P That Protos Air is OP But today's replay is special It perfectly shows that Protos don't even need units at all In this game, I blightly countered the cannon rush, scouted everything I could, and did micro, macro, multitask At the same time, my opponent was happily building houses and generally having a great time P S It takes you two minutes plus 10 drones to build a protected base as a Zerk And when 10 zealots come, it will be destroyed anyway To build a protected Protos base, you need one worker in 47 seconds. And 20 Links, the equivalent of 10 zealens, won't even lead a scratch on it Now, 20 links is not the equivalent of 10 zealots 20 links cost 500 minerals, while 10 zealots cost 1,000 minerals 20 links are 10 supply, while 10 zealots are 20 supply They are not equal whatsoever If you believe 20 zirklings and 10 zealots to be equal, then you're wrong It goes on So, is it imba? Yes, it is For sure I thought that for sure was this guy's name, but that's just how he ended this email It is what it is The name is Lou Zerk Lu Zerk So like loser, but then Zerk Race is Zerk Leak is diamond and the MMR is 3,950 on the European server. And the question that is asked here is, are cannons or I guess buildings in general, Inba? Or do I suck? And we're here to find out The only true way to find out is to do some research over here on glittering ashes Chudot Chuda It sounds like the start of a catchy French song Shudo, Chuda La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la Anyway, Proto's versus Zirk here on glittering ashes So we see our Zirk player opening up with a standard type of opener, overlord at a normal time This is the type of stuff, you know, that keeps my heart at a very normal heart rate, which is important as well. Because very often on the Thursdays, you know, if I have a doctor's meeting on the first, Friday, my heart rate will still be at 160, 170 the day after It's like, oh, hi, heart rate Didn't I owe this again? I'm like, yes, Doc Didn't I owe this again? This is going to be an early pool I think this was a 16 pool, so that it's a little bit different, but it's a build that I don't even mind that much You know, it's a twist. And in these lower levels, like the diamond, even if this is relatively high diamond, this type of build can catch your opponent off guard and can, you know, can trick your opponent can force them to do an incorrect response Even at the higher level, sometimes at lower Grandmasters, I see Protos players respond very poorly to an early pool because it is different from what they're used to Okay This is a Nexus first into a forge I don't think this is necessarily good against an early pool, but it at least is a very straightforward defense for an early pool defense because you just have to build a cannon Like if you're not planning on building a quick gateway, this makes life a lot easier. Perhaps Xactitude even was planning on a cannon rush It could also have just been that this is how he likes to open with Nexus first into the forge It is a relatively economically sound opener There's a probe on the map as well It's probably going to proxy something by the time the gateway and the cybernetics core finishes up, as six links are now constructed Forge is here. Now, one of the reasons, of course, why on lower levels we also often see 16 pool is because 16 pool is really good against cannon rush and at the lower level cannon rushes against Zirk are still relatively common Ooh I dig that Oh yes I do I actually really like that as an opener Canon Six links through a cannon Don't like the movement here In this type of scenario where you're moving through a cannon What you want to do is minimize the amount of time that the cannon has to attack your units If you've played any amount of tower defense, you know exactly where to place your cannons in the tower defense maze for the optimal amount of damage to these units. Now here you are basically the creeps in tower defense So what you do is you go in, you move towards the left side And that way you would have kept one extra link alive And in, well, let's face it, that is a big percentage here of the amount of links that you have If you have four links, and instead of four, now you have three, that is a two 25% less links than otherwise you would have had Or otherwise if you go from 3 to 4, you now would have 33% more links that you otherwise would have had So that's a very big increase You know, that's going from 100 euros to 133 euros That's huge. Your control here on the links also isn't exactly perfect, but you do force off a lot of mining That's a kill on the Yeah, well, could have done that for free probably Should have been a kill there on the probe This Protos is still taking I love this base It's so fast It's hidden This is the type of stuff that if you do this in a lower level game, you're going to get away with it Guaranteed I'll guarantee you that The one thing I am kind of worried about, though, is the fact that we do not have a single unit out so far, three minutes and 30 seconds into the game. Another thing that worries me is that we see 27 workers out currently on the map, which already is quite low and we also already see three gases being taken The faster you take your gases, the worse your eco is I also can't imagine anything that requires three gases at this point in the game, unless you're planning on doing like a nitis off of two and a half bases, or I guess one and a half base because you don't even have proper saturation on your natural yet This entire setup makes no sense You're getting link speed, so it's not going to be a fast roach nidus It's not going to be a queenitis, which by the way, let's face it, would work. So for what you have scouted is that your opponent hasn't taken any gas whatsoever You see Probes moving towards a third base, and you also see no gas over here You could just be sending in this Overlord for free to check when the gases are taken As long as no gases are taken, you don't need to build any units You can just literally purely build Drones and maybe get eight Lings, so you could have denied this base because there wasn't a single unit, not a single unit, to get this base up Now, Cannons take 29 seconds and Pylons take 18 seconds You put these two together You have 47 seconds. That gives you 47 seconds before there would be anything to defend this base If you have four links here, or you have two links on this base and two links on this base, your opponent would simply be incapable of expanding at any time It would be impossible You could not imagine a pylon being built and then a cannon being constructed Like the moment you see that, you can just send all four of your links there, take out the cannon It would cost a lot of money for the Protos to do that, and you're denying an entire base with just four cannons, while your opponent doesn't have any units That would be a fantastic situation. Right now, though, because you haven't droned up very much, and your macro in the early game wasn't brilliant as you were down like 12 workers or so after your six links entered his main base and he had no units to defense Right now you're down 30 workers, but despite that I still like your position because your opponent has nothing Now this is obviously not a very bright call splitting up 12 links to go into different types of cannon setups Go for a bailing bus on the cannon, the battery and then go for the probe Now in this type of scenario usually, you know what? Usually here I'd say it's a good call to send the banlings in towards your opponent's mineral line. But in this specific case where there is no units, your opponent has zero units Unit stab is empty, only probes, 64 probes You could just kill the pylon with your baylinks or kill the batteries and the cannons and then just have the links deal with the links because there are no units to defend He has nothing If you kill the static defense, this base is undefended There is nothing here to fight your units because there are no fighting units coming out of your opponent All your opponent is actually just expanding Your opponent is literally just expanding the entire time This is a fifth base, I guess No, yeah, fifth base because this was the fourth, this was the third. This is a sixth, this is a seventh And while you're killing one base, he's constructing five more Now, that is completely fine because this was a bad trade for your opponent It looks like 20 workers You took out this base, which is a big investment This was a very good five The next move that you're going to make, which would make sense to me, is either bust this or check if there are any other bases that you can take out You have a crappton of links You have bainlings as well You have an infinite amount of gas, because for whatever reason you decided to take three gas, which are never going to be able to spend, obviously. And now you find the next base and you're like, okay, I think I can take this out as well And honestly, I agree with that So we see some major focus on this cannon, some major focus on that as well Now, your macro behind this isn't exactly brilliant I mean, you're floating 17 larva and a bunch of Ooh, more links instead of drones, okay Now I'm starting to get a little words At some point you will need to drone up and just taking out bases, especially with the speed that you're doing, isn't good enough Right now there's also a full wall here. And there is no reason for you to try and bust a full wall if you're up to bases in your mind because your scouting hasn't been brilliant You're not aware of the fact that there's a base here, a base here or a base here So with the information that you have, The best thing to do for you would probably be to drone up and make sure there are no outside bases that are mining This base is completely useless. I mean, it's great that your opponent invests 600 minerals in cannons, a battery 700 minerals, two pylons, 900 minerals, two assimulators, a thousand and 40 minerals, plus a nexus into it, 1,440 minerals, but there's not going to be any return on this nexus anytime soon so you don't give a crap about this Nexus yet If anything, you can get your opponent to build more workers here, and then when the target is juicy enough, you can say, okay, now I want to bust it, now I want to kill it The same here. Why would you want to bust a wall like this? If you do not know if there's any other bases around, if you scout this base and take it out, and you drone up 20 more workers, you'll be up legit 20 workers, because there's about 20 workers here, and right now you're down 20 workers So you build 20, you kill 20, boom, just like that, it shifts in your advantage Instead of that, you're going to attack into a two-based Protos player You decide to bust two buildings at the same time Then allow your opponent to wall you out with another pylon, while half of your army, not even like one-tenth of your army, is attacking a single cannon. Then the rest of your links get sent to the left side now that you have finally breached This makes absolutely no sense You Are you aware of this base? You are aware of this base Like, you literally just breach your opponent's main base And now you're sending half of your offensive resources to another side I guess you're still going to kill everything here anyway This is not going to be enough Oh, you're going to kill the probe Actually, I was just, I would have been called I would have preferred if we just would have cleared this first and that But I don't mind it too much Right now, once again, you're. clearing literally 30 workers, these 44 Ling's, if they were just 22 drones at this point, you'd be so far ahead Even now, you're extremely far ahead The only thing that sucks is that your opponent finally is starting to build units They finally realized that you can build units in this game that can attack links Oh, he attacked his own thing because these probes were stuck I was like, why would he do that? Just empowered some buildings Spire on the way Okay, because you scouted the Stargates Actually makes some sense I wouldn't mind a spore either I don't quite understand the Roach Warren The scout here, you've got to explain this game to me. How is this diamond? And not just diamond, you know, diamond is a large range This is the very top of diamond on my server This is about, what is it, 2 5,000 MMR below me I can't believe this is this close Anyway, you scout four stargates, or three scar gates you scout, and your response is to get a roach warren, bailing speed and a carapace upgrade I feel like there are more pressing issues right now than a roach warren, bailing speed and a carapace upgrade as you just busted your opponent's pace But, you know, who am I? I've only been playing this game for 12 years Once again, you're floating 13 larvae while also having 500 minerals and 400 gas in the bank. I just don't understand how this is possible It is a miracle to me You also don't have a single spore prepared despite scouting all of these stargates and once again, scouting the fact that there are oracles on the way Now two oracles are going to enter your main base and you start building a sport This is This level of anticipation has rarely ever been shown before The last time this was done was when the Netherlands, before World War II, decided that we were going to stay neutral Except the opposing army didn't agree with it and attacked us and we weren't very ready This is a very similar situation that you find yourself in. You decided to have no preparation whatsoever for the oracles and just take the damage You've also killed 105 workers How is this base still alive? I just don't even understand truly what's happening here I'm not entirely This is the first time you're building works again like a minute or four This entire game to me just makes no sense from start to finish What your opponent did made no sense What you are still doing currently makes no sense This base is empty It doesn't even have a cannon If you knew that this base existed, six links could force either these oracles to use their energy here, or you could kill every single worker for free. This is just a complete lack of scouting and a lack of knowing what to do You also have a spire and there's nothing that shoots up You could build three mutas and these oracles would not be capable of dealing with it You could build three corruptors and you could take out all yours Why would you pull away from the spore here? It doesn't make any sense at all It's not like there's two spores here I guess you're building more spores, so in the future it would be safe But these decisions don't even make sense Like, I There's a single spore here. there was one spore here and there's no spores here you send them into into an area where they're for sure going to die it literally makes no sense what is this I just wanted to go again because I couldn't believe all that bainling you said look at these bainlings did he just manually detonate them on an axis Like what was more important at that moment than the Bainling control? I guess taking out the assimilator requires your full attention I cannot actually believe it is possible at this level to play a game where you don't build units for, well is it, nine minutes? While your opponent is Ling Bainbusting from 35 workers And you win This is so so unreasonable. Like it really just is so unreasonable I just don't understand it Like actually Sure glad we built the Rojoir Look at all these roaches that we've built this game Wow, none of them on the units lost that None of them currently in the unit stab You actually build a single corruptor I can't believe a single corruptor could have won this Look at this Imagine we would have two You would have been capable of fighting these phoenixes as well Oh, come on You can be serious Man, I was having a good time roasting this guy and then the Protops put together That's just a dick move, isn't it? That's just not nice I don't understand why that was necessary Oh. Now feel a little bit bad Look, I'm all for a little bit of banter and even bad manner If your opponent is bad manner, it's fine This Zerk wasn't bad manner You just played poorly Didn't scout Don't offensive, Gigi people I actually think that's rude I don't like that Come on, man Yeah, I really do not like that No, I kind of hope that loser would have won this game But I know it's not going to happen because there's nine workers You know, he's moving the spores to the base where there's no workers It's like, it's like these drones, they have, they really enjoy dangerous things without any pay-off whatsoever. It's just, it's like shattering a bottle of glass and then mixing it through your soup It's like, what really is the purpose? Like, your soup isn't going to taste better You might cut open your throat It's not very funny There is not a fun risk, you know There are fun risks to take, but this is not a Like, why are you, you have three perfectly fine sports over here? Why are you to be rallying your drones to that base? It just doesn't make any sense I love how he transfers From the fourth base, without any spores, to the third base That doesn't have any spores Oh, we weren't safe at this edge Now we're not safe at this edge. Well, that's a great change of Great change of scenery over here at least Can you looking at this? What even is this? Like a conveyor belt that carries gold The gold is floating on top of it as well if you pay attention to it Doesn't abide by the laws of gravity Fantastic stuff For void raising construction, in production, whatever it is And more bases, obviously more bases and more probes I feel like exactitude really took the probes and pylon lesson Very serious Whereas the day nine daily back in 2011 was like, all right This is how he's been playing for the past 11 years Poor Void Rees make their way into the main See that there's one sport and a drone. Kill the drone and piss off You know, two queens and transfuse, you actually can do something But not forever There's Voidres There's overlords that are just empty here Spire's going to get snibed I was kind of hoping I also, yeah, I was kind of hoping that a couple of drones maybe could save this, but this is just going to be practically impossible This is a sad, If exact the truth wouldn't have, even GGs I think it takes a very big person, you know, mentally strong to Gigi I'll give you that You know, you have Luzerk, despite all your flaws, your failures as a human being, your general poor play, you have strong mental resilience And you're going to get there eventually. If someone aggressively GGs you after only building probes and cannons for the first nine minutes and you tap out while saying GG, that is some solid mental resilience and I applaud you for it What I don't applaud you for, however, is your, well, piss poor decision making, your terrible opener with a fast three gas while going for a two-based bailing bus If your plan is to go for a two-based bailing bus, I honestly believe you don't require a quick layer, which is 100 gas that you could have saved, also 150 minerals that you could have saved You wouldn't need a third gas either And you probably could have slightly more drones on top of that as well. I think all of these definitely would be considered mistakes Your priority with the targeting of the banlings was almost always incorrect Very often you just could have cleared the pylon which would have depowered the cannons and the batteries Rather than doing that, you just kind of go first on the cannon, then on the battery, then on the cannon again or in like the second cannon It isn't brilliant You waited too long with breaching the natural of your opponent as well, which allowed them to get a wall, which made that a lot more expensive. You never scouted for any of the outside bases, where sometimes, for example, on what was it, like the 8th base, it was just a bunch of probes without any cans, but even the far left side base or the right side bases were pretty vulnerable for a very long period, honestly, especially when the Stargates weren't up on that right side base yet You definitely could have busted that a bit earlier You should have droned up like 50 times during this game You said your micro, macro and multitask were great You didn't have the multitask once. The only multitasking you did was trying to run banlings into a mineral line while simultaneously zirklings destroying a main base of your opponent but they did that fine by themselves because there was nothing else left there to control when you actually had the micro you you popped banlings into a nexus for some reason your initial split of zirklings in your first push i forgot about that where you sent six zirklings to the dead on the right side and four zirklings to the dead on the left side made no sense whatsoever either so yeah your micro, well your macro you're consistently floating larva as well, which it doesn't even make any that this is, that's the thing that often pisses me off is that if you're bad at something, at least let it make sense. Like if you can't control two armies at the same time, that makes sense to me That's difficult But injecting is difficult It requires time Pressing your hotkey for your hatcheries, then select larvae and then holding down the drone button for two and a half seconds does not even require any effort, you don't even have to look at it, and yet I see you consistently floating 18 larva, and that is something I don't understand I also don't understand why if you scout four Stargates producing oracles, why you wouldn't get a single spore or a single corrupter if you have a spire out. Why is the priority to get a Roach Warren and nothing else? Why do you pull drones into oracles while you have a Spore Crawler defending that base? A lot of things didn't make any sense and I'm not even sure if you suck necessarily. It doesn't feel like your mechanics are that bad. It just feels like you're not doing the right thing with the mechanics. I just actually do not understand why you do the things that you do. And that's what frustrates me. And that's why sadly I have to tell you, my friend, that you suck and that not building units for nine minutes and then going into four oracles is not actually imbalanced. You actually just suck. I'm sorry.

        "text": "Hello, Harstam I think that Zirk, especially the Lurker and Queens, is just overpowered In this game I tried to play a 2-1-1 build that a friend of mine told me Sadly, I messed it up the build somehow and hit with three less Marines as usual His response is correct He builds Queens and Ling Bain I kill some of the Lings, but the queens are way too tanky, so he didn't have to use a single transfuse After the attack, I sit back and try to build up At some point, I have 16 more workers than my opponent, for exclamation marks At the 15 minute mark, he attacks my fort base with 12 lurkers. I make the mistake that I try to fight the army, but my troops get killed Instantaneously, and I lose the game I know I suck Wait, what? This is not how this show is supposed to work I know I suck, but I want to know if the lurker is imba or not Well, slightly different than usual So he believes he isn't brilliant, but he also believes that the lurker is imbalanced Now, these are two claims that we can actually research So first, I want to know if he sucks, whether he's speaking the truth or that And second, I want to figure out if the lurker is imbalanced or not So yeah, two things to research here That's great Name is Kshesh. It's an X, E, C and N and H The race is Terran, League Platinum, the M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M Mar is 3039 on the European server So let's figure out, does he suck? And are lurkers, imbalanced All right, here we are with Czech versus Nautilus Nautilus is our Zirk player Sends out the drone across the map straight away And Chag, I'm going to call you Czech, buddy Czech is our Tarrant player who's opening up with a depot at home and no proxy SCV So it's just most likely going to be a barracks at home. Okay, if you're a Terran player and you misplace your barracks, your factory, your Starport or your command center, it is annoying, but it is not the end of the world because you can fly these buildings So rather than canceling the building, I would actually suggest just letting the building finish And if you really care about the position of that building, you can just fly it up one hex and be completely fine It's a lot cheaper than canceling a building and losing the, what is it, 20% of it? 25% It's definitely not worth it So don't do that Just fly the building, please That's to start with here Brseurker check Now, drone is trying to harass a little bit. It's just going to be scouting, figure out, hey, is this any type of proxy 2 racks or is this some different type of build? And it just seems to be a regular opener here out of our good friend Check Of course, the command center is going to be delayed by maybe four to five seconds or three to four seconds because of the cancel on that initial barracks we indeed see it go down at 140, 146 is actually really late If you're quick with the micro of the SEVs and you do everything well in the early game, you can get it down at 138, 139 So this is a solid seven seconds too late already, and we're barely two minutes in the game. That is a decent percentage of the game so far, that you're being too late Like, it's actually quite impressive, but not in the positive type of being impressive It's like, man, it's really impressive that he managed to mess up this much already in such a short time, frame You know, it's like leaving your house, then realizing you forgot your keys, you come back and your entire living room has been destroyed by your dog It's like, wow, that is actually quite impressive I didn't realize he could both poop on the couch, pull my fridge down, and pee all over my new carpet at the same time in 15 seconds. It's the same here with Czech, who just managed to do that in the first one minute and 46 seconds of this game, delaying your command center by seven seconds is actually relatively impressive I have to admit it It's going to be a 2-1-1 opener And if I recall correctly, what did he say again? I messed up the build somehow and hit with three less Marines than usual, or as usual So we're going to be checking out where he actually messed up the build I'm not a huge fan of bunkers, especially if you have a Reaper out on the map You can almost always get a reactive bunker in time A bunker's building time is 29 seconds. and the distance or the time that roaches take to go from here to your side of the map is probably pretty similar, maybe even a little bit longer, like 35-ish seconds or so That means that if you have good reaper control and you keep it in front of your opponent's base, is that majority of the time you're going to be capable of figuring out whether it's a roach all in or not Also, if you really care about that, you could check with your reaper in the main base to see what's going on over there Maybe you can spot a roach warren, you can see how many drones are on the natural, if you want to sacrifice your Reaper for that. A bunker often delays everything in your opener by quite a bit This also doesn't just feel correct Sorry, I need to go back I was looking at the scouting patterns, but this entirely just feels wrong So we have the barracks that went down I think a bit too late I bet this, yeah, I feel like this barracks is a bit too late The tech lab should be started already And you should be getting started him right now Instead of that, we get the Tech Lab right now, Reactor, before the Starport gets built And that obviously has no purpose. Because you always got to think to yourself, hey, what is the purpose of my Tech Lab or of the thing in general that you're building at that moment? And will I need it yet? Something you often see with Protos players is that they build too many gateways in the early game They'll get like four gateways and they don't have the money to produce from these four gateways That's like, well, why would you build the gateways if you can't afford getting warpins with them once they finish? Then you might as well get them later and invest that initial money somewhere else It's the same here. Getting a reactor before the star port makes absolutely no sense whatsoever because the starboard and the reactor have the same building time, which means that if you get the star port first and then the reactor, the star port has some time to fly over for the reactor to finish Then you lift the factory, the starboard can land immediately And the thing that this reactor is being used for is to start producing double Metafax So getting this reactor done, what is it, 20 seconds before the starboard finishes, is actually completely useless And it's money that you could have spent in a faster starboard and thus eventually faster metavx as well Stim is starting It's still 100 seconds away from finishing. I really believe this is too late Your early game, the Build Order definitely has been, well, not just a little bit messed up, but kind of completely messed up I don't think you're just going to be hitting with three less Marines I also think you're going to be hitting a fair amount later than you usually would I could be wrong on this, but I honestly don't think I am Your worker production is fine What is the Zerk doing over here? One thing I do like, by the way, I'd like to note, is the positioning of this barracks. I love it that when you have a slightly offbeat build, which, let's face it, 2 and 1 these days, is slightly different than what we see majority of the time, is that you hide what you're doing So rather than just building it right over here, which does give your marine closer by proximity to the starboard, and thus they could get into the Madovac quicker, this allows for something a bit more hidden Your opponent isn't completely aware of what's happening, maybe And especially at the lower levels, they might have more trouble figuring it out But to be fair, if you see a starboard with a reactor, you know what's happening So we have a supply drop That is obviously bad. And one of the main reasons this is bad is because this is a build order in which nothing happens This is what I refer to often as a single player build order And I like single player build orders, especially for lower level terran players, because you don't have to control any units whatsoever You're not using a Reaper, you're not using Hallions to harass, and thus there's literally nothing to do, but focus on the build order, and that allows you to execute the build order at the highest possible level However, despite you practically playing single player for the first, first five minutes, you still completely messed up the build order in a way that you had to drop supply. These two depots were too late They're also in the incorrect position If you're playing against Zirk, one of the main threats that Zirk has for you are Ling run bys And that is why you always build depot three, four, five, six, seven, eight until this part is walled off on your natural wall so that you can raise the depots and link runbys cannot happen while you're out and about having a good time with your Marines or with your Hallions or whatever you want to be doing So this is bad You should have probably left your base already 15 seconds ago. So despite you saying that you're hitting with three less marines, yes, hitting with three less marines is bad, but hitting 30 seconds late also is bad On top of that, you are also floating 1,200 minerals and 300 gas, despite not a single thing happening The only interaction you've had so far with your opponent is the command center, or the command center is the Overlord being snipe And I just want to say as well that I find it a little bit disgenuine that you said, that you only had three Marines less as usual. This is, imagine you had an exam and you come home to your parents asking, hey, how did the exam go? And all you tell them is, well, I struggle a little bit with question number three And they go, oh, that sounds terrible Five minutes later, they get called by the school telling them that you've been suspended because in the middle of the XM, you started screaming, question three is impossible, I hate everything about this cool, then you jumped out of the window, breaking the glass, luckily it was the ground floor, and as you walk out, you start screaming, Ramstein is my favorite American band, and then you run away Now, this obviously is a very different story. It doesn't mean that you didn't struggle with question three You obviously did struggle with question three so much that you did all these other things, but you only told such a small part of the story that made me believe that that was the only thing wrong with this, but your entire early game is garbage, and that is what wrong with this It's not just the three Marines Look, if you're a platinum player and you're hitting this build perfectly with three less Marines, I'd be very happy If you're a platinum player, you need to use a supply drop You get supply blocked at 46 You get supply blocked again at 54 You're floating 1,200 minerals as you're moving out with your METAX. Yeah, that I have an issue with But it is very different than you made it out to be in your imbalance complaint form And the one thing I literally, that's the only thing I asked from you guys and girls, is that you do not lie in your imbalance complaint from Just speak the truth to me, okay? If you struggle with things, that is fine Did you just double stim? Why are your units so low in health? One, two Can we get a three? Can we get a three? No, we can't Yeah, the double stim is a move that I generally Do not approve of because it has no purpose Unlike some people maybe believe stimming twice does not give you double the speed. It does nothing It just costs you more HP and especially on Marines that is extremely painful So this initial trade was god awful You lost eight Marines You killed 13 links and, well, the Overlord you already killed earlier So you really did achieve nothing with this build order Despite all of that, you're still kind of equal in supply because behind this you've been macroing somewhat okay your money is relatively low You're getting two e-base You have a reactor Ah, this is why your money is low It's a Taryn trick This is a Taryn trick I see this very often Taryn sent me a replay And then they tell me as well, I macroed perfectly, and the Zerk was continuously floating money. And then you check the game This guy is queuing up nine Marines, five mines Whenever he floats a little bit of money, a new command center gets built It's like, that's not macroing properly The point of macroing properly is spending your money efficiently And if you have six mines queued up, you're not actually spending your money efficiently whatsoever It's just not true Okay, going up to six barracks Counting remains difficult for me Or is this a factory? Okay, five barracks and two factories Perfect setup So this is a player that understands the concepts of Terence And that's the fast triple-ccc into three into five racks, into a second factory, then you take a fourth base, which is in an odd position. You don't really need to hide the fact that you're taking a fourth base, but maybe it's a little bit safer here for you I don't mind it After the fourth base, you add three more barracks and you take it from here I do have to admit that I'm a little bit disappointed with your unit production so far It feels like you have less units than you really should have It also feels like your work account is extremely low for this time in the game 8 minutes in and we're at 56 workers Your opponent has 67 workers, not the most booming eco in the world, but still is in probably a better position than you are This is only. It's not entirely clear because your opponent isn't spending the money You might be waiting for a tech building to finish or waiting until he starts injecting so he can spend his money He has 11 larvae So, yeah, I'm not entirely sure what the money dares for, but it's okay This is also another thing, by the way, that immediately triggered me a bit when I read it, but I didn't want to talk about it yet the moment I read it on the form And that is that you said, after the attack, I sit back and try to build up Starcraft is a game where you're always building up And there is no such thing as a building phase This is not a turn-based game. It's not like you have one turn and you need to decide between building up and attacking. No, when you're a Starcraft player, you try to do these two things at the same time and fail miserably until you're Serral. That is how everyone does it and that's how you should be doing it. As a Terran player, what you should be doing with your first two Medivacs is you leave them on your opponent's side of the map. And if you don't want to use them, you just leave them off creep. And you look at the minimap every now and again. And whenever you're not busy building buildings, you will just start using these Medivacs to do things. maybe kill a tumor here or there, maybe kill a couple of drones or try to trade with some links, but you need to be active on the map when you're a Terran player If you want to not be active on the map, you should have picked Protos, we get to sit back, relax and build up as long as we want We fly around with our harassment units, our oracles, our prism, do some salad run-bys But as a Terran player, especially against Zirk, you need to be out on the map Welcome to the hard life, my friend It is what it is Now, here you That drop wasn't entirely useful Another concept that is Holy crap, that's a lot of queens Ten. Another concept that's interesting to think about is not losing your units As a general concept, I think that is something that you should really keep in mind That if you have the decision between losing your units and keeping your units alive, very often it is better to keep your units alive Especially if there's no big goal you're achieving with letting your your units die You look at a situation like the one we just had in the main base where there is 10 mainlings, 10 roaches and 9 links and you drop 8 marines into that That probably is not the optimal play The optimal play there would be to say, okay, there's too many units, I will not do anything here. And that doesn't mean that you didn't achieve anything because you did force your opponent to pull units into the main base And that can be a big thing Ah see, this is the Terran macro I was talking about Floating minerals, no problem Boom Triple command centers Adios Ooh Ooh How many is this? Seven? Seven barracks pure marine That's not good So, the general setup of Terran is that you go five barracks, then you add the three extra barracks And with the three extra barracks that you added, you get techlaps on all of them Add on the initial tech lab that you had to research both Stim and Combat Shield You have four tech labs That allows you marauder production. which is fantastic at tanking banlings, decent against lurkers, great against roaches And also, if you eventually get a Ghost Academy, it allows you to get Ghost out because Ghost require a tech lab Sensor Tower, you have tanks Only single factory is actually producing You're not doing anything this entire game You're just sitting back You're building an army that is meant to attack all-in and trade, pure Marine, and yet all you do is sit back In that case, if you want to camp, look, I said early, earlier that as a terran you want to move out on the map But if you want to camp, get camping units, get double factory tanks. The moment your extra three barracks finish with the tech labs, get ghost out You know, you can actually play a complete turtling game, but you cannot do this with an army that is meant to be trading and fighting the entire time And when I'm talking about trading and fighting the entire time, I don't mean queuing up an eight Marine drop every two and a half minutes, then losing that into eight bailings No, you need to be denying creep active on the map, fighting for map control and denying outside bases Otherwise, eventually you're just going to die You're creating a terrible army for a late game, but every move you're making indicates that you want to play a late game. That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever I just, yeah, I truly do not understand that I do like this planetary as a general thing I think planetaries at third bases are cool I said it But yeah, there's no synergy between your army and your overall strategy in this game, which seems to just be sitting at home and waiting for your opponent to throw things at you Now, you could imagine a million different better compositions you could have rather than pure marine plus five tanks to deal with Zirk throwing things at you include liberators, that should include ghosts, that should include a way higher tank count, mines in forward positions rather than idling with the main army. I don't actually completely understand what you have done so far this game because you're not really micro-ing, you're not multitasking, you're not really crafting an army either Wait, are you transitioning into battle cruisers? Okay, this is also not a thing Battle cruisers in the late game against Zerk are just extremely bad Like, extremely bad They have no real purpose because of the neural parasite and fungal and vipers being capable of pulling them in as well Like, there's just too many spellcasters that deal with them quite well Have you figured out yet what your opponent is actually doing? You have no vision? You don't even know where the creep is This Zirks honestly not playing too poor. To be fair, the Zerk hasn't received any real pressure whatsoever However, this looks so stupid The Zerk is all-inning you on 66 drones You have 94 workers, like 12 command centers, six orbital commands, two planetaries, fifth base on the way But yet you have nothing in any correct position You don't have a powerful army You want to be trading out your marines right now Wait, where is your army? That's all the way over here The Zerk is patiently taking taking a massive army value, yeah 7 6K You already started sacrificing S-DVs This is so crazy to watch You're actually playing a game camping with a pure marine army I've never seen this before. Usually when people camp, they build tanks and ghosts and liberators This really is a new type of turtling with a low-range 50 mineral unit Revolutionary, I would say Okay, now you get the scan See this entire army? Start moving your tanks towards that left side, obviously, because right now all you have is a planetary Your opponent kills the planetary You walk in, stinted, with 50 Marines, into a bailing lurker army, with one tank in the process of seizing And then you leave without Gigi, while floating 12,000 minerals and 3 2K gas I find it very difficult, very difficult to believe that you truly believe that the lurker is the issue here. And in what world is Zirks supposed to win then in your mind? Because if a pure lurker, hydra, bane, roach army, like this army had legit 50 baines and 10 lurkers, 28 baines and 13 lurkers, if this army is not allowed to kill a 50 Marine army army with the same upgrades? What is the counter to the Marine in that case? Is Terran just allowed to stay alive forever? Was this the fight that you thought was insanely good for you? No You obviously knew this was a crap fight You even said, I probably shouldn't have fought at the Ford Base. You lose a massive fight with your entire army, well, not your entire army, because you also had a bunch of tanks just idling, doing nothing Your minds weren't involved Your 50 Marine Army is an army that you can have at the seven-minute mark army or the 730 minute mark, pure 50 Marines, that would be no problem So this army, you could have had at the 7 minute mark Your opponent has been crafting a massive army supply with a high-tech lurkers, a crappton of expensive banlings Like the actual value of this army is insane Now, we have to take away your gas Your army value that is fighting here is like maybe 1K resources in Medevax or slightly more. Like maybe almost 2K resources in Metavax, like 1,000 minerals, 1,000 gas And then we have, what is it, like 2,500 minerals purely for the Marines So you're like half your opponent's army value Your opponent has way higher tech, also had to get different upgrades for the lurkers, for the banlings, for the hydras You get absolutely blasted in the fight because you also decided that microing is for idiots And you literally stim into a lurker siege position Luckily this time it only was a single stim though you lose everything and then you leave it out GG. Like if this is how you believe Terran is supposed to be played and if you believe that this is how Terran is supposed to win, then Terran has to be in your mind the most broken race in the world You're literally banking on a Tier 1 unit to fight hydras, lurkers, roaches, beaenlings, anything higher tier than you It's insane Now, I do have some good news for you, and that is that the first claim that you made that we were going to research, which was, let me check, to be sure, right, I know I suck I agree with you This is the only thing in your entire imbalance complaint form that I wholeheartedly agree with You suck. You build nothing but Marines, except a couple of tanks, but those you didn't use You literally fought with an eight-minute army against a freaking 15-minute massive lurker bane force, and you died The lurker is not imba You just didn't have any counters The marine doesn't counter everything That is the job of the ghost, my friend The ghost counters everything in the late game with snipe That is what you're supposed to be building So, yeah, lurker is not imba You just suck And that is the truth That's the hard reality here It really is All right That's going to be it for me today. Thanks all so much for watching to a new episode of Is It Inbor, Do You Believe That You Have a replay where true imbalance was shown, unlike this one? Then be sure to leave it to me in the form, in the description down below A little description in there, throw in the replay, and perhaps next week it'll be your turn to be IOL list All right, thanks for watching and bye-bye."

        "text": "Hello, Captain Lurkers, I don't get this unit I already knew they are broken in mid and late game, destroying everything in their path They're just better siege tanks in every way They don't only massive AOE damage, but Blizzard felt the need to give them the ability to be mass-produced, being invisible, and being able to seech a lot faster than siege tanks Why? But after this game, I'm also convinced that they're broken in the early game as well I scouted he wanted to two-base all-in-me with hydras I stopped worker production, built defensive infrastructure and built a ton of gates. But as soon as his first push with full upgraded Hydras doesn't seem to cost him anything, question mark, was somewhat held, his next push with some lurkers came my way I mean, why not? I would have done the same if my units, upgrades and tech wouldn't cost anything We'll be happy to see you agreeing with me on this one Name, TOS, Obv, O P Race, Protos, League Master, 5 1K MMR on EU So it's actually very close to Grand Master And the question here is, are Hyrazen Lurkers imbalanced? Or does Toss Obf Op suck? All right, friends, here we are in the game Hacker is Noop versus Tos Obv O P Good luck have fun, good luck have fun. Zirk, thank you, thank you So Hacker is Noop seems to have been a random player here that is opening up with a pretty standard opener so far An Overlord at 13, nothing too weird This is a master level game, and this is a high-level master's game This is literally on the edge to Grandmaster I think 5-2-3 is Grandmaster in Europe This is 5 1K MMR So, okay, this guy is in clan or in Team Cannon, and his name is Tos of O P The opponent is called Hacker is Noob, and is a random player So this is going to be a banger, no matter what happens. even gets a block off here on the natural very cool i like that type of play usually the more chaos you can induce in the early game the better it is for proto's this is true majority of the time because then you can shade in two adept you can send over some oracles to deal damage all that good jazz just going to go upstairs at the one minute mark to uh you know to harass the minerals a bit not a huge fan of a pylon it is overly safe and 99% of the time It just costs money. If you see the drone go towards the third base, you can pretty much assume at the one minute and five second mark that is not going to go back to build a base over here So building a pylon there just costs you 25 minerals I'm just not a huge fan of it You're also mining too little gas Whenever your gas finishes in this matchup, you always want to have two workers in gas immediately, even if that means you'll have slightly less workers on the minerals That is fine This is, of course, as long as you're playing Stargate, which I kind of hope that you're doing because this is 2K atmosphere There's no other build orders that I really like on this map. It's relatively large And well, that's really the only reason It's relatively large And it has nice areas for Oracle's as well You can do a fair amount Hatchy on the third base is going to finish up Now, because this is a higher level game, I'm going to be paying a lot more attention to the nitty-gritty details that maybe in some other episodes, if we were looking at a platinum player, I would skip So I'm really curious about like all these small, things like are the chrono boost in time? What are we seeing unit wise? Okay, we're getting an adept and a warp gate This indicates stargate majority of the time We have this being read it over here. So kind of feeling a robotics facility, that's going to be a cancel on the warp gate So tries to fake a warp gate in case there's an overlord over here Now, of course, there's an overlord in the main base already So this was completely useless I still kind of like it At the same time, getting the stargate on the edge exposes the stargate to scouting, but It also means that the Oracle is going to arrive at your opponent's base two, three seconds faster if you compare it to the position over here So this is a trade-off It's a decision And this is a decision that a lot of people at the higher level, you know, they're fine with this decision. And I'm fine with this decision as well It's not necessarily optimal if your plan is to hide things But if you don't care about hiding things, this is a completely okay position to put your Stargate It's probably even the optimal position to put your Stargate because you're just closer to your opponent's base If you take a third base or a fourth base over here, you have quick reinforcements there with the Oracle as well Where are you sending your first Oracle? Seems to be towards the right side Your chronoiting Your build order actually makes a lot of sense Second gateway before your pylon I'm not a huge fan of that, to be quite honest. Majority of the time, I prefer seeing that pylon before the gateway But it's a very minor detail that if you build everything in time, shouldn't really matter And as long as you don't get a third gateway unit, it really, really does doesn't matter The reason why I prefer the pilot is in case you're getting link flooded or something like that, you will not be capable of continuing worker production as well as building a third unit You need to cut some workers so you don't get supply blocked And getting a faster second gateway has no real purpose anyway It's a slightly faster wall, but if you get the gateway after the pilot, it's still going to be fine. So it's a really, really minor error in a very niche scenario that would matter and a niche scenario that we honestly never see either or hardly ever see Oracle's going to make its way across the map correct call you want to get it over there you already have a little what you call it a little a little hole where you manage to put your Adept in you scout the fact that there is a Hydralisk Den you see a lot of gas as well here and you see a low Queen count and a complete lack of Spore Crawlers at this point now this is important and i'm going to explain quickly why this is important. The moment you see a Zerk rush out two-layer, throw down a hydra then, and get quick extra extractors, if you see no spores, that means that your oracles can do more damage And because it's a quick rush to layer, 99% of the time, really 99% of the time, there's going to be not more than four queens and majority of the time, only three queens, because it's going to be practically a two-base all-in You called it in your form already This is a two-base all-in, despite there being a third hatchery But the third hatchery is just there for extra ling and extra hydra production It just allows the Zerk to continuously produce So you make the correct call. You see this and you know, hey, this is basically a two basal in, but where is the weakness? Now, the weakness is in the fact that there is no defense against Oracle harass There's no spores and there's not enough queens to stop oracles from going into a mineral line even if there were a spore So this first Oracle took a little bit of damage It cast the revelation I would have preferred seeing it take out three, four workers Usually three, four workers isn't that big of a deal, but every time you take out a worker right now, it most likely is not going to be rebuilt, or it will take away a larvae for a potential ling or for a potential hydra. So it will help a lot in the defense The best defense isn't building stasis wards It is actually killing drones It forces your opponent to be more, all in and thus commit more to an initial attack and to commit faster to an attack as well And at the same time, it makes the attack weaker While if you use these units defensively for stasis, you have some temporary benefit, but it doesn't really help you in the long run I also am not a huge fan You mentioned it in your imbalance complaint form as well of cutting workers I think cutting workers to get some key infrastructure going is okay And with key infrastructure, I would say five. maybe even six gateways, but currently you're going up to nine gateways I think that is too many and you're cutting workers altogether, which means that from this point on, eco-wise, you're going to be the same as your opponent And you're also not tacking into anything better You're only on three gases So you actually have the gas is the tacking resource So you won't be capable of out-tacking your opponent So really what you're doing here is you're saying, okay, we have the same eco, we have the same tech and you can still out-tech me by going into Lurkers I am not going anywhere else I hope you attack into me as fast as possible and that I hold. That is the only thing right now that you're preparing for You're not preparing for a long-term scenario where with more eco, where lower tech units can help or for a higher tech scenario where even with a lower eco, just by having a disruptor out, you can perhaps fight a big hydra force You're not doing any of that you're making relatively primitive basic units off of very high infrastructure And the reason why I don't like getting nine gates is because you only have 43 workers as well here If you were on 55 workers, even then I wouldn't really like it I would say, hey, add some extra cannons over the gateways. Because you can probably get very similar unit production and then get two to three extra cannons as well Like two cannons over here, one cannon here, a couple of extra batteries as well would be huge to have Canons in general are fantastic to have Another thing I'd like to just kind of draw your attention to is that there's still no spores in the main or in the natural We're working with a queen per base, which means that had the oracles moved across the map, you would have been capable of killing, well, this queen and every single worker in the main base And this would have been the only push that would have been capable of coming out of the Zirk. These would be the units Now that is what? Eight Hydra lists and maybe 10 links or so With any amount of gateway units, you would eventually be capable of holding this But because you're not actually up in Eco right now, the ZERC doesn't view any pressure to truly commit into this position It really doesn't There's no pressure on this ZERC The only pressure that the ZERC fuels right now might be because, no, the Zerk is actually somewhat aware of your conundrum Sees that you don't have an extra gas sees that you're not mining any minerals here either So the Zerk is completely aware and doesn't need to engage into this area with batteries and stasis wars. He might still do it, but that would make the Zerk a bit of an idiot And I doubt Hacker is noob is a bit of an idiot You know, he's just picking off what he can, not truly committing to a big attack into a position because he knows he has a Lurkerden on the way and once that Lurker then finishes, that's when his time is to shine, right? So he actually just pulls back And I really like that goal Right now, you should be thinking, hey, what is happening here? He's pulling back with Hydras You know, what could be the follow-ups? You're going for a scout I think that is a good call. But at this point, no matter what you scout, you can't really do anything anymore against the lurk It's not like you have a robotics facility ready anywhere You don't have charge on the way You can't get storm out immediately Like, there's literally nothing you can do anymore at this point, except maybe try and stop these units from morphing But fighting away from your batteries also honestly, rather difficult And I think what you said in your form, I actually want to grab your form here You said something here As soon as his first push with full upgraded hydras was somewhat held Technically, you held the push because you didn't die, but your opponent also didn't fight you. This is like if you were to have dinner in the same restaurant as Mike Tyson, and after he finishes his dinner, you challenge him for a fight and he knocks you out in one punch You could then say, well, for the first 50 minutes of the fight, everything was going swimmingly for me But what in reality happened was that both of you were just eating in the same restaurant, not really wanting to fight whatsoever That only happened after And it's the same here Your opponent is not ready to fight yet He had his dinner with the hydras, now is morphing the lurkers, and you just completely walked into his trap Right now you should be somewhat. Oh, you actually didn't even scout the lurk then also still didn't deal any damage So the longer the game goes, the worse it actually is going to get for you Your opponent has superior tech You still have the exact same eco Despite you having a very nice infrastructure of gateways, having a lot of gateway units, some of them even without upgrades You have about like 13 zealots without charge It's not the greatest thing Some of a decent control honestly out of you as well Okay, okayish blink Salets are getting through Okay, this is not good You're going to lose every single salad Get a revelation on these lurkers There's not that many lurkers remaining, only three One of them is already very low. You could consider at this point, by the way, although it's a difficult call to make, is to say, hey, you kind of treat it like a tank push out of a Terran, right, where you say, okay, I can't necessarily straight up engage into the tank Marine ball, but what I can do is I can send like maybe two or two oracles and four or five stalkers over here and pick of all reinforcements while I am continuously building more and more units myself and then even with very primitive units like gateway units, eventually if you get like two more warrants, you should be capable of attacking into this The only problem is that your opponent can move forward, maybe start taking out your eco. So there's some risk there, but it's still better to try something like this than to continuously engage into the same siege-up position because you mention it The Lurker is basically a siege tank that is slightly better, especially if you try to blink into it, as you noticed just now Charge about to finish up You also are waiting for your charge to finish anyway So you might as well take out all the reinforcements that are going to be joining up Literally just five, six stalkers, both of the oracles over there in case there's too many links you can activate the Pulsar beam for half a second It would have been fantastic But now all of these links are going to be joining in. These two hydras get to join as well These three hydras get to join So it's like 15, maybe even, yeah, about between 10 and 15 supply extra would not have been here in this army that is now here I'm not saying you would have necessarily won, but with plus two upgrades, again, zero zero upgrades I mean, anything really is possible You're also not fighting too poor I'm kind of impressed by the way you play Your micro is quite good, the way you engage from two angles majority of the time Your target fire is sometimes okay, sometimes it isn't But given the situation that you place yourself in and the fights that you wanted to take, the actual fights honestly weren't so bad. But this is the funny thing when we get to the higher levels of StarCraft 2 is, and I've mentioned this before, when I have like high masters player, low grand master player, you can't really get away anymore with just macroing well and having somewhat decent reactions Certain strategies need pretty specific reactions or need you to do very specific things In this case, it wasn't even that specific, just harassing with the oracles or getting 10 extra workers or tacking into a disruptor All would have been fine options, like three, four different things you could have done. But you really do need to do them in order to beat it, because this is a tight builder out of your opponent, but this has very little to do with imbalanced If you would give the exact same position to a ProDolz that is 5, 600 MMR higher than you were, that ProDOS would have killed every single worker with 2, 3, or even with a single Oracle, this push would have hit with 7 or 8 hydras and 10 links, and that would have been it There has nothing to do with the Hydra or the lurker being in balance Now, I'll give it to you. If your opponent gets to this position where there's lurkers in between your natural and your third base, you have inferior tech and you have inferior eco You're not cutting off reinforcement and there's no pressure for your opponent to move forward So there's a lot of requirements here In that case, yeah, the lurker is extremely strong and you probably can't beat it anymore But it doesn't make the lurker imbalance because the lurker has a lot of other issues that you didn't abuse whatsoever And this timing attack specifically had lots of issues that you didn't abuse whatsoever It's like you look at one thing and you go, well, you only look at the advantages of a thing. It's basically you look at like a massive gold bar and you're like, I like a gold bar I want my house to be made of gold bars It looks pretty You know, it shines It's pretty hard to get through with like a drill I want my house to be built with pure gold And then you don't think about the disadvantages whatsoever Like gold, pretty expensive I'm not entirely sure how easy it is to actually build a house purely with gold rather than using stone or maybe some wood as well for the foundation Like there's a lot of issues with this lurker push as well. Yes, if your opponent gets into this situation, that is fantastic for your opponent and you're probably going to lose But there were so many things you could have done before to stop your opponent from getting into that situation where you just completely filled So really what I'm trying to say is that the lurker or the hydra is not imbalanced, and you, my friend, just suck That's the hard reality Very hard reality You did play quite well, though, so keep fighting for it That's going to be it for me today Thanks so much for watching.

        "text": "Mighty Harsdom Zircling spam is simply overpowered, even against supposed hard counters such as Helens slash helbats Helens slash helbets are not hard counters of the Zirgling Hellbats are a hard counter to Zirklings, but Helians aren't They are very good against Zirklings in very specific scenarios, mainly when they're off creep But I don't think you'd consider the Helian a hard counter to the Zircling Actually, Zirks build Zirklings in order to stop Helian run bys in combination with queens It's not a straight-up Hellion's heart counter-zircling So the first sentence of your imbalance complaint form is already correct But let's move on TVZ has always been my weakest matchup And to shake things up, I adopted a version of Eutermal's unstoppable unstoppable Penguin Brothers' timing attack. Penguin Brothers are Vikings from a reactor My first Helions are slightly delayed, and I sacrifice them for what turned out to be minimal damage However, he gives me a favor and trades poorly into my defenses I continue with my attack plans, clearing the skies of us overlords to prepare for my strike on the Zirks third Unfortunately, some timely banlings thwart my attack from delivering a decisive blow This is when the madness begins Zurgling swarm from all corners of the map in a sacrificial frenzy The Zirk throws wave after wave into my Helbert and Vikings, transforming the battlefield into a proverbial Zirk roast No, this is not a proverbial Zirk roast This is a real Zirk roast. If Zurglings run into Hellbats, they actually get roasted This is like if you have a bucket with strawls and you're grasping at them, you're not proverbially grasping at straws, you're actually grasping at straws You could have just said it turned the battlefield into a Zirk roast, and that would have been completely fine That's what a roast is, not proverbial The sheer number overwhelm my forces, as I cannot reach a critical mess against the Zircling floods I could not even scout his vulnerable forward base due to constant ling run-bys I know Blizzard does not balance the game around mediocre Terran players, but it's easy to see from this replay that Zirklings must be nerved Name Walrus King, Race, Terran, Platinum, 3. 1K MMR on the North American server So the question that Walrus King once answered is, are Zerglings Imba or does he suck? And we're going to find out today All right, here we are the Walrus King on the bottom right of Burling Red and Itaki in the top left as our Red Zerg player Very interesting stuff, the Walrus King So says that his weakest matchup is the Terran versus Zerg matchup, and as a result wants to try something that Utermal has been trying, which is the Penguin Brothers It's a build that has a lot of Vikings and a bunch of Hellions as well. You can use the Vikings to snipe overlords, but you can also land them and kind of in combination with a halbet push try to deal as much damage as is possible We're going to have a quick look at the opener here of the Walrus King of the Scouting, see how efficient everything is, CV's actually following a build order Now, this is a slight error that we're seeing here You don't actually have to send out this SUV that fast You can literally just send the SUV that comes out of the barracks, and that is the most common thing to do as well. The SUV that comes out of the barracks can start moving across the map, and the SUV that comes out of the command center, just barely after the barracks finishes, can just be rallyed towards the natural That way you have a very very very much very smooth way to a, build your command center and beat the scout across the map You don't have to pull a worker away and it saves you a little bit of money The opener is going to be with a marine straightaway, followed up by a factory This is a very popular build order right now in the Terran versus Protos matchup, as well as in the Terran versus Zerk matchup. What this does is that you delay your reactor for a faster factory, and you can still get the reactor at this point. at this point right at this point right now you can get the reactor in 3-2-1 at this point second gas also probably should be taken a little bit faster okay the entire point of this build order is that you can start very fast halions on a reactor that literally is just what this build is about If you start the reactor the same time the factory finishes, or if you start a reactor on the factory as it finishes, it means you're delaying the helium production by 36 seconds, so you're going to have later helions than you would have with a standard Reaper opener. In that case, if you're not going to be following any build orders whatsoever, then, yeah, I mean, I can't really criticize anything I like to start here, but what you're doing right, now is not a build and I don't see the purpose of anything you've done so far in the first three minutes and 14 seconds of this game Follow this up with a helion The sick thing is as well is that you could have probably just built a starboard right next to it If you're planning on building the Penguin brothers, you want your starboard to go to a reactor as quickly as you can so you can start pumping out Vikings at very high speed. And then you get a lot of helions, you get a lot of Vikings and these units they fight quite well entire point But your starboard will need to fly another 15 seconds for whatever reason It's way quicker to just walk the SCV over here and build a starport right next to it It's not like you, you know, like there's any purpose for the starport being here At least I don't quite see it I have also no clue what you're focusing on, honestly Like this entire early game is just a little bit, I don't want to say disappointing, because I think that's too weak of a word. Disappointing is like, when you go to your favorite ice cream shop and they closed 15 minutes early You can't get an ice cream It's disappointing You leave a Google review I'm disappointed They closed early I'm not sure what a bigger word is for disappointment Like insanely sad Like awful, atrocious, appalling Like what you did here in the early game is just garbage Your entire early game is extremely inefficient You have less Helions than you would have with a Reaper You have no scouting because you see skip the Reaper Like, you get all the disadvantages of the build order, like the lack of scouting, having to take a slightly faster second gas and thus having a lower eco. But then you take none of the advantages, which is the faster Helions, the fact that you can get a quicker starboard as well and thus get quicker starboard units out Like, how is it possible that your first two Vikings are going to pop out at 4 45? I don't, I really do not quite understand how this is possible I'm pretty sure you can get this almost an entire minute earlier, or maybe like four 40 seconds earlier, at least if you play this build properly It is just a very, very confusing start So now you move across the map You would have lost against absolutely everything, a roach all in. Honestly, he could have built a hatchery over here and started moving forward with spine crawlers You probably would have lost The first time you move out on the map is with the six helions You are actually dealing some damage, which makes me sad in a way that this almost works out And this is what I was talking about as well during your in imbalance complaint form is that this entire interaction, it shows you that helions aren't a hard counter to links And I don't think anyone says that helions are a hard counter to links Helions are really good against links when the links are off creep, because then helions have a very easy time not getting surrounded and can just kite them forever. They have splash damage in a massive line Zirklings tend to move in a massive line if you're chasing something So there's certain properties which makes the helions very good against Zirklings in specific scenarios, this might be difficult for you to grasp because your entire imbalance complaint form was devoid of any nuance whatsoever So in your head, it's very black and white It's either good or it's bad And the Hellion, in that case, is on the good side and thus must be a hard counter It's too hard counter or to be hard countered I think that's a Shakespeare quote You play a lot of StarCraft as well Not many people are aware of that. Shakespeare not only invented language, but also the hard counters in StarCraft too It's all Shakespeare So we have one one upgrades on the way, marauders with this How many Vikings do we have? We have two Vikings that are now moving on the map You are taking out some overlord, which is honestly kind of cool Here, off-creep, look at this It's almost like I understand how this game works Off-creep, Helions absolutely slaughter links On creep? Yeah, links are a little bit better than Helians, especially if they're not in a great position Because you can get these easy surrounds on creep, which you can't get off-creep Of course, this position also wasn't brilliant for links, so we need to add that in as well. This overlord's going to get taken out And despite your failures in the early game, the fact that you haven't been building any SEVs whatsoever, there's no third base yet, non-constant Viking production I don't quite understand how it's possible that just now you're going to get up to six Vikings, six minutes and 20 seconds in the game Your helmet push is going to hit legit at the 6 30 mark. I really don't quite understand this is even remotely okay you're floating 900 minerals despite all of this your push still looks like it has a lot of potential and the reason for this is is because there's no bainlings ready for your opponent and there's not a lot of links and the halbet actually is a hard counter to the link the halbet look you say what are you saying in your in your thing even against supposed hard counters such as helions slash halberts the halbet is not a supposed hard counter against circling it just is a hard counter against the Zirkling. If you get a bunch of Hellbats and your opponent only has links and the upgrades are even remotely close, halberts are going to completely destroy links Just completely destroy You're going to need queens, banlings or roaches in the early game as a Zerk in order to deal with halberts, at least if it's more than two halberts If you have two halberts and it's 50 links, yeah, the links can win, but then you just didn't have enough units and your opponent had too many units But here, it is very clear that a pure Ling defense is completely non-viable for the Zerk player The Helvet is the counter to the Zirkling and you take out the third base. And that basically shows, well, the Helbert's are pretty darn good against this You could probably take out these overlords I got sure if you want to Bailing speed's already done by the time your Helvet push hits This is also an absolute first Most Zirks tend to aim for bailing speed to finish when the first two Metavax hit after a Helbet push already Most Zerks are happy if their bailing nest is finished the moment a hell bad push hits This time around, this jerk already had the bailing nest, as well as bailing speed, meaning the layer was done, a fort base was almost done, hatchery in the main base. This is not because the Zerk is a brilliant mastermind that has figured something out that Serrell hasn't on how to get the bailing speed faster No, it's because you're slow as crap You hit freaking six minutes and 40 seconds into the game with a push that's supposed to hit it maybe four minutes and 50 seconds or five minutes into the game You're just really, really late You also lose all of your halberts to banlings And once again, banlings are a good counter to halberts Helbits are relatively slow at splitting Bainlings deal a lot of damage to them And helbets don't kill banlings fast enough And even if banlings do get killed by helbets, they still explode inside of the halbet range. So yeah, banlings generally are good against helbet You see how this worked? You build helbets Your opponent had zirklings The zirk realized, hey, zirklings don't do all against helbets. let me build some banlings and you stayed with your halberts lost all of them that happens however your mistake is thinking that you lost that against zirklings which didn't happen at all you lost every single halber you had there against banlings maybe the last two got cleaned up but i mean like i said before if there's a crap ton of units and there's queens as well yeah two halberts are just not going to be good enough still have your vikings alive you have well still terrible did you just literally get five extra workers during this entire push i feel like i looked at your work account at like the four minute mark and you have 32 and now you have 37 and now you have 39. It's about a worker and a half or two workers per minute It's not a whole lot, let me tell you that much, especially because you have double command centers as well And in a minute a command center can produce five workers So what you did in four minutes or three and a half minutes could have been done in one minute It's not a very good ratio, let me tell you that much 50 more drones on the way for your opponent Just now you're adding your extra production structures an armory but that's just to make halberts You don't have any upgrades for the Hellions either No blue flame, no attack upgrades, you don't have armor upgrades You have absolutely nothing. While your opponent is going up to four upgrades And this is another concept in StarCraft 2, which is quite wild But sometimes you have a unit that despite it being better than the other unit, if it is very poorly upgraded, sometimes the worst units can still win if you're up four, five, six upgrades And I'm afraid that's what's going to be happening here here is that you'll be fighting with halions without any upgrades, without blue flame, against two, two or three, three links with adrenal glands, and then you lose and you complain It's like, well, that actually just makes a, it just makes a lot of sense Imagine you have an extremely, now imagine we have two weapons here. One, we have a knife, and two, we have a sniper rifle You could see that the sniper rifle is a way superior weapon, especially over long distances However, the person carrying the knife is a Navy SEAL with 35 years of combat experience while he's only 40 years old So still in tip-top shape as well The person with the sniper is a two-month-old baby Now, in this case, despite the sniper being a better weapon, it is very possible that the baby is going to lose the fight against the Navy SEAL, because the hands can't even, don't have enough strength to pull the trigger It's the same with Helens versus Helbets. Yes, the Helens and the helbats, technically, are a lot better, but you do need sufficient upgrades You need enough strength to pull the trigger, or once you pull the trigger, some damage needs to come out in this case And if you don't get any upgrades, that often isn't the case Let's continue here Third base is being built on position, eight minutes into the game It's about five minutes after an acceptable third base timing Nice splits, by the way, on the Hellbats You love to see it Very solid stuff Do manage to hold I mean, I don't think you've actually microed any of your use unit so far yet Not a single one Okay, third base finishes You built the fourth immediately as well. Okay, and this is the, this is when the waves of Zurglings start coming in for the proverbial roast I'm really looking for this proverbial roast Okay, 2-2 About the finish up Bainlings moving towards the natural This actually, if you're actually going to lose all of these links, I would suck a little bit These links are trading somewhat okay Helbit numbers are pretty low number You have like legit one helmet now in the back, two in the front before Paintings are moving in Maybe this just was a distraction, actually It also wasn't that many links It was like 15 links. If this is all it is, it's really not that bad for the Zerg, is it? I mean, Zerg is continuing to do things as well behind this We have a Hive on the way The Hive is about to finish up Another run by I mean, he didn't really sacrifice wave after wave He sacrificed 15 Lings and then killed 15 workers in the next row or so He's even targeting individual SCVs with these Lings This is a high level move at Platinum, honestly He also had some Lings here at the third base, so honestly decent unit splits This Zerg honestly isn't playing too poor It's floating a bit too much money perhaps Now 16 more Banes being more, which makes sense. Actually there's not that many hellbeth, so it's still nice to have some bains, I guess Thrones are going to die, but 2-2 is already finished 36 more links are on the way And here we go 11 minutes into the game, Infernal Pre-igniter is about to finish up as well Nice splits again by you, man That's really sick I'm gonna send this replay the clam afterwards You can learn a thing or two Kind of want to take a look at that fight again, but maybe zoomed in Look at this I wonder if you're looking at fights or not You're just not doing anything But I am in first person mode, right? Sometimes I'm not sure Yeah, okay, the camera moved. I wonder what happened here Did he just stop playing? Maybe he has a rule that whenever a fight is about to happen, he just sits back like this and watches That looks like a win for me, still have two Vikings available in here as well The fact that this bad boy survives makes him pretty badass in my opinion That is sick Yeah, this is a, honestly a terrible fight Just even a little bit of a pre-split there would have helped massively Or, um, oh, I accidentally sped up the game a little too much. Or just, you know, just moving in between mineral patches, just anything so that the banlings need to split up rather than just all exploding at the same spot and hitting everything at once Now once again, we see the halberts in action Look at that That's actual hard counter to Zirklings with the blue flame Bang, bang, bang There we go Every link is going to get taken out You are, however, losing a lot of workers And you have been losing a lot of workers 37 workers have been killed in total Fort base is going to fly over At the same time, Zerk has 90 workers Zerk has actually been macroing, has been getting upgrades. Now it's getting adrenal glands and the 3-3 upgrade as well Taking eight gases, building more links Injects have not been bad This Zerk has kept his money surprisingly low And one of the reasons for that is because he's been building macro hatcheries And let me tell you, if you have trouble spending your money in the lower leagues, there's absolutely no shame in building macro hatcheries Personally, I love it It's the same with Terran If you struggle with spending your money, get some extra production There's nothing wrong with that Absolutely nothing I'm a huge fan of this move even And I truly recommend it to everyone Okay What I'm not a fan of is, oh, this is a lot of help that's actually. I kind of do like that I wouldn't mind some of these being Helions just for a little bit of harass I think generally harassing if you have units that are meant for harassed It's quite useful We have Thor production Now the Thor is one of these units It's really good, again, certain types of units like Brutelor, Muralis, Corruptor, basically anything that flies So far, Itaki has only built units that don't fly So I don't really think you need them Now here come the banings again Okay, let's see if we get a split Tank siege, tank, can we get a siege on the tank? Can we perhaps siege the tanks? There we go, that's one That's the second one. Put it right next to it Make sure that your natural is open I really do like that thought No censor tower either The three map hacks not being used Oh I bet that Walrus King looks at this types of fights I was like, oh, I'm freaking 80 links taking out two of my halberts Also that Helene not actually killing anything That's ridiculous I thought this was supposed to be a proverbial heart counter Unbelievable This is actually insane Okay, so here comes the what you call it? A desperation attack Overlord's flying in We'll scout this immediately 3-3 is about to finish up Adrenal has already finished up The control of the Zerk is actually quite good. There's a little bit of money in the bank right now, but I'm not too surprised by that I mean, he's mining 3,600 minerals and about 1k gas a minute All of links are being sent back 37 bains being constructed as well Halbats moving forward Okay And here come the lynx once again Look how well the lynx do against these halberts Man, they're completely destroying them Look at these exploding links as well Wow Man, and this was the supposed proverbial heart counter I actually cannot believe it This did look very ridiculous in my mind Holy crap What a crazy fight Who could have seen that coming? We have a Zerk that has three-three upgrades Look at this. Three-three upgrades and adrenal glands, a final game upgrade, a hive upgrade, one of the sickest upgrades in the game And the Terran had, what was it? Plus one, vehicle weapons, as well as Infernal Pre-igniter Now, let's say that Infernal Pre-Agniter and Adrenal Glens are the same That means that the Zerk was up five upgrades Man, helmets are not a hard counter at all to this This is ridiculous I'm kind of feeling what the Walrus King is saying All right, I want to share a little story sorry, when I was seven, I'd really like to climb into trees So we had this little forest closed by my house and we'd go there for a tree climbing. And there was this one tree, it's pretty big and started climbing like a little boy that was, reaching to the sticks coming out, the branches And I'm like five, six meters high And one of the branches I grab just isn't strong enough And I fall down and I hit a couple of sticks on the way down, you know, one of these fall on the roots and it hurts And there's some plants that sting me as well So I'm not having a good time You know, I'm all bruised up, my leg hurt We go to the hospital, get one of those scans to see if I have any fractures whatsoever But scan comes out clean, don't have anything fractured, no broken bones, nothing. I'm good to go home and, you know, just kind of live my life And it was a good experience as a kid I was pretty happy with that Now, that story about me as a seven-year-old seems more relevant to this game than your IOTIS form Because nothing in your IOTIS form actually was based on any reality whatsoever Well, my story at least happened So the Helians and Helbets being hard counters Yes, helbits are hard counters to links And they were hard counters to links as well in this game Every single time we saw pure Helbert's in decent numbers fight against links, they absolutely destroyed links. But the moment your opponent brings in Binglings and then the only thing you see at the end of the fight is like 10 lynx staying alive For some reason in your head it goes, oh, the links probably beat my push Despite you looking at every battle without my I'm not even quite sure how it is possible that you look at a fight without doing anything Like you're literally just watching things happen I bet you'd be one hell of a driver to go with You know, just sit there in the car and things start going wrong Just hold the steering wheel like this and you watch the things unfold You really living in the moment in a way. Now that people try to get that type of state of mind, some meditate for years, but you seem to naturally be capable of not doing anything when things are going on around you So I guess that is a complement in a way, but not a very useful skill in StarCraft 2 Your early game build order was hot garbage You didn't micro ones, no splits, no nothing whatsoever You sacrifice your first six helions for a little bit of damage The micro there wasn't very good either Your unit comp sucked You didn't get any upgrades You lost the banlings, not the zirglings Like, I'm actually not quite sure what they say. I really enjoy doing this series, but sometimes I feel like you don't actually watch back the replay and just send it to me And it's like, oh, let's see what Harstam has to say about it Like, these are all mistakes that a four-year-old with an IQ of nine could have figured out And yet you had to send it to me, write a text that seems to be completely unrelated to the contents of the game, and then have me criticize and give feedback So, yeah, it's like Zirglings aren't in balance, my friend You, you just suck And that's the hard truth. All right, that's going to be it for today of this episode of Is It Inba or Do I Suck?

        "text": "Dear Harsdom, I hope this email finds you well, or at least better than the way this Mac Terran found me Cherish the following replay I have sent you, because it is irrefutable proof that planetaries are OP and should be nerved I played my standard build against Darren, a safe start with Fast Expo, Phoenix to ChargeLot, and later Colossus After we scouted each other, he saw my Phoenix ChargeLot comp and answered with a counter of Helbet, Benchy and Cyclone We had constant battles trading our whole armies He then went Thor's, which I scouted with my ops, adapting I switched to Mass Inmortal, made three robos and pumped my upgrades to 3-1-3. The game developed and we each took more and more expos, and although I always had more bases than my enemy, it didn't really matter He could turtle and mass whatever he wanted I made DTs with blink to snip his bases, but it ended up backfiring because killing one planetary would set me back eight DTs Finally, my enemy went into battlecruisers which siege thanks, having wasted all my money in fruitless attacks, I saw supply slowly crumble Called G G out of respect and later sat down in my bathup, as cold water droplets merged with my tears What am I supposed to do? Tempest? Switching all my tech and upgrades to air so late down in base seems impossible. What is the answer? The answer is nothing, because Terran is O V I'm glad that the proof is out now and you are our emizier Please let the world know Best wishes and love go lozo Nice little rhyme there in the end This imbalance complaint form has a lot of poetic quality to it Love the way this person wrote, Go Lozo, who is not very happy with the planetary fortress, a protos player from the North American server, 3 5K MMR and thus is in diamond And the question that he asked me is, Are planetary fortresses imbalanced? Or do I suck? And we're here to answer that question. And in order to figure out the answer to that question, we need to look and study this game like it is the last thing we will ever do To look at the build order, the unit movement, the unit counters, everything from start to finish This stalker takes out the SEV and the SEV does will not scout the fact that there's a Stargate here This Stargate, for starters, is extremely late The second gateway does not achieve anything, and this is one of these cases where it is very obvious to me that this player does not actually have a bill order or understands how build orders work Now, the reason why I say that is quite simple. Right now we're seeing 150 minerals invested in a gateway that is not going to be used pre-Warpgate This gateway is going to finish 30 seconds before Warpgate finishes up, and Aster has not been constant production out of the same single gateway, it makes no sense to add a fast second gateway delaying your first text structure just to then start producing at that point So I'm expecting no unit to be built from this gateway Oh my god, you gotta be kidding me He's actually gonna build a unit Okay, well this still doesn't make any sense because you delay your tech structure. You can just build three units pre-warp gate from a single gateway and have this gateway still in time after the star gate for your first warp This chrono is kind of useless as well, as I believe the unit would have popped like maybe a second after Warpgate finishes up So I think this is one of these build orders that he made himself and thinks it's real cool and tight, but it actually looks quite bad Phoenix is the first unit that is coming out, Chrono Boost on the Phoenix Twilight Council is also going to be built here, and we see triple stalkers already out We have some chrono boost on the probes, and then we see the probes not being consistently built. Thus the chrono boost isn't quite as useful Not a huge fan of that I do like Corona boosting workers I also do not like this pylon, by the way So there's a lot of things I don't like here in the early game This pylon is what we call a slow warping pylon So there's two types of pylon in the world You have the slow warping pylons that are not in range There's a bensi out That are not in range of a nexus And then you have the ones that are in range of a nexus or a gateway, which can allow you to quickly warp in This banshee is going to take out a couple of workers The response was pretty slow. There was a battery ready in the natural There was no battery ready in the main, which means that this opener also is extremely risky Had the cloak benchy went, gone towards the main base, or if there were mine drops with an armory present and thus there were invisible units, this would have been a real issue And do unlike the Oracle as a response to this, but this all could have just been scouted by having a faster Stargate sending the first Phoenix across the map and with that first Phoenix figuring out what your opponent is doing. But because that second gateway got built before the Stargate, sending out the first phoenix across the map actually ended up being pretty risky so given the situation i think galoso did it somewhat okay but the situation he was in should have never happened if his builder made any sense whatsoever command center is going to fly over towards the natural we have double gases being taken in the natural now this is a a telltale sign of mec play four gases going down at such high speed another very clear sign is the fact that there's a second factory no techlap on the barracks searching stim, so there's a lot of tells here, but for whatever reason, Goloso is forgetting to use the most important thing that you get when you have a lot of air units, and that is scouting. You basically get free scouting You don't need send in hallucinations Observers are not really necessary either, because you can just fly a phoenix across the map, you can check what is being built, you can see which buildings are building something So right now, you fly in with a phoenix, you see, hey, a factory is building something, and a starport with a tech lab is building something And that would be extremely suspicious Maybe you'd even be capable of getting a quick peek on this second factory or so on, then you'd know, okay, there's two factories, this is going to be MacPlay. Against this type of play, especially with a fast third CC, you obviously are going to be needing a quick third nexus yourself in order to stay somewhat competitive when it comes to the economy However, Golozo is completely unaware of what is going on and now sends the only detection that he has across the map, despite his knowledge that there are benches out So, I just kind of I kind of want to explain how you should be scouting here. If you have five units, okay, and you have four units that are exactly the same, and that fulfill the same purpose, then you have one unit that is completely different, and in this case serves a very specific purpose of being capable of detecting invisible units And in this case, that would be the Banshees, as there are already three Banshees out It would be way wiser to send over one of your phoenixes, not only because it's lower in value and faster, and thus if you lose it, it's harder to lose it, and if you lose it, it is less expensive, but also because this has a very vital role for the survival of your probes. If right at this moment, three Benchies would fly in towards the main base where the cannon is just now starting, or they flew in towards the natural 10 seconds ago where this cannon isn't done yet, this Oracle would have to be recalled and you would stay in the dark for even longer And on top of that, would lose a bunch of extra workers that you wouldn't lose if you send a single phoenix across the map Thus, the move of scouting purely with the Oracle makes no sense Sending out a single phoenix is a completely fine way to deal this If you have a group of units, they don't always have to stick together. You can separate them, you can send one in, you can have the three phoenixes and the Oracle together, and you'll be just fine I don't like that literally all of the air units are currently on the map That means that there's no defense whatsoever currently at home, and that is usually quite bad, especially given that there is Benchies out on the map And let's not forget that Goloso is aware that there are Benchies out on the map He hasn't killed one yet He has seen the fact that a Benchie took out like, what, five workers, eight workers, maybe even Oh, that's a crept on a workers Right, Mr Benchie The one with the kills. I know what Benchie got some kills, no? I think I clicked them at the end Yeah, six kills Six kills on this Benchie Yeah So it is just a little bit surprising to me that all of these air units are out on the map, knowing the fact that Benchies are alive So at this point, we see Golozo is scouting the fact that it's Mac And I'm really curious what the response is going to be We see an immortal being built here We already have charge The problem is that the eco is extremely bad Just extremely, extremely bad Terran is up 10 workers currently And if Terran is up 10 workers, that usually is not a very good thing. Because adding the efficiency of the mule, which doesn't count as a worker, it basically means that Terran is outmining you by like 6, 700 minerals a minute here and that is something that you don't really want, despite there being an even amount of basis currently You see that? 2,400 for the Terran, about 15,600 here for the Protos player Another thing here is that Protos is mining a creptone of gas, not completely saturated on the minerals yet in the natural either We haven't seen a worker build in a while either, and I'm also not an actual huge fan of the current composition And I'm going to explain that. So the thing with zealot compositions is that in order for them to be useful, you need to have a crepton of them Zellat, Arcon, Immortal You just need to have so many that you can just aim into a position You can quickly remix on that army as well with like 10, 12 gateways Because Golozo opened up with a very technical type of opener with Phoenixes, the late third base, I'd much prefer seeing a disruptor approach here Disruptors deal very well with Mac armies that consist of cyclones and Helions and Hellbats because these units, they can't really kill the disruptors Cyclones can't really get in range As long as there are no tanks out, disruptors are the absolute king of the battlefield. There's nothing that beats that unit in the Mac composition Literally nothing Benchies can be taken out by the phoenixes as long as you don't fly over cyclones, and you should be somewhat fine We still aren't seeing this huge influx of workers that we really would need to see So add on top of that, that as we are playing against Mac, Mac has like very limited tools of doing harassment And the harassment isn't what I would like to call self-sustaining in a way It's not the correct word or the correct term But what I mean with this is that if the harassment finds any other group of units on the map, they can't really fight them They're really just good at killing workers. So if you, for example, compare Mac harassment with bio harassment, Mac harassment consists of halions or maybe two or three banshees Now, if four helions find three stalkers on the map, the helions most likely need to run If you have two meta-vex filled with bio-units and they find six stalkers on the map, the stalkers need to run That means that as long as you have any amount of units on the map or even static structures, these will, as long as you have spotting of the harassment, you should not really take any damage because everything kills the harassment unit of the Mac army And that is one of the many weak points of Mac. Is that their harassment and their ability to split the protos just isn't really there Now this changes a little bit when the cyclones come onto the map, but a cyclone isn't really an harassment tool It does allow for a bit of map control for the Terran, but it still isn't, it's not really a unit you send in and you can pick up quickly in a matter-of-fact, but it has the ability to fight, but it doesn't have some of the other perks that bio-arassment has For example, you need a crepton of cyclones and helions for it to be good, which means that splitting them up usually also comes at a price. Now, given the fact that your eco is so extremely low and you're already down 80 supply, I kind of want to say that this game, right at this moment, is over You have done nothing wrong and nothing correct in the first 10 minutes and 30 seconds of this game, and as a result, the game has practically ended You're going to get a couple of lifts on these units, but you're going to lose every single zealot against these helmets if the helmets decide to turn around, or these helmets have the pre-infernal Reigniter or whatever it's called, the Blue Flame Hallion, would also be kind of good There's no more Oracle available, and thus all the Benchies are going to take out the immortals. I'm kind of surprised how well this fight went for you, and it kind of shows once again how terrible, literally any Mac composition is Like, it really is just god-awful I cannot believe how bad this fight went for your opponent I honestly would not have been capable of predicting that I really thought that with an 80 supply lead, he surely was just going to absolutely destroy you It doesn't quite seem to be the case You did lose your fort base and you're still extremely low eco You have negative map vision as well All you have is one observer over here What I would do in this type of scenario is I'd just get a pylon in this area. I'd get a pylon in this area, a pylon over here, a pylon over here, and a pylon over here And just like that, you cover the entire map So whenever your opponent is attacking you, you know that you're being attacked On top of that, one of the things with Mac, especially when we're talking about tank Mac, is that they need to get into a position So if you know that they're coming for you and you can stop them from getting into the position, that usually is quite helpful Your army currently consists of, what is it, eight phoenixes, no, seven phoenixes, two immortals and a colossus Now the Colossi don't really provide a lot of value in your army, I don't believe. I don't think they're necessarily great against cyclones They're not brilliant against Thor's either And I don't think they're absolutely stunning against tanks either So you're building a lot of this one unit that I don't think really does too much for you Your army also doesn't have a lot of, what should I call it, synergy The Phoenix is a unit that either needs to be used as a unit to kind of stop Vikings from shooting your Colossi and killing the Vikings and going on top of the Terran army very quickly The Colossi is a unit that especially against cyclones wants the kite against cyclones. Shoot once move back, should once move back, try to make sure that you don't get locked onto and that's it The Immortal and the Aracons are units that also want to fight immediately So you kind of have this weird comp that doesn't really see synergized together very well Much rather would I have seen you, well, first of all, not continue Phoenix production because you don't really need that many phoenixes to deal with these banshees You could just have four phoenixes, five phoenixes, and that's it You'd be capable of dealing with the banshees Personally, I'd probably just trust on stalkers, but if you really want phoenixes, you can build a couple. You don't need continuous phoenix production, because right now you're actually investing more in fighting the banshees than your opponent is investing in building the Benchies And don't forget that the moment that the Benchies die, your phoenixes are useless So this is one of these weird things where the Benchies are contributing to the main fight by killing a lot of units on your side, or at least dealing a lot of damage But after you kill the Benchies, all you really can do is like lift a couple of cyclones But I don't even think you can quite do that now that there's so many Thor's out Like your phoenix are just going to get absolutely blasted before they even get to that position. So you're just in a relatively bad spot You're still completely blind as well You are getting a lot more workers I like that I appreciate the way that you're building your cannons as well, making sure that helions that would run by or benches that go behind your mineral line will not be having a grand time there Somehow some way you accidentally manage to waddle into a somewhat correct position You're still not near your battery, which means that a super battery probably can't be used in this fight, or if it can be used, the battery can just be targeted down as well If your opponent, however, doesn't take it out, I would always recommend using the super battery here. Super battery is probably the most powerful defensive tool that ProDolz has, and the fact that you're not using it while you're standing right next to it does sadden me a little bit I believe that it heals 1400 shields over a relatively short period So that is basically the health equivalent of, what is it? Four Arcons, maybe? Something along those lines Yeah, actually four Arcons The shield equivalent of four Arcons It doesn't really heal health So you get cleaned up and then your follow-up is to warp in 8 DTs The fight, by the way, I think if you do have the super battery, would have gone a lot better. I also think that the way you engaged in general wasn't brilliant, and the phoenixes probably should be coming in a little bit after the rest of your army and also should not be tanking all the thorshots while they're completely clumped up Because as a result of that, now the banshees actually do stay alive and if banshee stay alive, they have a lot of damage output You also lost your observer, I think, because you flew it into the Thor's and the raisin was there So that is all a little bit unfortunate and just a very poor engagement out of you. Once again, I would say that as long as there is no tank count that goes above eight or nine, I truly do believe that disruptors are the absolute king of these situations Disruptors counter tors, disruptors counter halberts, disruptor counter cyclones They kill mines really quickly as well As long as there's no tanks out, you can just keep adding disruptors and the moment tanks will get built, you can just transition into Tempest, no problem whatsoever I'm also a little bit upset that you don't really have a massive eco, despite playing against Mac You can really take a lot of bases and a lot of workers because the Mac army fights so poorly. And you can basically just do with a smaller army than you could against maybe some other compositions So this is not really how you would want to use DTs you're kind of using your DTs here like their zealots And this is not something that I would ever recommend doing Like if you're, if you don't want to pay attention to your units, first of all, you should be playing Zerk But if you don't want to be playing Zerk, get Zellets instead DTs are extremely gas-heavy They cost a crap ton of gas They're more expensive than a zealot as well. And if you don't know how to control them, which is not just leaving them there and A moving into a base, I would not recommend building them or maybe just building one at a time, you know, because your opponent might not have detection Don't send in five, because if they can deal with one, they can also usually deal with five It's not about power, it's about their invisibility So if they have detection, they can usually deal with them That's the case here as well You just don't control them whatsoever, and you don't even have DT blink either So despite this probably being good trades, I still much would have preferred these units just being like three zealads and one DT. So you still have like that bonus of there being an invixtrifice visible unit, but it doesn't cost quite as much Just a quick tip Despite all of that, it actually was a good trade I think it put you in somewhat of a decent position as well I just have to admit And you have way more workers, you have massive income, just lacking in the gas a little bit for some reason You're not mining yet from these two gases You're not mining from this gas Your main has ran out and your third base is lacking one worker in one of the gases So currently you're working off three gases and 66% So 3 6 gases, which isn't great. And it also kind of shows here Terrant player, of course, with the mules also is kind of okay So four orbital commands, despite there being very little workers, still has okayish income I mean, it's not the greatest income in the world, but especially the gas count is, you know, 1,000 gas a minute It's actually quite a lot You also have these mules landing You have a second planetary coming in right now It's actually kind of cool So at this point, I think the tempo of the game kind of changes. You've been, despite your terrible start, you now find yourself in a position where I don't really want to say that you're ahead, but you're in a way better spot relative to your opponent than you were like eight or nine minutes ago So you're getting better and better position and also the tempo of the game changes So rather than you just being the guy that sits back and takes the blows, I think right now you could be considering taking some map control again and maybe trying to poke in a game change. And maybe trying to poke in a a base, at least figure out where your opponent's army is, or what your opponent's army consists of, because let's not forget, you don't really have a clue You can say, well, I know there's a lot of tech labs and reactors on factories, but this could be an army right now that consists of 25 tanks, but it could also be an army that consists of five tanks, 12thors, three ravens and five bansies, which is what you're currently fighting against, and both of these require a vastly different approach I actually really like this army if your opponent was playing a heavy tank composition I think that would have been absolutely fantastic to have an army like that. You can tank with your Archons, you can come in with a big flank with the Zealots, and the Immortals deal with just a craptone of damage, but especially the Archons and the Immortals are a very vital kind of component against big tank armies. Against Thors and Banshees, however, and also a craptone of Hellbats I'm not entirely sure if this army works quite as well, and I actually believe it doesn't. Against Thors, you have a beautiful unit once again called Disruptor. You can just send out a couple of Disruptor shots, and Thors are really difficult to micro away because they're so darn slow. So I'd recommend switching into that unit. On top of that, there's also a bunch of air units that you need to be dealing with, and I actually wouldn't mind if you just add in a couple of tempest at this point already Or if you want, a couple of extra arcons, so you can deal with those A couple of arcons, a couple of blink stalkers also is a possible way to deal with it I do like that you've been building a craptone of cannons all around the map or all around the bases that you have taken You still seem to be somewhat blind to everything your opponent is doing, but altogether this is a very playable position. If you would give this position to any pro player, I think they'd be very happy with it I mean, you have a massive bank as well You have 11 gateways, which is good And you have pretty decent upgrades too Okay, anti-armarm missile gets hit Okay, this I think was the worst fight you probably could have taken It's really quite simple When you engage into Mac, you need to be sure that you're going to continue engaging into it Now, I'm not saying that if you realize you're completely losing a fight, that it's, it's better to lose everything and then just rebuild No. What I'm trying to say is that if you are going to engage into Mac, in your head, you need to know that you're going to pull a switch and that pulling out of a fight against Mac is going to be extremely expensive because the tanks are going to get a couple of extra shots Most of your units are just kind of going to die as well as they're running away from Tours who have decent range So there is a cost to leaving the battle So before the fight, you need to be very sure that you can go in. If you go in with your zealots behind your immortals and your Archons and your immortals are doing the majority of the tanking against the Hellbats and against the tank shots and against the Thor shots, that is not a good fight and you probably should not be going in Against Mac, another thing is that because they can't really chase you or they can't really go outside of their siege range, you have a lot of time to set up engagement So there's no reason ever to rush into an engagement and thus there never should be a reason either to go into an engagement just to realize, oh, it's crap, then have to run out and take major losses, which is what just happened here. Also, when you realize your opponent's army is working better than your army is, it's always a good decision to try to switch into something else Even if you're not entirely sure what that is, I think it often helps to, if you're not completely, you know, if your fights are just not going well whatsoever, to just switch into a different unit that is very high tier And in this case, like I said, that could be the disruptor But you could also try something like just more Archons in this mix here And I think that would work extremely well Archons have insane tanking abilities And if you get a good fight with a zealot Arcons around, you're often going to be in a fantastic spot. I like this move, by the way I think this is actually a very good move You go in to kill a planetary, kind of abusing the immobilizing, of the Mac army here saying, okay, I'm going to take out one of your bases This is really fantastic I also like the DT blink I actually think DT blink against Mac is not bad Mac is very immobile They don't struggle with detection because usually there's a lot of turrets and there's a crap ton of command centers, but they do really struggle with mobility And the moment Mac moves out is usually when they're at their weakest It also forces this type of siege up. Now, you should probably split your army a little bit and there was stutter-stepping that actually made the damage output worse in my mind this is also a fight that you can't really continue into And here comes another point that I always like to mention when talking about any situation That's when you're planning on actually attacking is to have a prism with you, because Prism allows you to have instant reinforcements in a fight, and especially if you have a kind of like a backline in an army that is pretty bad in a one-on-one fight, but it's great as like a backup I mean, immortals have insane damage output against armored units, but they're not necessarily great at tanking against Thor's and banshees or Hellbats. That's kind of what your zealots are for, and then you have the second line of Immortals So just a single warpin of like, well, how many gates do you have? Eleven zealots I'm not saying it would have won you the game, but you probably would have been capable of taking out a lot of extra Thor's here and probably would have allowed you to keep a lot more of these immortals alive as well Another quick note that I would like to make is, now, this might sound very bad for Dutch people and if you're Dutch you might want to close your ears But if the units are orange, this is not actually good for you This is a bad thing. The orange indicator around units means that they have three less armor This is the anti-armor missile of the Raven And I know that as a Dutch person myself, you know, I like to dress up in orange as well and sing songs that no one else understands and that aren't really that good But for whatever reason, loads of people sing them together during football matches And we wear orange close So it feels worse, it feels bad, but I would still recommend at the moment your units are orange is to just move away temporarily until your units return to their normal color, because they get their armor back in that case, and these fights just become a lot easier. So for every single fight that you have had, kind of turned sour, and part of that is because, well, all of your units had minus three armor That is about as impact war Well, that's just as impactful I would like, I was like to mention this as getting three armor upgrades So you're basically just, you know, there's a creptle of resources that a single spell is worth It's just something to keep in mind there Now, your opponent starts going into BCs here And this is one of the reasons why I also like to have slightly higher eco usually I'm talking 82, 83, 84, 85 workers And because it allows you to have transitions ready. Fleet Beacon, second, third Stargate, all of that good jazz allows you to build a lot of cannons around the map as well And in this case, it would have allowed you to immediately start Tempus production the moment you realize that battle cruisers are out And now, despite you not knowing that battle cruisers are out, because once again, your scouting has been extremely subpar I do believe that Nah, this star port with the tech lab, I guess You can't really know that that's a battlecroo It could also just be benches or more ravens because your opponent has been building a lot of those. This is another reason why I like being aggressive against Mac and why a lot of people just like being aggressive and harassing in general is because the moment you do that, you get information automatically Harassing is basically like scouting, except you're also dealing damage at the same time Don't do this in real life Don't harass people and tell them that you're scouting them out That's a really weird thing to do And also highly illegal This is StarCraft 2 advice, not real life advice Five BCs are out already plus two ship weapons upgrade as well Yeah, you can just continue against B C 's with having a pure ground army. It is possible against very low numbers of battle cruisers, but once there's like 10 or 12 or 13 or 14 out, it usually isn't really viable You can get a couple of stalkers at the start maybe to kind of catch the initial hit Also, once again, anti-arm missile in combination with BCs is actually crazy because B C is a attack so fast Look at the damage output of BCs when the anti-armour is on is actually, actually insane So this is the first time, I just want to kind of just look at this again This is the first time you really see the BCs. And the first thing you do after scouting that your opponent has six battle cruisers sending in these DTs and warping in 11 more zealots This is your response to seeing a flying unit It's 11 more zealots and sacrificing your DTs into a plane I'm not quite sure how this is possible I feel like you tried microing them rather than just move commanding them in And they're like, oh crap, these 11 zealots are not actually that great against the battle cruisers, are they? Hmm Maybe a void ray? Maybe more immortals? What do I do? No, 14 more salads Salads are the counter to battle cruisers. And although I usually appreciate people buying time if they don't have a counter ready, you do need to be buying time for something If you're just building 14 zealots, sending them to their death and keeping your opponent's army busy, while you're not transitioning into Tempest, you're just throwing away resources and immortals and units and actually giving your opponent more time to build more BCs You can't just continuously be building more DTs and saying, okay, I'm just going to keep him busy forever and hope he never moves across the map. Like, unless you're actually actively taking out, every single base that you attack and forcing your opponent home while you're killing craptons of eco as well as planetaries and oh my god how is it possible that takes so long to get bases down are these blinks just bad you have blink i want to see this blink again i just don't understand how it is possible that every single time you send in dTs that they don't deal damage it feels like okay so this is like 10 11 dTs it's 11 dTs enough to three swipe a planetary So you blink and after your blink, 4Ds are incapable of hitting the planetary. It would have just been better to right click it because then the DTs automatically get to a position where they can hit it and you also don't have the half a second cool down that you had right now Still no transition available whatsoever After sending in 9 presenting 11 DTs and losing like four of them to one planetary This time it was decided to send in four into two planetaries And then we were surprised that that didn't work and we lost every single DT Another warping of zealots Of course It didn't work the last seven times They still can't shoot up, but maybe warp in another 14 And then these eight battle cruisers Surely at some point these zealids will adapt or evolve. On the original species over here freaking Darwin Like, surely, after a while, the zealous realize that they can't attack up and that is not very good for their survival chances Eventually they will naturally morph into stalkers Four more Ah, that's the deal with a tank No, I take that back These four were good He dealt with a tank with it Still have no transition ready He mentioned something about this as well He said, what am I supposed to do? Tempest, switching all my tech and upgrades the air so late and down in basis seems impossible. What is the answer? Well, even if you don't know what the answer is, I think we have sufficient proof at this point that building more zealots and immortals is not the way So no matter what you do, that should not be the way moving forward However, you once again queue up three more immortals, despite you losing, well, was it like four immortals over here I was it over here I can't even recall where it was anymore Just remember seeing four immortals die in the BCs Ah, it was in this area after the Zellodrun by that field as well Arcons are not a terrible call, but also not a very good call. They're not actually that great at killing BCs, but they can tank a fair amount of damage A unit that actually is quite good against BCs is a sentry, just a single one for the Guardian Shield, because it gives your units two more armor and against units that have such a high rate of fire as the battle cruiser That could be very useful However, in this type of scenario, I really once again must stress that a Tempest is going to be the correct call Tempest are the hard counter to battle cruisers, Tempest plus Oracle, you can revelate the PCs and then you can attack them. It's kind of weird as well to say, well, switching my upgrades in the late game to all air is so difficult Like, yeah, I know it's difficult, but your opponent did the exact same thing If you're in the Olympics and you're doing the high jump and the guy before you jumps over like six meters and 50 centimeters and you so far have only jumped over six meters and 40, you can just say, well, I kind of want to try six meters and 40 centimeters again because you'll never beat your opponent then You need to at some point jump higher You can just be like, well, it's very difficult, and so I'm not going to do it. You can do it like that, but you're just going to lose every single time then This is how the game works Like, it's also difficult at the start of the game to imagine that you're eventually going to have a maxed out army But if your opponent is maxing out, you can say, well, I don't feel comfortable going to max That sounds very expensive I'm just going to stay at 90 supplies Like, well, you're just going to lose the game And it's the same here Your opponent has tech and it requires a counter You can't just say that it's difficult and not do it That's not how life works Well, no, that actually isn't how life works. I was thinking of a scenario where this is how life works, but it isn't there It literally doesn't work like that You just have to quit then If something is too difficult and you can't do it, then you have to quit, but you can't complain if the other people are doing it and they're better than you It's like, it just doesn't work like that I kind of like this move, honestly Despite, it's probably going to go horribly wrong I like the fact that you realize that the army was too big for you to attack and you went for a base with an army that could very quickly kill a base I think that's actually a good move. Now, I don't think this base should have been attacked, but imagine that this army, rather than attacking the middle where the Terran army was, would have moved towards the right side and just started taking out these bases Then you're doing two brilliant things at the same time One, you're forcing your opponent to chase your army, and two, you're actually creating an army that eventually maybe can take on the Terran army, because this is an army that actually has some potential The Arcons for the tanking, a little bit of anti-air as well They're quite good against tanks because of the tanking ability once again And it's still relatively mobile that you can run away against big tank lines. So you just have all these perks in this army If you start taking out bases on the right side and you start warping in like a craptone of stalkers here to deal with these battle crews eventually or you finally start tacking into the tempus and add a couple of disruptors in there I really like this army and I even like the idea of killing this planetary I think it's good And you also see that if you have a really big army, you can actually take out a planetary fortress It doesn't actually put up much of a fight The repair is nice, but immortals just completely destroy this type of building Once again, disruptor. I'm just going to keep mentioning the Disruptor again and again and again because against Planetary is also super useful. It can deal a lot of damage to Planetaries and it kills the SCVs at the same time. So you're going to get a GG well played and you leave the game. I appreciate that you did that. But I just have a lot of problems with how you played this game and how you kind of perceive certain things happening and how you believe the game should be played, I just don't quite understand it. First of all, your opener, you mention it as, what did you say? I played my standard build against Terran, a safe start with a fast expo. Now, I love it when people have a thing that they enjoy doing, like a safe build in any matchup, but there needs to be some level of flexibility in the build and if you get a very fast gateway which delays your scout and does doesn't allow for any flexibility in the early phases of the build, you get into a situation where at like the nine minute mark, you're down 80 supplying your opponent is pushing you with a massive Mac army That is a bad situation If that hadn't had happened, then you would have taken a faster third base, maybe delayed some of your extra gateways because honestly your opponent wasn't going to attack you in the first six minutes with anything big. You probably would have been in a way better spot than maybe you would have been capable of having more map control in the midgame and taking out extra bases on the side So not a huge fan of your entire early game and how little flexible you are in that type of case On top of that, your process of dealing with army compositions that you are not familiar with or you didn't know how to beat, I think it's kind of bad You just basically pick the immortal and the zealot as a unit and then stuck with it the entire way through, despite it not really working in, well, some of the bigger fights And I think that is an issue. You need to be capable in the game if you're fighting a composition that you haven't seen before to kind of realize when fights aren't going your way I'm not telling you to throw basically everything away So like if Zelda immortal doesn't work, like, okay, cell immortal, crap And you completely tech switch into, I don't know, like mess Phoenix And that doesn't worry You throw out the Phoenix and you go into mass stalk or no You can make small changes. in an army, and in this case, just adding arcons would have helped so, so much for your tanking power, and also just the anti-air damage output that you would have naturally had, especially the fight near, I think it was your third base, where the Benchie stayed alive Like, having a couple of arcons there would have been great, or just a couple of stalkers, rather than the phoenixes And then you talked about DTs with blink to sniper's bases, and it ended up backfiring I think at that point, you were down 80, 90 supply when you really started going for that DTs are a luxury unit in a way This is a unit that you can build if you are maxed out. You have a pretty decent bank and your opponent wants to be active on the map or has too many bases for him to attend to So it's a late game unit when both of you are very rich most of the time It's a very good unit because you can just blink on top You three-shoulder planetary and you can walk away The way that you use DTs at the start was you would send them in like zealots and they would die and you did this when you weren't so rich yet Then at the end of the game you did it again when you weren't rich whatsoever You would just throw them away and you would take out a base. But at that point your opponent was already kind of outmining you so there was no point anymore The main purpose of the DT is that it can stay alive and kill bases quickly You lost all of your DTs every single time And also you somehow managed to make them kill bases slow, which is impressive because the DT just has a lot of damage output your blinks were very debatable there The planetaries, thus, weren't really the issue, I think The main issue in this game that I saw for you was the army compositions that you had, especially once the Battlecruisers came out. You worked in like 60 extra zealots and built like six or seven extra immortals, despite none of these units having a reliable anti-air attack or an anti-air attack whatsoever to speak of So yeah, planetaries, my friend, are not in balance, but it is you instead, who sucks That's going to be it for me today Thanks all so much for watching I hope you did enjoy this episode of Is It Imlar or Do I Suck?

        "text": "Viking is suck Making Viking is the most harmful action in Terran versus Protos If I have to choose one, dare hars them I would have complained about Disruptor, the miracle unit, but as a senior victim, I have been numb to see my army suddenly disappeared And try to avoid entering mass disruptor late game However, Viking, which seems like a necessity in Terran versus Protos, always led me to lose In this replay, I have a winning position in the middle game, but Viking opened the gate of hell Every time I want to trade with Toss, the result must be that Toss lost three Colossus, and I lost my whole army, including Viking Not to say, Viking do zero damage to Colossus under battery overcharge. Maybe I'm suck for Cannot Macro my bio-perfectly under purification Nova, but Viking is the suck unit that forced me to face six or more disruptors I'm pretty sure you will agree with my judgment about Viking after watching this replay Name Pioneer Race Terran League Grandmaster on the Chinese server Now, he also mentioned that he is a senior victim, so I'm expecting someone above 65 or 70 The fact that a 65 or 70-year-old can get Grandmaster with Terran is pretty impressive I haven't seen this happen yet with any of the other races, so that definitely isn't help in your case But the question is pretty clear Hars them. Is the Viking Inba or do I suck? And that's what we're going to be figuring out this game All righty, friends And here we are in the game Pioneer as our Terran player, Protos player with a name that I sadly can't pronounce or read We have a quick gateway on the low ground, probably for some type of early game pressure Taryn is not taking any damage so far Now, this is a grandmaster level game So I'm expecting a lot here I'm expecting a solid build order opener out of both players to be honest I'm expecting good control, good decision making And we're, well, what is it? One minute and 40 seconds in and I'm already extremely disappointed here by the ProDals. He built a cybernetic score before the Nexus, but this cybernetic score is the exact same timing as if he played a Nexus before core So he just gave up economy for no reason and his initial a depth is also just going to be 11, 12 seconds later than it should be with a core first So all of the disadvantages, none of the advantages This is the type of build that I really don't want to see at Grandmaster level So I'm glad the Protos is the first one to trigger me here Now, the Terran did see the core timing and knows that it's going to finish as about what, 211, 212, 210, something like that And in that case, a reaction. here would have been the correct call I'm going to need to pause it because I need to explain something here This doesn't make any sense You only play Reaper Marine Marine if you're either being attacked by a very fast salad or if your opponent has a low ground gateway well with like a 13 pylon or a 12 pylon fast gateway because you need quicker units The reactor takes a very long time to build So if you have to wait for the reactor for extra marines, a single adept that comes to your side of the map might actually delay your command center. But because that is never going to be the case with a core that finishes at 2-11, getting Marine Marine in this scenario is just going to delay your actual marine production Because every single marine that you build is going to cut into one marine later on because this could have been two Marines being built at the same time coming out of a reactor So you never, if you can, want to delay your reactor But for whatever reason, Pioneer delayed the reactor, despite scouting the timing on the core So this is an absolute nonsense build to start with It really just makes zero sense whatsoever Every second as well that he's delaying his reactor for is god awful This was another six seconds. He literally lost like, what, four, four and a half Marines of production at this time And it's actually making me sad It really is making me sad Now, this talk is going to move across the map is going to pop into these three marines We have a second stalker on the way as well And because this reactor is so extremely delayed, these stalkers might actually be capable of doing something Otherwise, there would just be more units here at this point They would be capable of defending better Still going to probably be Holy crap, what is this target fire? Look at this Maybe this is. He just doesn't understand that you don't have to take out the shields from both stalkers at the same time you're allowed to target fire on the unit that already has damage Look, takes out this one, already had a lot of damage on this one, now swaps back to the stalker that he had already damaged initially, to then swap back again to the stalker that has less HP, which should have stayed on this one if you're going to deal this much damage to it Loses three Marines, keeps the Hallion alive This is quite frankly, just extremely embarrassing Like, I'm He probably forgot that this happened in the game, and that's why he sent it You know, he was like complain about the Viking. But this early game is extremely embarrassing Like, really, really embarrassing This should never happen How can you lose or how can you be even under pressure in the early game playing against a cybernetic score that finishes at two minutes and 11 seconds? To make matters even worse There's also going to be a sentry Now, losing to a sentry rush or sentry pressure, is a little bit like getting beaten up by a guy that uses a feather. I'm sure that it really sucks for you to get beaten up by a guy with a feather, but if that would happen to me, I don't think I would tell anyone, and I definitely wouldn't show the footage to a YouTuber who then make fun of you getting beaten up by the feather That seems like a relatively poor plan I'm pretty sure that Pioneer forgot that this happened, because there's no way that a Grandmaster Terran would honestly, ever send this to me Like, don't you have honor or pride? It's really sick Let's not forget that he has like four Marines less than he should have, despite going for a one-one-one type of push. This entire build order just really doesn't make a lot of sense Supply drop has been used as well It's really sick to me that my expectations, when I'm getting a Grandmaster level of replay, are relatively high And every single time I just keep getting disappointed again and again and again again Like, this isn't even difficult game theory This is not like you're making mistakes in the decision making It's just this guy is too lazy to look up a real build order and just makes up his own crap And if you make up your own crap, at least think about the crap that you're doing. But it's obvious that there was no thought put into this build whatsoever, because this could just hit way harder with like four or five extra marines And, well, you'd probably be capable of just straight up killing your opponent at this point For stalkers moved to the wrong Maybe you get a kill on the pylon If you're really lucky and the Protos takes a bad engagement immediately, you might even be capable of taking the Nexus down So for the tosses here, what you want to do, you want to keep the stalkers in between this army and the reinforcements, then wait for one or two extra warpins, and then you go in I think there's blink already. Probably want to blink on top of the tank, because that's the one that has the highest damage output You could two volley it, and then just kind of kite the other units You're probably going to be fine but instead he didn't take out the tank and if the tank gets to survive it just deals too much damage Yeah Okay, this is really bad for thought This game is honestly just over Third C C is done already Barracks 2 and 3 are on the way Is this going to be a Raven? What did he build the Tech Lab for? For the fourth barracks, maybe? I've never seen this before This is the type of play I'm not familiar with. I'm really sad to have to say these things in a Grandmaster game 5 1K MMR This Just a reminder Imagine watching this and not being 5 1K MMR and being confused how it's possible Most of you are worse than this Just a friendly reminder Holy crap All right Reactor on the Starport Reactor on the factory Double eBay I kind of like this I actually do kind of like all of this stuff Um, third Cc is done Work production looks good Terran is still in a good position here Don't get me wrong Like, Terran is extremely far ahead at this point Like extremely far ahead More workers, more supply, better upgrades Tech is okayish because you have tanks as well. Your opponent is transitioning into Blink and Colossi with relatively low infrastructure So not like eight gateways where the moment charge finishes It's going to be great for those No, it's like six, five, five gateways now or four gateways right now soon to be six Templar Archives is not going to start for another 45 minutes or so because there's just not enough gas Prozos does have a little bit of vision here with the with the observer, but this is just a fantastic setup Give this army to Hero Marine, clam, Maru, cure Honestly, give it to my Terran And I'm pretty sure I'd be capable of winning the game from this point on out There's three zealots and six stalkers Excuse me. Make that six stalkers without the three zealers without the three zealots There's a colossi that is being chrono-boasted out right now, and this is against two tanks, five marauders, and 19 Marines It is literally impossible to lose this fight It, like, legitimately just impossible You're just going to get another kill on the Nexus here I think I hope Slight over stimmed I think you just double-stimmed or something I'm not quite sure how it's possible otherwise Okay, at least gets the kill here on the Nexus That's good Don't really want to be engaging with the Marines first No target fire on the tank either, lots of low tanks Could have definitely got on some stuff there Some huge overstimming going on. I didn't pay super close attention, but he's either stimming way too fast, way too much, or he must have double-pressed him once or twice, because this army isn't supposed to be this herd at this point With the first two metaphics with such a small army, you can stim once or twice and be fine Must have stimmed too many times there Okay, third base already on the way Taryn, so far ahead, it actually hurts my head to think about it 2-2 here is on the way as well, which is great, very good call Sentry's being built for the Protos at this point is really bad You have a Ghost Academy on the way, which I really like as well. Second Starport, usually I'm not a huge fan of Second Starport before 8 barracks, especially if you're also getting ghost, because you just are kind of lacking the gas And that's what we're seeing here, right? There's not really gas right now to build four Vikings at a time and get Ghosts as well well, especially given the fact that right now you're also getting enhanced shockwave already So, yeah, you may be capable of getting a single ghost out I much prefer getting three extra barracks first This is what most people play at the moment as well There are some people that get a fast second star port and good upgrades on Bio2, but then they usually skip ghosts for a little bit longer. Hero Marine played like this for a while So you might want to look at people like that I think it's very uncommon to see something like this, but it's a mistake and, you know, that happens Interesting way of engaging This is a very interesting way of engaging Holy crap, that was beautiful I think this Protos could not have even dreamt a fight like this because it's too unrealistic You know, sometimes when you're dreaming and you start flying and saving the world, you know, and everyone loves you And you go, like, within your dreams, like, okay, this can be real because no one loves me and you wake up That's what usually happens. If this was a dream for this Protoss player, he would have woken up at this point because there's no Terran that is above 3K MMR that would move up this ramp on Curious Mind. The biggest advantage you have on Curious Mind is the fact that if you attack in between the natural and the third base, which is this general area, you have a concave that is bigger than the Grand Canyon. It's huge, okay? You can't even take a picture of it. But that's how huge it is. You need multiple cameras. Or you need to take a panorama picture. That is how big this freaking concave is. So what you can do is you just set yourself up in that concave. And then wherever the Protos RNA isn't, you send up like eight units and a Metafact This forces the Protos player to attack into your concave away from the battery as well Because don't forget, super battery Pretty decent thing to have as a Protos I'm not even sure if it was used It wasn't even used in this fight Holy crap But if he would have used this, then it also would have been another reason why you want to do this You can actually take insane fights You somehow manage to lose a fight on Curious Mind being up 50 supply and equal in upgrades as well. This is really impressive because this is legit the best map out of the entire last map pool for attacking in between natural and third And you manage to mess it up Very impressive, my friend Very impressive It's like you just wanted to give up your natural advantage to kind of even it out If you were a tennis player and you would have to serve, you would always do it underhand because you wouldn't want your opponent not to be able to hit back the ball Now, I'm sure your opponent would appreciate it, but I'm not quite sure what I would do to your overall win rate because I don't think it would be so good It's actually extremely stupid. You're also still attacking without any ghost whatsoever Your 2-2 is about to finish up I wouldn't mind if you wait for that at this point It is such a short time away, and it would also massively increase your overall Viking count, because three more are on the way So I really do believe you should wait for that If you do that, I think it's the correct call Three ghosts are being built now Probably should have been built one rotation faster, so they could have been with this attack Once again, same setup You stand over here, send one or even two metaphics of units into this natural base, forcing the Protos player to attack into you. Like, if that happens, there's absolutely, there should be no way that you lose Okay, there's an interesting stim Going to take out one disruptor here Another disruptor kills absolutely everything And now, oh, this fight, okay, perhaps the initial fight wasn't even so great because one disruptor shot killed like 15 supply, but you're still up in army supply You're still up to upgrades If right now you don't get tricked into chasing him into the super battery, this still would have been okay for you But into the super battery and walking up a massive ramp, yeah, life is going to be a little bit less good Once again, the Protos kind of walks away with this with a win. Like the super battery, you kind of, it is temporary, you know It really is just a temporary thing So if you can wait it out or you can just kind of fight away from it, then it's fine I always kind of compare a super battery with the sun on a very warm day, you know? So imagine it is 40 degrees out and you really want to go outside Now you either need to put in sunscreen, stay in the shadow, or you don't go outside And it's the same with the super battery You either fight in the shadow, which in this case is away from the super battery, or you just wait till the sun goes under because that's the beauty of the day. Sometimes the sun goes under, and later in the day the sun isn't quite as powerful anymore, so you can just go outside Just do it a little bit later It's the same with the super battery Super battery runs out You can also just fight away from it Just keep that in mind next time you're about to take the worst fight of your life Although, seeing how every single fight for you has gone so far, I doubt that these fights are even the worst fights of your life Because this is literally every single fight you took so far has been terrible, and I'm expecting this to not be exclusive just to this game that you're playing against this toss on curious mind. I'm expecting you to always have terrible fights, but this is just the terrible fights that I'm exposed to So it would be unfair to say these are the worst fights you've ever taken You probably take way worse fights on a daily basis I'm just not exposed to these So it's different Now, this is a good cancel, I like that Good scan Here you can EMP win this fight Here you can EMP win this fight Disruptor hits all your marauders Interesting move Probably still winning if you just go back right now, I think You have 3-3 on the way You're really overstimmed again You're really big on the overstimming. Also I notice that in every single fight, your Marines are in front of your marauders Now, marauders are supposed to tank for the Marines I know that you've probably heard the phrase women and kids first, or women and children first, but it is really only when it comes to evacuation When you're fighting, you don't want to put the weakest or the softest targets in front You actually want them to be in the back It's like a second line of defense And the marauders that can take a hit, you want to put them to the fronts because they can tank a lot of damage, which is extremely important So yeah, I'm a little bit disappointed here. So far in every single fight that you've taken, I think you're just kind of forgetting about things like positioning and control and micro Just some of the big pillars, you know, the fundamental things you need to know about fighting in StarCraft 2 It's like you've built a house except there's no walls, no roof You really don't have a house bunch of furniture, maybe you have a floor, you know, because your macro, honestly, it's quite good You're over, the way that you produce is quite nice So I think you have too many tech labs You have five, six, six tech labs on barracks I think it's too many You probably want five, maybe And then three, three reactors Maybe six, two actually is fine. It's very heavy on marauders and ghosts, though That is what it is You're still winning, despite all of this Yes you're still winning You're up and upgrade You have a good army You're up in supply If you hit an EMP and walk in here, you can probably kill this Now, another issue that I've been seeing in your control is that everything is in the same control group So you probably literally only use F2, which means it's really difficult for you to fight There's no separate hotkey for Vikings, no separate hotkey for ghosts I know there's some Terrans that play like this as well But if you play like this, you need to be really quick at clicking on the inside. individual units to micro them separately And you need to be very good with TAP And as you are a senior citizen, that is probably 65 plus, I think it might be better to just use control groups because you're not that fast with the mouse I'm just going to say it here You don't seem very quick in the battles themselves because so far you haven't really controlled any of your units This is also an advanced move that we're seeing here out of the Tarran Basically, whenever the Tarran is maxed, Usually you want to fight and start trading out a little bit. This Terran figured out something new, our good friend Pioneer, and decided that rather than having an unfair fight where he's up maybe 40 or 45 supply, he waits outside of the Protos base so that the Protos is constantly aware where the army is, one, and also it allows the Protos to increase its own army till its 200 supply, and then the Terran will decide And knowing Pi, then the Terran will decide to fight Knowing Pioneer, this is probably going to be in a position either down, a ramp or into a super battery or preferably maybe even both at the same time Actually Pioneer is moving back right now, setting up a concave It almost was a split Two Vikings accidentally sent forward. Liberator, a follow-up here I kind of like that, honestly I don't really mind that whatsoever There's two little meta-vex though in this army right now and that could be an issue We haven't seen any bit of multitasking either this game so far I just want to make everyone aware of that Good EMP I can't really chase this army though, but pushing forward with Liberators is always a good plan There's already advanced ballistic, I believe Yep, there we go So you can continue pushing forward Good scan Maybe he wants to send one unit over towards the watchtower right now So you have continuous vision This still is honestly completely playable. Just kind of poke forward a little bit with the Vikings, then send the Liberators forward Now you get a scan Gooding MP again, want to move them forward You want to really leapfrog with a little bit more, a higher, tempo here I think everything moves rather slow Hello? Censor Tower? Hello? Set up the Liberators in the back, please Hello? All right, I just want to see this from the first person view So right now we're seeing it on the mini map already Pamparam One, two, three, like six seconds, seven seconds Like actual the reaction time of a senior citizen on the road Very impressive Liberators facing the completely wrong way Also very impressive, not contributing in fight whatsoever here Disruptor shots are hitting. Fight still honestly relatively close for half of the army not participating in the fight and the half of the army that wasn't participating were the Liberators as well The Liberator is the highest DPS unit in the entire game Having that on your side in a battle is relatively nice, I would say It's like having an AK-47 at a knife fight and then using it to scratch your back I'm sure it feels really good, but it'd be better if you just shoot people with it Yeah, this was an interesting game out of Pioneer He said that the Viking sucks. Now, I think that there's an issue here for Pioneers specifically where if we were to raise people completely separate from society without ever having seen a game of StarCraft 2 and then we would bring them and show them this replay, they probably would conclude that the entire Terran army sucks It's like, look, the numbers for the Terran are very high and for the proto's very low Every single time the Terran loses This has nothing to do with the Terran units in general It has everything to do with the way that Pioneer controls his units Marines in the front every single time Moving up a ramp Yep, there we go EMPs do hit sometimes, so that's good. Vikings are always too late or too early at a fight Marauders seem to not run away from disruptor shots There's no splits whatsoever The micro is the real issue for you here It's not the Viking It's not the marauders It's not the disruptor You just don't control your units And that is a real big issue My good friend, the Viking doesn't suck It is you who sucks Thank you for watching I hope you did enjoy this episode of Is It Inbar, Do I Suck?

        "text": "Dear Harstam, I understand that Terran have very good tools for harassing, but enough is enough This clown played Proxy Reaper, to which I defended not too brilliant, but I was still miles ahead Since he had no tack or second base, and yet it didn't matter Benchy is the most stupid unit in this game I hate Muda's, but Muda's deal way fewer damage and have no cloak Benchie, with its stupid upgrade, is like Muta in combinator with DT Super fast, stalkers have no chance with catching up, deal not as little as Muras so they can fight part of your army, cloak so you need observer speed or Oracle because cannons die in half a second to a fair amount of Benchy. It's flying so he can be in three places within five seconds so I can't fight his army if I can't catch up to it I can't attack his bases because of course Terran Turtle is fantastic to play against The only thing that I could think of going is Phoenixes But at this point he killed few of my nexus and my core structures Maybe if I'd figure it out sooner, I'd be fine But I didn't think it's so unfair and I don't think he deserved this Name Adamin, race protels, league master, an MMR 4 5K MMR on the European server And the question is, are Benchies imbalanced or does Anamin suck? All right, here we go. Are Masters player Adamin struggling with the Cloak Benchies, but not just regular cloak banshees, they are speed banshees Now, the speed banshee is one of those units that is actually quite tricky to deal with because like he mentions, stalkers can't quite catch up with it You have to often play base defense for a long time Very often in the early game, you also play a build opener, build order, which isn't optimal against mass banshee, because usually you expect, well, some type of bio play. So a lot of the time, Protos players get called of guard, then they need to make some type of response and they need to adapt in the moment and that can be very difficult to do if you don't already have kind of a plan previously thought out in your head He also mentioned the ProxyRex and honestly I'm not going to blame him for taking damage against the Proxxiaxxx is really difficult to play against You need a very tight response often and it feels so hard to not take any damage Good control by the way out of this Terran here Actually just microing this Reaper properly It is so nice to see some higher level replays where both players are controlling. their units with, well, in a somewhat adequate way Bunker isn't going to finish, and as there's no extra SUV coming across the map, I guess that this is going to get stopped the moment of first Adept or Stalker pops out There's going to be an adept Now, second assimilator is rather delayed for no real reason We see there's plenty of money in the bank around right now In this type of scenario, I also wouldn't completely mind having a battery in the main or the natural So at least one of your bases is free against the threat of two jumping in reapers or even three jumping in reapers That way you can focus all of your defenses in one base. Right now, if these two reapers would end up going into the main base right now, there would be nothing there to defend, and you'd probably end up losing three, four extra workers and put yourself in a, well, quite frankly, terrible spot The only reason why the Protos player is not in that bad of a spot after losing three workers is because the Terran played a very inefficient build order focusing mainly on gas mining A lot of gas mining is not actually that helpful for Taryn It delays our command center a lot while barely increasing the timing of that initial star port And in this case, the Taryn kind of forgets its starport as well It's getting supply blocked. So I honestly completely agree with what Adamin said initially He said, my defense against the proxy barracks wasn't good, but it didn't really matter because I will still ahead And this is a very fair characterization of the game so far He has a faster nexus than his opponent has a command center The command center is on the high ground There's no follow-up threat yet I mean, what's it going to be? A Benji walking across the map? Sorry, a mine walking across the map No, it can be So, yeah, I actually really like this position for the Protols The only problem I have is with how bad the Protles is at spending his money He's floating 600 minerals, 125 gas right now. A third base could be on the way already We could be getting extra gases in the natural if you're not sure yet if you want to take a third base I can completely understand that as well, by the way If you don't see a Command Center landing on your opponent's natural, like he saw it now with his Adept It was flying so it doesn't show up here in the, what you call it, in the fog of war But basically he knows there's an expansion But if you don't know it, I can understand why you don't want to take a third base You don't want to be on three bases while your opponent is on one base all inning you. That makes a lot of sense Ideally, what you want right now is your main priority should be gathering a little bit of information Keeping a unit on your opponent's side of the map perhaps, trying to figure out what is going on Because quite frankly, Adamin is a little bit blind He is going for a standard-ish setup with blink, a couple of gateways, robotic facility, so it's going to be safe against most things But if you're not entirely sure what's happening, I really wouldn't mind just getting a quick battery over here, maybe even a battery in the main base. keeping one unit on your opponent's side of the map and it allows to AC if your opponent is moving out you can see it with that unit that is over here on the map so you can respond with perhaps more batteries if necessary if you don't see a move out you can perhaps be a little bit greedier and with the battery in the main base are a bit safer if it's going to be just an initial one banshee or if it's like a marine drop or even something like a helion drop so you see adamant doesn't even have very good vision on the right side of his main base luckily for adamin it is none of that and our Terran player is playing an extremely unorthodox build order. This is double Starport cloak Benchy with a single tank Now, if this had been spotted, I'm pretty sure that Adaman just could have walked across the map at any point with like 10 stalkers and won the game But because it hasn't been spotted, he can't really do that Well, he could still be doing it blind, but that would be risky in case it isn't a build order like this I like that this observer is going across the map And you know what? I even like that this observer didn't go across the map immediately You could say, well, Karen, that is stupid You want to scout as fast as possible. Yes, but you also want to keep detection at home for as long as possible You're playing against the Terran that stayed on one base for very long and thus probably has some type of tech coming in, keeping an observer at home in case of armory widow mine drops, which means that the widow mines become invisible, or in case of double-cloked Benchy, having that observer there is absolutely not a luxury, but it is a must It is a necessity And I kind of like that Adamin decided to keep this one at home for a little bit longer Now, that could just be because he's slow as sending it out. But if that was a decision, that was a very responsible and mature decision, I would say Very, very responsible and mature Something that's less responsible and mature is the fact that we're banking up infinite amounts of chronobo boost We're getting a robo bay right now and blink finishing up Not a huge fan of a blind Robo Bay Very often, it doesn't have much of a purpose this late Like, basically what I'm trying to say is you're either going to get it earlier than this to blindly get into Colossi, or if you're already getting it this late, just wait until your observer scouts what your opponent is doing. And then you can pretty much, then you can pretty much decide, hey, do I want charged Templar Archives at six gateways? Go for like a big charge Archon composition, or do I want to go into those Colossi or perhaps even start with disruptors? some very niche scenarios, which I can't really think of right now where you'd want to start with one disruptor The Observer is going to fly into a turret here, which is Oh! Oh? Two turrets Now, it could make fun of you here for losing the Observer, but I'm not going to do that, because the situation you find yourself in is truly unique. Your opponent decided to not just build one turret, which is extremely uncommon at this timing in this matchup, but two turrets at the same time Your reaction speed to that first turret was even very good You pulled your observer away immediately and it only died because for whatever God-forsaken reason, there was a second turn there, which makes no sense This doesn't reflect poorly upon you It reflects poorly upon your opponent This be a little bit as if you were walking on the sidewalk and out of nowhere a clown on a unicycle throws a water balloon at you. You catch the water balloon, throw it back, hit him square in the face, he falls off his unicycle, and as you watch that happen, you get hit by a water balloon in the back of your head, by a second clown on a unicycle I mean, can I really blame you for getting hit by that second water balloon? No, I would just merely be impressed by you catching that first one And that is the same here with this observer So yeah, basically, I'm just impressed by you Keep throwing those water balloons, my friend However, you are lacking some information right now and as a result, well, okay, a little bit of theory. I don't expect you to completely understand this or know this, but let's just look at what you actually scouted Despite not getting any major information, we still can gather some clues, right? Your opponent is building turrets Now, what are turrets? Turrets are buildings that cost only minerals What units cost minerals? Bio units are very mineral focus That means if you see a lot of turrets and you see three turrets over here, see a bit of a depot wall, you can almost always call that is going to be Mac in this type of case, or at least with a bunch of tanks there Now, you don't know if there's going to be starboard units with it, but you can kind of call them Mac. And in that case, you could consider canceling your robotics bay, throwing down a Templar Archives and starting charge, or you could let your robotics bay finish, but just not get any units from your robotics facility right now, and then adding a couple of extra gateways, going into charge, still throwing down the Templar Archives, and kind of continue that route So even if you don't get the full information with the little information that you have been offered, you could still make somewhat of an educated guess Now, once again, it is difficult to make an educated guess like that if you're not a top top player Maybe you just don't completely understand That's completely fine I'm not going to blame you for that. second forge, I think these are decent calls This Ropter I'm not a huge fan of It's not going to be very useful against high tank counts usually But once again, I understand it's still better than starting a colossian thermal lens So I'm okay with that I'm really okay with that Now, this is an uncommon move, so I don't expect you to have a good response against this Okay There's two banshees coming in towards your natural and then these two benches are either heading towards your third base or heading towards your main base, depending on what the taran ones Four Benchy attack squad, seven minutes and 31 seconds into the game I honestly haven't seen this in like five years. So having a mediocre response or being surprised, that's okay You have a blind cannon already here You pulled workers away That is good You are taking a little bit of damage here in your main base, but once again, I wouldn't have expected the first two Benchies I also wouldn't have expected Benchy 3 and 4 for sure Now, this is a little bit more painful because now you did see that there were banshees in your main and you're just not responding whatsoever Yeah This started kind of fine This actually started kind of fine You know, for the first two banshees, you could almost say, like, that was, imagine you're walking on the sidewalk. I'm just picking out a random comparison here, okay? Imagine you're walking on the sidewalk and all of a sudden a clown shows up on a unicycle And this clown out of nowhere starts throwing water balloons at you Those were the first two Benjies over here And you catch these water balloons and throw it back at the clown You hit him square in the face Fantastic move Now, if you then get hit in the back of the head by a water balloon, by a second clown on a unicycle, am I going to blame you for that? No, of course not Who could have expected one clown, let alone two clowns on a unicycle throwing water balloons? I'm not going to blame you for that. However, if then the second clown gets off the unicycle and peas on your leg and you don't respond to that, yes, your legs deserve to be wet And that is what happened here You now have wet legs You lost way more workers than you ever should have And there's no real reason for that Your initial response to these was good Your initial response to the ones in the main wasn't as great But then once he flies towards your third base, you knew you had no cannon here the only base that was in danger of actually losing, being without detection, was your third base. That should have been the first priority once you saw the Benchies had towards the main base, or once you saw the Benchie in the main base, is getting detection to the final base that doesn't have it yet Now, now, we are in a situation where you have a very big anti-air army, which is good because you're playing against Benchies, you kind of want to get the confirmation that this is indeed multiple Starport You're not getting that Personally, I'm not a huge fan of that A disruptor here Okay Now, the first disruptor I understood Okay? The first disruptor I understood You didn't know what type of position you were in You had absolutely no clue what type of position you were in. But now you do know what type of position you're in You're in a position where your opponent is building a lot of banshees And I can't, you know, I can't flame you for not being great at adapting within a game It is a difficult game and it's difficult to think and play at the same time Maybe you do not know the perfect response here I played amateur football, for example, for a little over 16 years and sometimes people would pass the ball to me and I just didn't know what to do with it You feel panicked, you shoot it over the sidelines It's not the end of the world, but it's annoying. This is a similar situation for you, except rather than shooting the ball over the sidelines, you're pooping yourself by building a disruptor A disruptor is a high highly specialized unit that has a purpose against groups of units that are very small, so many can fit in your purification nova and you can explode them If you just confirmed that there's no such unit, no very small units, why are you getting a second disruptor? It doesn't make a lot of sense There's basically no unit that would be worse right now than the disruptor, except maybe the colossi could be worse, or if you add like four centuries but the Disruptor is a very bad call at this point, and I'm not a fan of it. We continue Banshees moving in towards your main base. Now you have zero map vision once again around the map. This has been an issue the entire game already for you from start to finish. I mentioned have a unit over here to see your opponent move out. But now that you know that Banshees are around, you might want to start building some Pylons around the map so you can get some early spotters on. Your Disruptor gets sniped here. Your opponent actually doing you a favor. like he shows you how bad the disruptor is against mass Benchie and as a result you hopefully will not build any extra this is a good call observer speed i really like that call now whenever you do see high benchy numbers you always kind of have to think what is the real weakness of the Benchie and if you think a little bit about it it is the inability of the Benchie to shoot up it has a range attack but it can shoot straight it can only shoot down which means that units like phoenixus void rays Carriers, Tempest, motherships are all fantastic against it because you can chase them And specifically, the phoenix is great because the phoenix is faster than the banshee. And with observer speed, you can catch the banshees always That means that your opponent's entire infrastructure would be made useless by legit getting out three to four banshees That is literally all that it would, or benches, three to four phoenixes That is all it would take. you could just stay at home with stalkers and go hunting for banshees with your phoenixes until you max out then you attack with your main army a move across the map and hopefully win the game now you haven't quite figured it out yet and that is okay um instead you're going across the map despite knowing that there's banshees in your main base destroying absolutely everything so you you kill one base and your opponent well takes out every single pylon in your main base Is it an interesting engagement as well? Holy crap That was a bad engagement for you Oh, the Disruptor, actually taking out more zealots than SEVs there as well Great unit in this type of scenario This was a terrible engagement. And also the actual call wasn't great Sure, you took out a base and a planetary that was defending the natural But this is like being happy that you've been burrowing the lawnmower of your neighbor for the past three months This feels really good until you realize that it's winter so you don't need to mow the grass and as a form of payment your neighbor has been stealing your newspaper for the past three weeks So I'm not entirely sure if this was the trade that you wanted to take Actually, I am entirely sure that this is a trade that you didn't want to take You're rebuilding the robotics facility I'm not rebuilding You can just repower it as well It's a little bit cheaper. God, I hope your house never loses power Because if your house loses power, rather than just fixing the electricity, you might accidentally just buy a new house This one is done Smack it on the back of the house Out of energy Absolutely ridiculous Six more benches on the way Two more just idling over here Double four just You have a good upgrades Your opponent has no upgrades Invested in how many? Twelve benches already? No more 29 benches already already Couldn't spare the money for a single ship weapons upgrade That is the Terran logic that we're so fond of And I bet that if the Terran would have lost this, he would have complained about the weakness of the Benchie. They don't deal enough damage Made Never heard of upgrades? You might want to get them Might want to get them Cannon unpowered Observer speed is so good against this It's an, it's absolutely a necessity Benchies are so fast, though they outspeed observers with speed, but if you do them in combination with phoenixes, they're usually good enough to take them out If you really want detection that sticks, you can also get an oracle So you can just revelate them and then it sticks on them, right? The revelation of the Oracle Once again, this move out is just, it's silly You're, like, what are you trying to achieve? What, like, you're working against an army that scales terribly terrible scaling. If you get any type of air unit, this army sucks You want him to max out on banshees and you want to max out yourself as well That is an ideal situation here for the toss Just want to stay at home, max out 70 workers, you're all good What you could do, send a couple of zealots across the map Just harass, see which bases are being taken Funny thing, a lot of people don't realize this, but if there is a planetary somewhere and you send in zealots and you shift click on SCVs, and it's just a planetary without any additional defense, the zealots will kill a lot of SCVs People don't realize this, because usually planetaries don't come alone. You know, they have a little bit of baggage with them, like a couple of bio units, a ghost, two mines, a tank in the back These bases don't have any of that So despite them being planetaries, you could still harass somewhat successfully It's not like these zealots are contributing a whole lot into your chase of the Benchie right now If anything, they might just be blocking your stock You're also starting to float kind of ridiculous amounts of money at this point You're floating, well, I wish I could do math, but more than 4,000,000 resources or so 2 7-ishk in minerals and well at this point, 2K in gas That's a lot That actually is a lot You're getting a fifth base. I like your willingness to continue expanding, but you just don't have enough units right now to deal with this Finally we see the Stargates come down I think this is a very good call It's a call that should have been made a long time ago But even without these Stargates, your defense could have been a lot better had you just stayed at home a bit more and actually prepared for the possibility of an attack This is something that I quite often notice in players that aren't complete garbage, but, you know, still not the absolute top, is that they kind of hope that their opponent forgets about their harassment It's like we're a Masters League right now It's probably not going to happen. This guy is not going to be like, oh, 12 benches, let me just idle them in the dead space No, he's probably going to be using them And every single time you move out, pretending like the benches don't exist, you're going to pay a price for that And that is exactly what is happening in this game You move out, you're paying a price You move out, you're paying a price Now, first phoenixes are coming out, and the moment the Terrant sees a phoenix here, his immediate reaction should be to transition, whether that's going to be into viking, Okay, yeah, that doesn't make any sense Maybe Maybe Viking Benchy Who knows? Well, not without ship weapons, I guess You should immediately start transitioning. Okay, Fusion Corps You know what? I don't mind this at all It's going to be Battle Cruiser The battle cruiser is actually fantastic against Phoenixes Because, you know, lots of armor on the BC You can Yamato Phoenixes as well Great I love that Great call out of the Tarant here, but you still have some Benchies to deal with You're still floating a lot of money Despite all of your failures in this game, I wouldn't want to say you're winning, but you are winning I know this sounds stupid because you're losing buildings left, right and center, but you have a massive bank You're insanely far ahead in workers still And the only assets that your opponent has are these 20 benches. And these two phoenixes basically make these benches useless or are not completely useless I mean, they're still going to kill some stuff because two phoenix aren't fast, but eventually they will die Look how fast it goes Just with two phoenixes Imagine you had four phoenixes Or even better, five Or you could even have gotten six or maybe seven phoenixes You could literally just add more phoenixes and it would be better for you And then somewhere it starts dropping off at like a nine or ten You don't want to get more than ten phoenixes Although against 20 benches, maybe you do want to get See, beautiful stuff He just threw away 20 Benches because he knew their time was running out. Yes, he gets the Nexus, but you have freaking 6 3K in the bank, my friend This game is completely over You actually won at this point Right now, the game has ended All you need to do is realize it Spend your money, you could I was going to look for the word of 10 I was going to say triple expand, but then times 10 I don't actually know the word Hex size, I think Is that five? Octa expand, that's eight That's where my knowledge stops Hamster will make a witty annotation, making fun of my lack of knowledge, calling me an idiot And then he'll also put the correct thing there immediately Why can I think of that? Triple. Anyway, yeah, you're still extremely far ahead Your opponent has no supply, no workers You're being outmined right now because your opponent has more bases that actually are alive You lost, well, you're actually only mining, long distance mining of a single nexus And short, short distance mining on that same nexus with like four patches So yeah, you're not getting that much stuff I like this counterattack I think that's a good call Now that you have the phoenix is out, you're safe at home And does this type of counterattack? Makes a creptone of sense Your opponent goes across the map Do you have any production? 4 gateways And you tap out without Gigi here Now, I'm not saying that you were winning this game. But you definitely weren't losing it Do you have recall available? Oh, you can't see that Let me go back So recall is available You have two phoenixes, four gateways Where's the fourth one? Oh, maybe this is the four Here, down here About to get a fifth as well You have one Stargate still producing You could recall this Now, it doesn't look like a whole lot of stalkers, but you have 10 stalkers with plus three These BCs have no upgrades whatsoever They blinked in, and they don't have Yamato either Sure, there's more BCs on the way, but you have an infinite bank. The moment you see this, the BCs come in, you could throw down four stargates, a fleet beacon, get a fifth and a sixth base, and still be floating 4K You could continuously be warping Starwalkers to stay alive until you get Tempest out And don't forget, you're going to be completely outmining your opponent pretty darn soon If you just had recalled here, I think you were I think if you give me the situation against a top tarrant, I think I would win this I think this is a winning position for Toss Surely, with this much in the bank How far are these next BCs? Okay, so two BCs are 30 seconds away that's like a warp in and a half. You're definitely going to defend this if you micro well You have four more stalkers, soon to be five stalkers to warp in, all with plus three You have so much money I think it's a win Also, you can keep the zealots here to target down the SEVs with the trick I spoke about earlier I think you didn't lose this game I really don't think you lost this game I think you won it and you left without realizing You also surely did not watch the replay or you would not have sent it to me complaining about Benchies. The funny thing is that within this replay and within the form, you mentioned that you believe that phoenixes are the counter and Phoenixes are the correct counter You figured it out already You even saw it in this game as the moment you built three Phoenixes, you managed a literally hard counter, like 26 Benchies at the same time That is how good the Phoenix is against the Benchie And that's why we never see this type of mess Benchie play in pro level play You figured it out You don't actually believe that the Benchie is in Ballet is imbalanced I don't believe the Benchie is imbalanced either I don't even think you suck that much I mean, you sucked at a lot of points. You made a lot of bad decisions But I think you played probably slightly better than your opponent and it shows in this situation as well You have a very big bank You just don't have any grit You have no staying power If you were in Rocky, we only would have had Rocky one And that would have been it And it would have ended halfway It would have been a terrible movie No one would have watched it This is not it I say this is not imbalanced and you do not suck This is an invalid form Boom! I don't know what else to do with it Invalid I don't want it Just stay in games and win them when you deserve to win. You played okay for this level You played about as good as your opponent Maybe slightly better and you're in this position your opponent had a bad strategy and eventually you found a counter I don't understand why you would send me this replay I just don't understand this All right Well, I guess that's it? Is that the first one I've ever made invalid? I think so Well, thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed this confusing episode of Is It Inba or Do I Suck? When you're walking outside, be sure to be aware of any clowns on unicycles with water balloons It is an absolute pandemic of clowns on unicycles, throwing water balloons as people. So I want all of you to stay safe, stay inside, and wear your water balloon protective headgear when you're going outside All right, that's going to be it for me today Thanks so much for watching And I'll see you all next time, I hope And send me some IOTUS with the form below You can do that and fill it in, replay in there as well On the new maps, I like having those Ciao, chow Thank you."

        "text": "Dear Harsdom, my complaint is about carriers and the mothership Those units are broken My opponent opened the game with a cannon rush Maybe I overreacted pulling all of my SCVs, but I managed to stop him After that, I tried to push his natural expansion, but he had cannons in defense And by the time my tank arrived, he had already four void rays, which I couldn't stop with my army because of shield batteries and cannons Then he attacked with his Void Rays and took one of mine CC, but he was wasn't a problem I had more bases than him and I had the map control, so I tried to harass him with Vikings and Marines. I ended up doing a good job, I guess, but when the carriers were too much, I had to retreat In this game I thought I was ahead from the start to my opponent's last push I had better economy, better map control, and overall I think I played better than him But anyway, in his last push, his carriers, in combination with the mothership, were unstoppable by my forces Maybe I lacked in upgrades, or maybe I just wasn't able to micro properly Please tell me, are Skaitos imba, or do I suck? Name, Vida Lorso, Race, Terran, League Platinum at 2 9K MMR, and the server is Europe. This very Italian sounding name, Vita Lorsso, asked the most important question, and that is Are Skaitos Inba, or do I suck? And we're about to find out and investigate All right, and that leads us to the actual game Pencroft as our Prodos player here on Tropical Sacrifice Well, in the bottom left, we have the man the mid the legend Vital Orso Look at that Looks like some Halo figure over here But I feel like this might also be like some StarCraft dude Halo and StarCraft share a lot of similarities Both of them, I believe, are in space It's pretty big Forge, right, it was a cannon rush He mentioned this in his imbalance complaint form. What did he say exactly again? Maybe I overreacted pulling all of my SCE of my SEVs, but I managed to stop him Now, when it comes to stopping cannon rushes, I like to say rather an overreaction than an underreaction It's a little bit as being very, you know, being very scared of someone's dodgy behavior when you're in like a train or something like that, you know, if there's a guy screaming, I'm going to stab you, I'm going to stab you Then I rather have you leave the train at the next station, then try and find out if he actually means it or not So oftentimes, if your life is on the line, overreacting is better than underreacting. I almost ate my own tongue there That would be quite the overreaction to having a bit of a dry throat But once again, that would have been good I should have eaten my tongue Mistakes happen, though So, yeah, this actually went pretty well He takes out the probe I mean, he pulls his workers off the line, but it's not that big of a deal It really isn't You lose like maybe 150 minerals or so, but you completely deny this cannon rush And don't forget, the investment in a cannon rush is way more than just 150 minerals. Not only, I just want to make this clear, not only is it just the money you actually invest in the cannon rush, but it's also kind of the lost opportunity of putting any type of pressure early on as a protos player Your gateway is delayed and thus your tech is delayed Your defensive forces are later Any type of tech, like a dark shrine or an Oracle will be way later as well So it is more than just the actual minerals, but even mineral-wise, the forge, and the aggressive cannon are already 250 minerals So you can pull 15 SEVs for, you know, 10, 10, 12 seconds, and you'll probably be okay. A little bit longer, especially if there's like a second pylon and this type of stuff shows up This is actually a perfect response right now You have the Marine setting two SUVs to the left cannon, three SUVs to the right cannon Oh, Protos does cancel it That's actually a high level move for a platinum game Not gonna lie Actually canceling the cannons and everything cannons and everything Look at that Absolute triarts Now, from this point on, there's two things that I would like to see One is an orbital command, and two would be a Reaper here. Now, the reason why I say a Reaper is because very, very often, Protos players, they build a pylon on the low ground to get a couple of cannons so they can safely expand Without cannons, they can't really expand They might be against like a couple of Marines or the Terran can build a bunker here and basically deny their natural base forever and ever However, a Reaper also, forces a cannon in the main mineral line And a single cannon also isn't quite enough Because a single cannon, imagine you put it over here in the middle, it would not cover this spot or this spot, which means that a Reaper could hold position here and deny mining on the outside mineral patches. Now, I don't really imagine Pencroft, the platinum player that he would pull away these five workers and let them mine from somewhere else and properly manage that So he probably would end up losing a couple of workers for free The Reaper also provides free scouting, which once again, is very tricky to get at the moment there are two cannons on the high ground waiting to kill you So potential for damage, free scouting, all of that good jazz basically Orbital command, it's a little bit late I think it was about a minute late over here, maybe like 50 seconds And that's actually kind of a big deal for the economy of Vidalur. The reason for that is because with an orbital command you can throw down a mule A mule gets between 200 and 225 minerals in its lifetime lifetime of a mu is 64 seconds, and every 64 seconds, I think it's 63 and a half seconds, you can throw down a new mu So basically what I'm saying is every 60 seconds that you're delaying your orbital command costs you about 200 to 225 minerals So it's extremely important that you get it as quickly as possible If you delay it by two minutes for no reason whatsoever, that's already an entire command center that you're missing So far, he's missed it, I think, for like about a minute. And right now when natural is also not building one So that is a little bit painful And this is really also the only reason why usually Terran is even in income while being behind in workers Protos of course has the chronobost ability, which allows them to get more workers than the Terran But that is fine because a mule counts for, what is it, like three and a half to four SCVs, depending on a far or a close-by mineral patch where the mule is mining So six Marines are going to march across the map You already know that there's two cannons here these two marines are going to be completely useless and will be incapable of dealing any damage whatsoever You already know this. There's no way you don't know this You can poke up here You just got the basically the information confirmed that he didn't cancel these two cannons I don't think you have to sacrifice a Marine for that Then again, your opponent also, I think just gifted you two probes total here I think he sent one in before as well Very, very cool Tank is coming out right now Once again, this is just not enough to break onto a high ground I'd much rather have you wait for a meta fact with a reactor here Okay, very odd build order I'm not going to focus too much on that I'm really not that interested in improving your build order. You can do that by yourself by just looking at any replay, but getting a reactor at this time on your starboard, especially while you already have a factory with a tech lab, is completely useless You simply do not have the gas income for it Still don't don't have an orbital command here So at this point, I think you're down like four to 600 minerals or so where you should have been You're still ahead Don't get me wrong You're still out mining your opponent in a big way because your opponent is mining a crap ton of gas Mining gas cuts big into your mineral eco And minerals are the only thing that increases your actual economy. Everything that increases your eco can be paid for indeed by minerals Gas, command centers, depots, SEVs, all that good jazz Two more gases on the way you relatively okay call Metafax is here right now, could provide you a high ground vision but rather than doing that you're just kind of idling here for at least a little bit longer Okay, here we go Somewhat of a good move You are in range of a cannon, so it's not absolutely brilliant One tank gets taken out Matter of fact is almost dead as well This has not been the greatest micro Actually this is probably the worst you could have microed this situation. I'm not quite sure how it happened, but you managed to lose two tanks and Metafak and all you did was deal a little bit of damage on one void, right? If, okay, I'm very big on people kind of, you know, playing, playing to their own power So if your strength is macro, then I'd focus a lot on that If your weakness is micro and attacking into cannon positions, I would not do that again would suggest at this point you pick up these eight marines, drop them in towards the main base, continue macroing at home, then the moment stim finishes or before stim finishes, you scout with them to see what's going and maybe you kill a couple of workers. That's really all you're going to be doing I would not recommend going for the same trick again It didn't work before It's probably not going to end up working now So it was just my humble suggestion And this guy has balls of steel as well Sends four void race across the map while he's being practically two and a half base all-in I also would like to stress, by the way, that there's absolutely no need for our Terran player to actually be on the other side of the map right now He's up an entire base, probably has better infrastructure, has more workers as well. Technically, you could just be preparing for a two-base all-in that has to be coming, or you can just deny your opponent's third base forever You can just keep a unit on each third base In the moment it gets taken, you start moving across the map So I wouldn't have mind that having a couple of extra units at home Then again, I don't think anyone could have really predicted this move, so I'm not going to blame you for it You lose a command center This still wasn't an orbital, by the way So that's like what? Like legit, like a thousand minerals that you've missed with lacking mules This hasn't turned into an orbital yet either. I'm not quite sure how long this has been done But it's also been done for at least 45 seconds or so It's not been great At least you're going to get these void rays, I guess for whatever reason, Pencroft decides that damaging the star port to 517 HP is more important than flying away and perhaps keeping these very expensive units alive There's a response you build five turrets in mediocre positions The building placement and the order in which you build the buildings hasn't been brilliant so far You get a second reactor on a star port You continue Viking production Despite going for a big bio army, you still only have a single metavac. These are all the types of decisions that I'm usually not a huge fan of Okay If you're planning on going for a bunch of bio, which you obviously were because you had two wrecks, now you get a second starport I would say get a couple of metavac, so they actually have some real sustain to them There's absolutely nothing right now that could kill these 22 Marines. I almost believe at this point you could just actually walk up the ramp and kill your opponent but what you could also do is fly forward with two Vikings try to take out I can't believe you actually got that carrier I was going to make fun of you for this move but it worked out so then I can't really make fun of it that was a very good trade that actually was a very good trade oh Vikings still alive as well I love that you're flying away from one interceptor It's like, oh, the two carriers earlier was fine with the two Vikings, but now there's a single interceptor left We decided to move the Viking back and actually let it die. That was a mistake You also have been supply blocked at 78, 78 for the past, I think, minute and a half Have you even produced anything? I love the focus here on the drop Like I understand that you really want to micro this well and you probably do have the opportunity to kill your opponent it's not the most important thing Like you've been supply block now for almost an entire minute And StarCraft 2 is a lot about prioritizing often And what you're doing at this moment is rearranging your shoelace collection in alphabetical order while your house is on fire. I'm sure there are some sneaker freaks out there that would kind of understand it, but I don't think I have enough empathy to truly get behind that decision More Vikings across the map The only reason why you're capable of producing by the way is because you're losing units, not because you've been building depots At any point during this you could have continued producing workers or build depots, hello We're landing and we're going up in the sky Maybe land another time You show it off one more time real good No, okay This also is an interesting decision You brought the marauder upstairs with all the marines that can actually shoot up are downstairs Now you're fighting into a super battery. Ah! You can't see the super battery What's healing him? What's happening here? This has to be the most confusing 14 seconds of his life He's like, man, the mothership I'm attacking it with four Vikings No wonder he thinks the mothership is really broken I already was confused how he could complain about the mothership being too good But it all goes back to the super battery being invisible And Vita Lorso and not really Once again, he's like, man, this guy has insane shield regeneration I can't remember it being that good Once again, we get a What do you call this? The assault mode, I think it's called of the Viking Once again, just microing his heart out while floating 1,300 minerals. Now, don't get me wrong Protos player also is floating 3K minerals and 1,800 gas, which is also not brilliant But what you are doing is definitely not brilliant You're way, you should be way out mining him You're still doubling his income, which honestly is fine You haven't built any upgrades out of these eBay You haven't built any upgrades or any armories even yet for the Vikings Now you're going to lose out your army The one thing that is true about the carrier, and that a lot of people dislike as well, is that it's often harder to micro against than it is to micro width. So the carrier can a-move, and your units, if they aim move, will target down the interceptors, which is a win for the carrier often, because if you kill the interceptors, the carriers go back home, recharge on interceptors, and then they go again Now, if you actually make an army of mass marine and you're fighting against pure carrier, that usually isn't much of an issue because Marines actually are better than carriers, especially with good upgrades, and if they're being healed, maybe you get some ghosts with it as well, and it's all good. But if you're building Vikings as the main counter, there's one thing that I expect you to do, and that is to properly right-click on the carriers so that they're all targeting the carrier and not the interceptor Because every time you kill a carrier, the interceptors automatically die with it as well If you have a massive Marine army, very often you can just kill the interceptors because your damage output is so ridiculously good And once again, you're going in with the Vikings By continuously attacking up this ramp, by the way, this is kind of funny So you wanted to stay in control this game and you wanted to put on a lot of pressure. But sometimes the best way to put on pressure is just by standing outside of your opponent's base and not allowing him to ever take a third. By actively pushing into his main base, into the Shield Battery, he gave your opponent a chance to hold with enough units and gave your opponent a chance to basically get a Nexus out and start three Photon Cannons as well, which never would have been possible if you just idled your entire army in this exact location. So this once again, it kind of shows that putting on constant pressure often isn't the greatest thing. And you also mentioned map control a couple of times in your imbalance complaint form as a thing that is very useful. But map control, it isn't an actual resource It's not like being up in supply It only has real value if you can use it well Like if you have complete map control, but then with that map control, you just boost map Metafax into your opponent's cannons, like the map control did nothing for you And despite you having map control and having good map vision even because you're spreading out Marines, I don't feel like you've actually been using it for good You've just been, you've just had it and that's it Like there's no real point Don't forget, it's not about the size of the wave, but it's about the motion of the ocean. Vikings attacking the carriers and up and down and up and now attacking the interceptors and then the carrier This reminds me a little bit of my uncle Ronnie My uncle Ronnie has a convertible car and if you go for a drive with Uncle Ronnie in his convertible car, the rooftop is coming off No matter the weather It can be hailing There can be rain Uncle Ronnie I'm getting wet Kevin, I have a convertible I feel like you have the same issue here with your Vikings You just want to show off that they have two different modes You know, they can fly, they can land, they can fly, they can land. If your opponent, however, has three or four carriers, it's probably the best thing just to keep them in the air Just like if it's raining, Uncle Ronnie, we keep the roof up So our heads are covered That's what the roof was invented for They figure this out in caveman times No one cares about your convertible car So now with all of this behind us, you manage to give your opponent a third base, lost all of your Vikings, realize that you need upgrades as well after seeing your opponent going for upgrades I'm not quite sure if people in platinum click your opponent's units. If you click your opponents usually, and you don't have a weird replay overlay like I have, you usually see the, you know, you can see the upgrade numbers on your opponent's units Oh, there we go again Yes Of course, put them on the floor again There we go I can't wait to tell my uncle that he That I know a new friend Yes, he's an Italian, but he's a great guy I bet you and him will get a long grade, Ronnie Unbelievable Okay, four more Vikings on the way These are in the air Do these have Stim? Yeah, no combat No upgrade still, despite of being two e-base It's just a very interesting game altogether. Oh, Vikings accidentally got found on the ground again But honestly, how could Vita Lorsel have known that there would be more carriers? After so far in the entire game, there have already been three zealots and only, what is it, 12 other air units This must have come as a massive surprise for Vita Lorsel And the result losing six Vikings, or what was it, eight Vikings for free, and now losing this fight because he lost eight Vikings for free Another thing I would like to draw the attention to is the money that Vita is the money that Vira Lorso has And I often say this about Zirk, if you have trouble spending your money, there's absolutely no shame in building a macro hatch whatsoever. It's actually a good thing, if you have too much money to spend your money on a macro hatch It's the same with Terran If you have too much money, spend it on more production so you can more easily produce. So the beauty of extra production is that you can just spend so fast extra and extra and it saves me from many situations in my life as well, three hours later and that kids is how a macro hatch helped me survive a jaguar attack in Belgium huh where was I right extra starports I actually kind of like it that we already have these three extra starports here it feels somewhat good you can continuously be building Vikings if you want to which apparently is definitely what a good friend Vita Lorsa wants to because he's also getting the ship weapons as well as the vehicle plating upgrades Now, like I mentioned before, I'm not necessarily a huge fan of Vikings as a counter to carriers. Ooh, look at that Extra Star Porsche Beautiful stuff Beautiful stuff It's actually lacking a little bit in gas He's really pushing it now with the extra Star Wars Okay, I'm a big fan of it, but getting three extra Also, queuing one up is a big move It's not a big move It's a mistake It's anything but a big move Ship weapons level two. no real vision on your opponent but it doesn't matter in case you could have like a Marine over here Marine over here Marine over here Of course that would be the only possible if you actually had Marines What is this scan Does he not realize there's also potential for a base here I'll say it's not like he's under some heavy pressure Like he could just send an SUV over Once again a scan is extremely expensive A scan is practically the equivalent of a mule Like, it's just as much energy It's 200 minerals you just wasted It's really not cheap Like, it's legitimately expensive No memes Ship weapons level 2 More Vikings still coming in. The problem with going for a full Viking Battle Cruiser composition is that you might just You need a lot more gas You need to saturate every single gas you have or you're just going to be floating minerals Okay, here we go There's a fight Look at that, beautiful Shutes the interceptors once, loses five Vikings Shoots the interceptors another time No target fire, no target fire Okay, now we get target fire on the mothership Mother ship dies, as every single Viking has gone down Very nice Now, this was beautiful The funny thing here is, is that this actually showcase the power of carrier in a lower level game Both of these players literally just A moved And in this case, the carriers win. Because against the carrier, like I mentioned before, you need to actually right click on the carrier to kill them rather than go for the interceptors So you could say that the only thing or the only thing that Vidal Orso had to do more here was the right click or shift click on individual units 7 clicks is what it would have been Is this 7? No, this is 6 6 clicks Just a right click on 6 different units That was all the micro that I've asked in this entire game for Vita Lorso Literally all of it That's the only thing I would have wanted And he didn't do that And that's not good If that is literally the only mic. At this point the game is extremely over There is Well, you have, I guess, the production over here But there's still triple carriers coming out as well I'm not too interested in watching every single building burn down I'm just going to speed this up a little bit More turrets as well I love that his initial instinct was to defend this base, which had three SUVs mining, and throw entire turret rings around it Turret rings also are not actually that useful If you want tourists to be more useful, you have to cluster them, because then more can attack at the same time The reason why we often build turret rings is against things like prisms. So if you're afraid of a prism going into your main base, you can build a turret here, a turret here, a turret here, a turret here, and a turret here, and then the prism can't get in But if you're fighting against an air army that does air attacks, you want all the anti-air to be as clustered as possible Otherwise, in this case, the carriers can just attack turrets here on the right side and then slowly move over to different sides, while only a small portion of the turrets at each time are shooting Yeah, this game is actually completely over It's a late game battlecruiser transition, which funnily enough also could have worked this game. Look, against carriers, if it's just a pure carrier army, there's about 50 things that Taryn can do Mass Viking works, mass battle cruiser works, mass marine works, mine marine works, marine ghost works, marine mind ghost works, anything basically but rallying Vikings in, what were they called again, salt mode into your opponent would have worked, especially given the eco advantage that Vita Lorso has had this game And I'm actually, I'm also a bit surprised that he complained about the carriers and the mothership equally What in the world is he doing here? So it's flying the orbital away This is one of the things that I never quite understand And it tends to be Terence the most. But if you just played a game where you were up, legit four, four five bases and you couldn't win the game being up four bases and up 35 or 40 supply How do you imagine you're going to win the game by saving this command center while being down 130 supply? It just never made any sense to me whatsoever And you could say he's just angry and he wants to waste his opponent's time, but he's also wasting his own time So by doing that, you're basically saying that your time is less valuable than your opponent's time because only then would it be a good trade You're basically calling yourself a loser if you pull a move like this. And you could say, well, he just flows his buildings away and then there's nothing But right now he has 100 APM This is more than his average How is it possible that Vita Lorso is currently doing more than he did on average in the entire game? I don't understand that This is the point where you should be doing nothing anymore because you're done dead It makes no sense It's over, my friend You have lost It's time to leave Get into the next game You know, get that respawn button going I just don't understand this type of thinking Impressive No, what's impressive was your ability to stay in after a game finished five minutes ago That's the most impressive thing All right. Let me take a quick look at that balance complaint again the mothership Now, I understand why he was upset about the mothership The mothership has insane shield regeneration, according to Vita Lorso, because the super battery was invisible I wonder if you watched the replay Saw it happen, I was like, ah, that's how it Or if he never actually watched the replay because he was too impressed by his opponent's playstyle What else? Unstoppable by my forces Maybe I lacked in upgrades, or maybe I just wasn't able to micro properly So, I mentioned the micro a little bit. is that you have the shift click, which I'm not even quite sure if I would really consider that massive micro, like you're not pulling back weak units, you're not even kiting It's just, this is like the most basic thing It's just target figuring stuff down It's not like it's bailings on creep or zirglings on creep Like these things are, they're kind of static, you know? It's like right-clicking static buildings It's like it shouldn't be too hard And you kind of did like that But the thing that I'm the most upset about is the constant landing of the Vikings without any purpose. Every single time after you killed a carrier, you felt the need to land four or six or eight Vikings, or even if you hadn't killed a carrier You would just idle outside of your opponent's base with eight landed Vikings And I honestly believe that even without Target Fire Micro, if just all of your Vikings during the entirety of the game stayed in the air, you probably would have won this So no, carriers and motherships aren't actually in balance It is you, my friend, who sucks And that's the cold truth All right Thanks everyone for watching Uncle Ronnie I'm looking forward to the next car riding your convertible And if you did like this video, don't forget to like, but subscribe to the channel. I'll see all of you next time for a new video Thank you And bye-bye."

        "text": "Plus, I thought Protos was the AMOV race I don't think you can actually start a sentence with a plus sign and then having a statement that makes no sense I think what happened here is that he accidentally removed the first part of the balanced complaint form Now, that doesn't show a great deal of intelligence, and it only took me five seconds to realize that So I have a feeling this is going to be a banger of an episode Let's continue I have more than 100 APM more than my opponent I have 400 more MMR, I bounced back harder Sure, I took some damage in return, but I gave as good as I got, with my fast forge plus one adapt attack. After the mess of the early game, he just sits on his bases and wait till he has ghost and Vikings to counter my army In a straight-up engaged protos just crumbles How could I play faster, be higher ranked, and play the A-move race, and still lose? while my complaints might be a bit exaggerated, there is no doubt that is how it views in the moment And my frustrations are real And yes, I watched the replay four times before sending it in to answer that ever-looming question All right A S Conviction A protos player from North America, who is in Masters with 4 6K MMR last season Let's hop into the game and answer the ever-looming question. Are Ghost and Vikings imbalanced or does he suck? Before we get into the build orders and all that good jazz, I just want to talk about what he actually sat there in his little form He said, hey, I have 400 more MMR than my opponent, so I deserve to win That doesn't really make a lot of sense Like results that are gotten in the past are no guarantee for the future Of course, often people with higher MMR have better skill as well But if I'm analyzing a current game either of myself or of someone else, else, I never for a second think about the MMR. I don't look at a Protos versus Zerk that I played and then think to myself, oh, I'm 600 MMR better I should have won that game No, I see, okay, my Oracle movement is poor That is why I lost the game, not, oh, I lost the game because of 500 less MMR It just makes absolutely no sense It's honestly kind of similar with APM Once again, if you're a very high-level player and you're very quick, you're very precise, that is generally a good thing if you really know what you're doing with that APM but if you're just smashing your keyboard to get as many button clicks as possible, there really is no point. I'm pretty sure we could train a gorilla or a chimpanzee to smash the keyboard at maybe 6 or 700 APM and I could give him one of my accounts that probably is 1,200 MMR higher than you are AS conviction That wouldn't necessarily mean that he is better It just means that he smashes the keyboard faster and that he managed to secure my account by maybe threatening me with some fresh poop that he was going to throw at me otherwise You never know I haven't communicated a whole lot with gorillas or chimpanzees in my life I'm not quite sure how well-mannered they are Anyway, let's take a look here of what's actually going on. So we see a double gas opener out of the Terran Now, that is interesting because double gas openers have become a lot more common in the Protos versus Terran matchup from the Terran side It allows Terran to put on early pressure being relatively safe get a quick mine drop There's a lot of variation behind this as well so they can get a reactor, a second Reaper, or maybe even get a Tech Lab and do some weird marauder play Maybe something Gumiho would do I don't think this is a wall This one's supposed to be over here This one is supposed to be further to the right Reaper's not going to try it out though It's just going to move in. You don't have a unit yet I'm not entirely sure why that is the case and you're rushing out a forge as well, which also is fairly odd Now, I always say don't knock it till you rock it, but I like to make an exception, and that is with builds that have a forge before a real tech structure This I can I want to see that again I mean, specifically, you always got a look at the first, whenever stuff like this happens, you always got to look at the first person of the person that messed up Because he thinks he's safe So he sees this maybe on the mini map, you know, he's looking at it He's like, I'm good Nothing to worry about. And here he still thinks he's good And now he sees it in the bottom, all of a sudden He's like, oh, the Reaper? How did that happen? It's fairly odd He's a Reaper in my natural as well This is an unfortunate situation what's going on over here It's like, ah, this Reaper How did that get in? Very unfortunate Then he's going to chase it away He's going to jump down again, obviously If the Terran pays a little bit of attention, it's going to be slightly upset It's funny It's a little bit like putting in contact lenses or taking out contact lenses, actually, with walls Sometimes, you know, you have the motion of the two fingers You squeeze. You think you have it, and there's like a moment of elation Then you look at your fingers, and it's empty, and it's still stuck in your eye It's the same with walls Sometimes you think you build a perfect wall, and then three reapers jump, in and kill seven workers Trust me, it's not a great moment This is a build order Like I was saying, don't knock it till you rocket unless it's a fast forge It's just one of the many rules that I have for myself These type of build orders, they sound very good in theory, fast upgrades or units deal more damage My adepts will be capable of two-shotting, but you simply have no cash for anything else. If you rush out a forge this fast, and it takes really long as well to get the plus one going This is also a god-awful defense The funny thing here is, is that the Reaper and the Hellions would have attacked the adept There would have been no units to defend, and they actually would have been capable of dealing more damage This is a little bit the empty fort strategy, which basically, if you don't know what this is, I think the story is that Zougal Yang, a Chinese army commander, he had to defend a fort, and he only had 2,500, men or so or 2,000 men defensively. And in front of the fort were like 100,000 soldiers of the opposing army or whatever, opposing tribe, I don't know what it was So what he did is he opened the gates and he grabbed like some special guitar, like some Chinese guitar And he started playing on some platform I think he also had two boys with him and he looked really relaxed and calm And the army commander on the other side saw that And I was like, hey, this guy is way too calm Surely it is a trap If we go in there right now, we're going to get absolutely destroyed Well, in reality, they just didn't have enough defenses, and it was a major bluff. The reason why this worked so well is because Zougal Young was known to be a fantastic army, a very competent commander that would never make such a huge strategical blunder The problem with AIS conviction is that so far, he hasn't really looked to be a very competent leader or army commander So despite it semi-working, it didn't completely work He still lost a lot of workers I mean, 10 workers against what was it? Three reapers, four reapers and two Halleons is a little bit much Now he's going to get Maybe he's going to go in No, it's not going to go, no Prism dice, cyclone dice as well This is a trait I honestly would be okay with if I was AS conviction. He doesn't know it, but he's still up four-ish workers He's up way in supply because he honestly hasn't lost that many units His opponent has There's triple C-C already Holy crap, what is this build? That's a really fast 3rd CC, honest to God It's rare to see that So, yeah, so far this forge has not really achieved much of anything Defensively, a forge is just so bad Like I said, it feels great to have very quick upgrades, and theoretically it often makes sense, but it's a huge investment that pays off so late in the game that against any type of early game shenan against, you're often just going to fall behind. And, yeah, being equal in workers, while your opponent has triple-CC and you're still building your third base just barely finished, that's usually not a very good thing Double e-base going down right now Benchy on the way as well with Cloke Let's not forget that our good friend AIS conviction is completely unaware of the fact that there is cloak right now, which could definitely be an issue As for Cloak, you need observers and you need to have units in position to deal with the Benchie as well, two stalkers One stalkers just dies Even with two stalkers kill a couple of workers This is nice though Like this feels really good You're two shotting SCVs, which is obviously great. But yeah, it's just not a very viable strategy Let's not talk too much about that See what's happening on the other side? Okay Cloke Benchie is just idling right now If that would be going in, that would be big trouble in my mind But plenty of damage has been done Prism is still alive as well, which means you can go in once more Now the Benchie comes in and I don't think there's anything quite ready, no observer Did our good friend spot it Did spot that something was researching here, but honestly, in the chaos of the moment, I can kind of understand that you don't see it. He was busy shading, it was busy microing, busy doing things that basically weren't checking the tech lab, whether it was green or not He's going to kill a couple of SCVs here anyway I still think this is a completely fine situation for the Protos player Protos is floating a lot of money, But once again, a lot was happening here I don't actually mind it so much if you float a lot if a lot of things are happening I mind it when you start floating money when nothing is happening And right now, not much is happening anymore So you need to send these workers back to mining You need to start building gateways I mean, you're floating 13, 14 other minerals. You have a crap ton of gas as well Start an upgrade OK, plus two One one's already done seven minutes and 30 seconds into the game, which is kind of cool Yeah, it's really need extra production at this point at this point there's no real excuse anymore There's no way that cannons are more important than increasing your production at this point It is super obvious to me Production should be the absolute priority right now And you also can't have the At first I gave you the excuse where I said, okay, it was chaos, you know, things went bad and, you know, you were a little bit stressed out I understand that you delayed your gateways. But at this point, you're pretty much like the friend who stopped his toe three months ago and says he can't help you move because it still hurts and, you know, he doesn't want to inflame the toe again or something or I don't know what toes do Don't want to hurt it again You know those people They always have an excuse ready You know, it hurts a bit here, a little bit of a headache Headache lasts for like five weeks as well No matter what date you suggest, they're never going to be capable of helping you move That type of friend That's you, AS conviction That is you Okay, charge on the way Gateway is being thrown down. What is this? Six, seven, eight gateways, nine gateways That's good More production Then you can maybe afford, but I'm okay with that as well at this point You're aware of your opponent moving out, despite your map vision being horrific, quite frankly Guardian Shield Super Battery can be activated No energy for the Super Battery, which means this could be a pretty difficult fight actually to take nice That was not very smart, was it? I want to see that again I'm sorry We're just going to have to re-watch it. It's going to be a difficult fight to take, but you need to make a decision at some point, right? You either need to decide the fight, the force field, or to stay away from the fight You can do 30% of this, 30% of this, 30% of this, and then the leftover 10% is you're just idling It's simply not possible You need to make a decision If you're fighting here, you're most likely just going to be fighting You throw down some force fields, you grab some units, you're fighting here But what you can do is half fight and then start running away without actually kiting. Because you're just going to be losing a lot of units for no reason, or just gaining a lot of damage, especially from the tank, for no reason I actually think you could have won this fight, given that you're up to upgrades and you still had a guardian shield to work with as well At this point, you have the super battery as well and the tank was shooting the entire way through So it feels like you still took all the damage and you dealt none of the damage during this It's not going to matter because you have plenty of units, so you're still going to be capable of defending. But this fight should have probably been fairly easy for you to win, and all of this should have died And now, well, that's not quite the case I also don't understand why you keep warping in stalkers, despite not having blink and charge lots being a way better solution to the problem that this army posed to you So A, it makes no sense with the upgrades that you build, and B, it makes no sense because charts or even just zealots would have just been better than stalkers in this situation Even if you would have had blink, it still would have been better to get zealots here But you didn't have blink and still don't have blink This is extremely risky and also needlessly risky. You still do not have blink, which means if your opponent stims, he's just going to catch literally every single stalker This army is just going to outrun you You're lucky that he didn't continue chasing or split off half of his army, you should have lost all five of these Why would you be on the map at this point? You just hell it? You know what your opponent Please tell me this vision was Okay, you had the vision before You see what is here This makes absolutely no sense This is like robbing the police station while the entire police force is there and you see it You see the police force sitting there And you try to rob the speaker in their meeting. It's like It makes absolutely no sense why you would do this You had full vision You know you have no blink If you have blink, this is a fine move because you can escape But you have no blink You're just going to get caught red-handed You lose five stalkers for nothing They're completely useless Completely useless Your follow-up tech is Templar Archives as well as a robot bay I much rather have you usually just focus on one of those initially, because it's rather expensive to get both at the same time The moment you warp in two arcons, you don't really have enough anymore to get your thermal lens and to get your colossi going And it's the same. If you get your thermal lens and a colossi going, you can't really warp in two arcons anymore So usually you make a decision, and once you get a higher gas count or your first few colossi are out, you can transition into arcons or the other way around Initially, you start with arcons, they transition into something I'm going to make you a suggestion here And I don't want you to think of this as an offensive suggestion But I think you should just not get blink anymore or stalkers Because you use them like you think pro gamers use them You know, you want to be active on the map You've seen it You've seen in like a pro match You see heroes. Like, oh, I've picked off like three Marines here That's great This is kind of like the do not try it at home when you were working watching Jackass as a kid, you know I'm just giving it to you Just don't try it at home Stick with the safe charge lots They kind of micro themselves Don't do any of the fancy stuff Just please It really hasn't gone well I think you've picked off three marines That's the thing that you copied from here Very well done Three marines And you've lost about 10 stalkers for that It's not a very efficient rate So you can just stop it There's no need, my friend Okay You've shown enough already. It's time to sit down and let the, you know, know, that the people who know what they're doing do that type of move Charcelal army, it's going to do absolutely fine It's a good A-moving army for you Can't go too much wrong Blink, yeah, that's fine as well, you know He's trying to catch up I'm all for it Half your army chasing two minds that aren't burrowed Doesn't really matter I like that you put the A-move army in the, what you call these? In air quotes? Except you did it on paper, so it's actual quote That's just called quotation marks, isn't it? Yeah Nice You put the A-Move army in quotation marks But actually all you do is A-Move. Like, you're not telling me that this Colossi and the two Zalads really wanted to go fight these two widow mines that were unburrowed I just, yeah I just have my doubts, personally I just have my doubts Ghosts are on the way It's also kind of sick that you had one-one at seven minutes, and now you're actually being surpassed upgrades Now this is a it's a marathon not a sprint So you got them very quick I would have loved to see a second forge at some point Honestly, I think it's a very good call for TOS to make a second forge You still have a good army though. You have an army that it like this game, this position in the game is better for the Toss than it is for the Taryn Taryn is on eight barracks, which is kind of big A second starboard on the way which is also kind of big Three three starting and ghost are out, which means that arcons aren't going to be super useful anymore, you probably need to start adding, well, second forge, second robotics facility, start thinking of things like a prism, disruptors, that type of stuff is really something that you want Okay, I I know what this is I know what this is I absolutely know what this is You've read somewhere Oh, hold that thought actually It's an interesting fight. This is not an interesting, it's a terrible fight This is an absolutely terrible fight Holy crap Now let me explain to you what this was, these five adepts You've read somewhere or you realize by yourself that if adepts have upgrades, that they can two-shot SUVs and this made you really happy And now you're just finding excuses to bring these adepts up in some way You know, you want to get these adepts in there You want them even if they're not good anymore at this point, you much rather have zealous running by They deal way more damage You don't have to look at them, which for you probably is quite good But you know that adepts, you know, they have this special property. You're like the friend that has like one fact about the Romans, and whenever something slightly related to the Romans comes up, he'll try to bring up this fact, you know? And you'd be like, ah, I went on holiday to Italy And then your friend goes, Italy, do you know that the Romans were there? And the Romans, you know, they had these aqueducts where they transported water with They were the first to do that And no matter what you do, he'll always find a way to bring up the aqueduct And it's the same with you, with these Adepts with plus one or plus two You don't even have Glaives on them. You build these adepts specifically because you know that it makes you kind of interesting You know, it's kind of like your thing, your gimmick It's a bad gimmick, though I've seen better gimmicks than that This is like the gimmick of peeing yourself and the clock hits nine It's like you might find it interesting and funny, but the people around you probably just find it annoying to go out with you So don't do it anymore It's over, my friend No more adept harassment This is also why you made that fast forge It's just for these adepts I bet you play this will every game as well It's pissing me off just thinking about it Especially when it works. You probably watch the replay feel so smug about it as well Yeah, they two-shot I hate Adepts You know, back in the day, Adepts without upgrades with two-shot SEVs and Marines That was insanely broken It's the first tournament and Legacy of the Void Fun fact Well, not a very fun fact if you were a Terran, but Sometimes Terran still wake up, you know, in the middle of the night, they're screaming Adapts! 2016! It's another great fight Then you know that they're thinking about the Adepts that two-shot everything that they had basically, at least in the early game A three adept pressure could kill a Terran back then Oh, the golden days Yeah, you really need to add some disruptors at this point. Your opponent completely has your army countered Huh I wonder if you use one control group and do it poorly with the disruptors, or if you use two different control groups and use both of them poorly I feel like it's one control group The way that that disruptor moved was very unnatural You really need a second robot at this point, by the way Disruptors are an absolute must against ghost Viking armies Like, you can't always keep the same army This is a very primitive type of army that does great against armies that don't have ghost and don't have Vikings If there's either ghost or Vikings, you need to transition out of this. If they only have Vikings, you can often make do with adding a couple of arcons But if they have ghost and Vikings, you need to get disruptors, or you're just going to get absolutely blasted, especially given that you're still down and upgrade as well So yeah, you're just going to get destroyed Like, this is just kind of how StarCraft 2 works I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing that there's such a thing as unit counters If there was no such thing as unit counters, you would literally never be capable of getting back into a game by tacking into something better or surviving to a superior tech If you were to win the early game then, you would also win the mid-game. because your army would just be better always It makes no sense Why have different types of units then? Everyone should just get pure marines That would not be very interesting or very fun Like playing chess, but only having pawns It would practically be Checkers, I guess Checkers is a pretty mediocre game I mean, I'm impressed that they managed to invent it so long ago, but it also shows that it's kind of crap Checkers feels like it could be an American source sport with how poorly designed it is, you know? Think of like baseball It's like, how did they come up with that? He's freaking American football It's really not that all that interesting, is it? Sorry, Americans I'm sorry, baseball fans. I know I go hard on you every now and again Yeah, I mean, this game is fairly over at this point, at least I think so You just lost one big engagement because you had an inferior army, despite being ahead the entire game, and plenty of time, plenty of resources to get a better army I always find it fairly difficult to say something too useful about this Your early game wasn't great, your midgame wasn't great There were lots of mistakes made, but despite all of your mistakes, you still were in an okay spot, and you were in an okay spot because you probably have a decent idea of what you need to do in general in the game You know, building units. You had a lot of workers all the time You expand it pretty quickly didn't fall behind in upgrades It's just you kind of missed the final step in your army Just disruptors That's truly the only thing You can also, you could have done it with actually a very big gateway colossi army, but then you would have needed the micro and sniped the Vikings and kite back And honestly, I'm not going to see it happening with the control that you've showcased so far this game It's mainly just been a moving, even with disruptors That's why you lost most of your disruptors as well How many is you built? Like two, three Okay Because you aim of them after you shot the purification of, yeah. Gigi gets put out giant orange wins You know, I'm just going to take another look at your imbalance complaint for him because you complained about ghost and Vikings, but these are actually just the straight up counters to the units, the tech buildings that you build at like the eight minute mark When I said, I would not recommend throwing down a robo-base and a Templar Archives at the same time That is the moment when you last kind of improved your tech It feels like you didn't go into Erictals, you didn't go into carriers, and you didn't go into disruptors And disruptors really is the first step It's a very basic step After two, after three Colossi, you automatically go into Disruptor of Double Robo. You just have to There is no way for ProDOS to win fights without that You need a second type of AEOE Arcons are going to get destroyed by EMP Vikings are absolutely going to destroy Colossi maybe you can do it if you build like eight, nine immortals, but disruptors are just better It's such a powerful unit and you really need it I don't think that the Terran late game army is imbalanced, my friend I think it is you instead Who sucks? That's just the truth I'm sorry All right So I'm here That's going to be it for me today Thanks everyone for watching I hope you did If you did, don't forget to hit the like button.

        "text": "Dear Harstam, this complaint is a little different because I don't know what was imbalanced about the Terran race All I can do is give you the facts I was up in income for majority of the game, had a good early game dealing a lot of eco damage and defending his two-base push, with minor losses that put me in a great spot for the mid-game I sent spotting units around the map giving me map control and my upgrades were even better than his I truly believe I was outplaying my opponent, even though he is a full, a thousand MMR above me I was playing the game of my life And yet, somehow lose, question mark. Please, Captain, tell me, did I outplay my opponent and still lose, or do I suck? Name, topspin, race, Protos, the Grand Master League 5 1K MMMR on North America And the question is relatively simple Did he outplay his opponent and still lose due to imbalance? Or does he suck? All right, and here we are in the game between top spin and ratio plus L And we see top spin with an early scout, ratio plus L also with an early scout, while playing a two gas opener Not a huge fan of this, personally And the reason for that is because the two gas opener already provides a lot of safety. Right? You can scout if you're doing a one-rex expand with a single gas as a term, but with two gas, it is extremely uncommon It's kind of like putting on a fourth helmet if you're going for a bike Maybe the first two or the first three helmets actually provide some added security to your head and to your skull, to your brain But the fourth helmet, it probably just makes it more likely that you're going to topple over because it's quite a tower on top of your head It makes it difficult to balance And that's why I don't really like it too much. You're already cutting so heavily in Eco here if you're the Terran player that by scouting, you're cutting even more into your eco for no real reason in my mind So yeah, I'm just not really a fan of it We'll have to wait and see exactly what the follow-up is going to be to truly judge it But yeah, I'm not a great supporter of this move But the Taryn is not who we're paying attention to We're paying attention to our Protos player who opens up with a stalker first and follows it up with a second stalker This means that the tech is going to be pretty darn delayed And usually you get one adapt at least. that way your tech is a little quicker, or you go for a no scout and mine more gas in the early game But here we see not a lot of gas being mined in the early game, and because the tech is actually going to be delayed by 25 seconds or so Usually you see a tech building going down at 218, 217, this time it was at 2 45 So, yeah, it's like 26, 27, 28 seconds or so That's a long delay on tech I think we also had a pretty long delay on this starboard, actually, for no real reason So our good friend Topspin is going to be lucky here Because that starport could have gone down about, what, 15 seconds faster. He's going to spot the timing on that star port Built a Twilight and a Robo here And I hate to do this, but I'm going to have to pass the replay here just for a millisecond Now, if you're playing against a two gas opener out of the Tarran, that means that the fastest possible factory is going to be out, which means that any type of aggression out of the turn is going to hit way quicker than it usually would As a Protos player, what you want in that case is gateway units in response to that You want safety You don't want to be losing any of your workers. If your opponent plays a two gas opener, most of the time there's going to be fast aggression If you play Twilight into Robo, you will not have a second gateway out by the time your warpgate finishes That means you're going to have less gateway unit that you need in order to defend anything Technically, at 345 or I think maybe even 342 on certain maps, you could be getting hit by a triple helion drop That would be a huge issue, which is why often we see three gateway units pre-warpgate and a second gate before the robotics facility. Now, this is a little technical, but basically what it means is that you're going to have two extra units over what topspin would currently have after the first warp in This is extremely unsafe despite there being a battery in the natural and a good position, this would die against a fast mind drop It would practically die against a fast Helion drop as well We're lucky that Ratio Plus L forgot his starboard for a little bit, but otherwise stop spin would be in a world of trouble If this was anything really aggressive, could even consider something like a proxy starport added in there as well. Like there's so many things here where this setup would have been terrible that it feels like a bad gamble A little bit similar as if you were to go to a casino, You sold your house and then with the money and all of the house and your life savings, you put everything in roulette on the number 33 Now roulette spins and it actually hits 33 That doesn't necessarily mean that selling your house and putting all your money on 33 was a good decision No, it's a decision that worked out for you despite it being an extremely risky decision. And if you were to do this move every single week, putting all your life savings on number 33 on the roulette, within a couple of weeks, probably within two weeks, you would be completely broke It's the same in StarCraft 2 If you were to play like this every single time you play against the 2 gas opener, you're probably going to lose way more MMR than you're going to win MMR This is not a consistent way to win against 2 gas openers A DT drop definitely isn't, because with a DT drop you want to cut even the third gateway unit The moment your warp gate finishes, you don't even want to warp in a stalker because it delays your initial 3DT warp in. This is legitimately the riskiest build that you can have in the entire world, and you're playing it against the most aggressive opener out of the Terran, which is, in my mind, pure insanity You absolutely hit the jackpot here when it came to build orders and build order execution, because your opponent dropped the ball a little bit on that So you're already naturally up 11 workers for no reason whatsoever, and your DTs are going to deal some damage because the raven comes out after the mine drop, and it does a little bit delayed So, at this point, the game is officially over If you were to give, ooh, hold that thought No, you pull your workers away, okay The game has now actually ended. There's more workers than you probably would have wanted to lose Also lose all of your DTs, I guess But it's 42 workers against 26 There is no stim out or stim on the way even yet Like, this game is so insanely over right now It's not even funny You're up practically 20 workers You have a third base going up already You have enough unit to defend anything that the Terran can throw at you in the next four minutes, practically Like, there's no risk of you dying at all You could probably double expand on top of getting your third. You could take five bases right now, deck into carriers, and you would still have enough units to hold your opponent's incoming three-recks push or, well, two-recks push, whatever it is going to be Like, the Terran is completely dead It's over, like over, over There's absolutely no chance at this point anymore No chance whatsoever The one thing that the Terran could do, which could be considered a good decision, is sending the Raven across the map or sending eight Marines in a Madovac to either try and catch your prison Oh, look Or to go across the map to try and harass This is an interesting move as well It's attacking the tank You have a bunch of soft targets here. in the Marines and you decide to let your only arc on that you have attack a tank with which is what, 175 HP, you managed to hit it twice and then you lost the arc on Not great decision making That's if you know that you have weak teeth that you then start biting rocks It just doesn't make a lot of sense Might want to go for something softer like beans or pineapples if they're very juicy Relatively easy to bite into as well I like this eight marine drop by the way I think it's a good call out of the Terran Terran right now is in a mode, what we call survival mode in StarCraft 2. You know you're infinitely better than your opponent, and you need to artificially find ways to create openings that will allow you back into the game But in reality, there are no openings here Like, like I said, the game is actually over Tosses up 20 supply, superior tech Thermal lens is going to finish before stim That is usually a pretty bad sign, especially if it wasn't even a Robo Bay or Robo into Robo Bay opener No, this was a DT drop opener into charge, into Robo Bay It's an insanely late Robo Bay, and Thermaland still is going to finish faster than Stim That is generally a bad deal here for the Terran It is a terrible deal for the Terran. I like this, just kind of idling here. This is kind of an insurance policy in a way. The Raven is here for arrest, but this is an insurance policy. The moment the Protoss decides to attack across the map right now, as a Terran, you can send this in, kill a bunch of workers and then hopefully defend with tanks. Like that probably is the plan. Get some zealot spread going on. That actually is quite nice. I like that. We'll provide you a bit of vision. Give you some response time as well. Here comes the Marine drop in towards the main base. At least you pull your workers away. But it's not the quickest response. There also were no units ready in the main. Piling gets taken out Some DTs get blasted as well Terran's actually playing this out quite well, honestly It really is Somewhat impressed even Attacking into this is probably not going to be it though It's too many marines in this army Super battery could get activated as well Yeah, this feels very good for it close Still, this game is actually completely over Raven here Metafax still stuck up here Yeah, this is just going to get destroyed The funny thing is that you kind of mention destroying your opponent in the midgame and outplaying your opponent. far, it feels like your opponent has actually been playing faster, you know, with these drops and with the raven harass and actually dealing some damage, like really squeezing water out of stone And the only reason why you're still so far ahead is just because you hit the jackpot in the early game This is basically as if you were in a fight to death with another person, you have a gun, body armor and a massive sword as well at the same time, and your opponent has like a wooden stick, like one of the twigs, like a small branch that fell down from a tree, still has the leaves on it as well. And every single time, like, you shoot him in the foot, like you're, you know, half of your shots they miss in the air or you're shooting your own leg And every single time you hit them, you go, man, I'm so much better than you I'm completely outplaying you Man, I'm so strong I can't believe how good I am at fighting It's like, well, this is just inherently an unfair fight and you're really far ahead already Like, you should be kind of ashamed that you took damage to eight Marines in a METAVAC, despite being up 20 supply against the Terran Usually you're down 20 supply against the Terran That's a 40 supply difference there And yet you're still taking damage here. Once again, the Raven comes in You could leave five stalkers on each side if you would want to, and you would still have no problem stopping this army You shouldn't have to leave five stalkers One or two stalkers should be enough Or you could kill this Raven? I didn't even know you could attack that I feel like you should be capable of attacking this as well At least use a feedback on it that would be possible These five marines have honestly done so much already It's insane Used to be eight marines back in the day though Fairly impressive So at this point we're at a stage in the game where you're taking a fort base. What is this? Huh? What is this spotter unit doing here? What is he? He's spotting like two meters extra than your cannon is What is this? It's the same How are you going to make any type of intelligent defensive rotations? That's not possible You get no information This is like installing an alarm system at your bed So when the burglar enters your bedroom, the alarm won't go off But when he touches your sheets, it will start ringing Like most normal people, they want an alarm system at the front door So when the burglar enters it goes off They would be over here You place zealots over here You place zealots in areas where. your opponent will move through if he wants to get to any of your bases On this map, these areas can be identified very easily It would be this general area It would be this general area and it would be this general area Because you're up in supply, you naturally should have map control And your opponent can't easily push those units away You should use that map control and put those units further forward What is this stalker going to do? If you want to spot early, at least put it over here That's the least you can do Might as not just put it here You're building pylons everywhere as well These units are completely useless practically for spotters. You brag about sending out spotters and your initial spotters were fine because you were still on three base, but at this point they need to move way further on the map, especially given the current situation The reality of the situation is that you're extremely far ahead You probably should even have your main army on the map right now and have vision with all your other units, which allows you free movement on the map Taryn is just going to be sitting back home, at least for a little bit I think that is the correct call Right now the only thing the Terran can do is sit at home behind tanks and then counterattack with drops. And if you're a Protos player or if you're just any player in general and you're ahead in a game, you always want to be thinking in the back of your head, hey, I am ahead currently How could I fall behind or how could I lose the game? What are my opponent's wind conditions? And then you want to minimize the chance of these things happening And one of the important things here would be to be capable of spotting any incoming drops, any incoming army movement while keeping pressure on your opponent to make it difficult to expand to a fort base That is important. So I like that you have a DT over here that really provides a lot of value, spotting the fourth base timing, allows you to know when to move out if you want to kill that fourth base You'd also want to know when they're moving out You're doing way less good of a job when it comes to that I could also just build an observer at this point, honestly You already have three colossi and three disruptor There's an observer with this army, which is not necessary anymore Usually you want to keep an observer with your army in case of mines, but because you have disruptors already, you have a way to clear mines without needing detection. You have the purification Nova, which is a great tool, by the way, for that Absolutely fantastic tool Viking here is spotting This terrain is playing exactly how he should, by the way If you're playing against someone that is worse than you, you want to drag it into a longer game so that the supplies even up, and then with your experience of taking better fights or perhaps some multitasking in a longer game, you can drag back the game and probably win it A bunch of Vikings are out here Supply Depot drop, fourth base on the way, some oversaturation as well You get a fifth base I would like to see more cannons being produced and more gateways as well. So the one way that you possibly could lose right now is by taking a really bad fight and then losing your bases subsequently and not being capable of reinforcing quick enough There's also no rush whatsoever for you and there would be even less rush if you had full vision of the map Because then you can very slowly just throw one purification Nova into your opponent at a time You know that base trades can't happen The moment your opponent base trades, you can actually pull the trigger and properly kill him, or you can go and defend against the army that's trying to base trade But taking very aggressive traits right now is the one thing you don't want to be doing. So I kind of like how passive it is that you're playing here, top spin Taking out a couple of Vikings as well, you still have three colossi alive Wouldn't have mined a second forge a bit faster? I mean, you're floating practically 4K as resources As I say that you warp in a bunch of units, so it's more like 2 5,000 resources DTs make their way towards the right side I mean, if you have a DT squad ready before the fourth base even lands, you know you're going to be in a good spot Scan 1DT gets taken out Where's all the DTs actually? You still have 3 DTs in the main as well It's kind of sick Not completely useful. This ghost are going to actually take a bit of a beating as well No DT blink either, which does pain me You're taking some okayish traits, I think, these were Any trade really is somewhat of an okay trade at this point You're outmining your opponent by so many Okay When I said any trade at this point probably is going to be an okay trade I meant a trade that falls within the realm of like one to one and a half one to two, maybe even, because you're almost doubly outmining your opponent What I didn't mean is lose 9 DTs to kill three SEVs That is not even really a trade That is just giving stuff away for free. And it's not a very good business model I would not recommend that, my friend You're going to go bankrupt sooner rather than later Do throw a couple of good purification of Has control on the disruptors is a little bit sloppy, honestly But I mean, you're hitting anyway You're still in a fine spot Despite these few mediocre traits, the purification novas made up for a lot of it You're down in resources lost, which is impressive because you have a lot of disruptors And disruptors tend to just trade slightly better, especially against armies that aren't very well upgraded If you're well upgraded yourself But I guess that DT loss really hurt you You still have three DTs They're idling in the main base. No blink on the dark frine whatsoever And you also have a bunch of random stall in the main base Not really necessary in my mind if you just have good map vision But then again, right now you're securing your bed sheets It's not, here you're not even securing any vision whatsoever So you're honestly kind of blind for how dominant your position is in this game, which is painful to see Sallet run by heading towards the right side as well The red side To be fair, it's also the red side, isn't it? Gateway What a huge fan of that. Obviously get spotted by the center tower here but if you're going to build it you might as well build it outside of vision range then like this is yeah who could have predicted that not me that's for sure who pick disruptor i kudu lord these are some engagements i was going to say this started quite well but This ended a freaking disaster I'm gonna, I need to watch this again I had the words, this looked quite well in my mouth You know, they were on the tip of my tongue I was gonna say them When this Disruptor shot hit, I was like, man, that's literally a 30 supply or so And I'm like, this game is practically over at this point. And then this link, look at this This is what, like 14 stalkers They kill one tank A Viking? Have an SCV And then all of a sudden there's only four left It's an interesting trade, once again, given that, okay, it's 2-2 against 3 plus 3 So it's not even that much It's actually better for the Terrans up one upgrade technically, if we count armor upgrades Which we do, by the way, we can't armor upgrade Still, an absolute win scenario for you Like you're so far ahead, it actually hurts me However, at the same time, you also have no map vision, which means that this type of move will not be spotted ahead of time not be spotted ahead of time. With your reaction time, that's actually quite bad because it means you're going to lose, well, 80% of your zealots that were over here Resources lost, once again, going to increase And usually numbers going up is a good thing Bank account, resource tab, income, all of that would be really nice for you to go up, but the resources lost, ideally you want to keep low I can't believe that this I need to see this again I'm sorry, we'll need to go back once more How is this possible? that you have six stalkers in your main base ready for this You see the move out or the load up I guess you don't see it, but your unit spotted it. He's like, yeah, where did the units go? Oh no! And then you don't even manage to target fire on any of the medevacs The one medevac that went down here was because of the auto target fire You could have targeted at least two Madovex down, Super Battery could have been activated immediately, DTs that were in the back could have been pulled You didn't even have to recall for this, honestly It wouldn't have been necessary Now, you actually lost some stuff, you lost your map control again, and losing map control against players, which are better than you, is usually very bad, because it allows them to make plays And this is the one thing that the Terran player is just looking for. He's looking to make plays Really, that's all he wants right now It's like, okay, if I can be fast, if I can take superior traits and eventually somehow secure a fifth base, there is a chance that I win And this is literally the only way that he can win Or if you decide to never upgrade your armor again and eventually fight 3-3 against 3-1, that's also a possibility, of course So again, another mediocre fight from your side over here Taryn once again is going to actually get some control of the map right now. And this is the first time in the game where I'm actually scared for you, not because you're behind, but because you were so far further ahead and didn't manage to win yet that I really have zero trust in your abilities to finish a game oh my god these disruptor shots are too good I don't understand how you can have this many good disruptor shots and still not win fights it is magical it actually makes no sense to me whatsoever okay give up some disruptors here lose the right side base actually starting to lose control of this game a little bit at this point actually starting to lose control a little bit Income, pretty equal right now. Once this fifth base actually gets flown over to the right side or to the left side, I think the Terran is in a playable position Now once again with the caveat that he's playing against you, because otherwise it would not be a playable position If this Terran were playing against someone else, that's slightly more competent He would be getting blasted from four different sides at the same time 42 stalkers, 6 disruptors, plenty of money to warp in 15D2 DZV wants to Great call Sending in the DTs Managing to lose six and killing I think maybe one XEV went down due to splash, but it could be incorrect there It's possible that six DTs killed nothing, which honestly is quite impressive. I think if you would aim or randomly on the map, they would get more than that They accidentally find a Marine And do manage to take out a Liberator there It only cost you five stalkers Ooh, look at his flank It's actually kind of a good flank And now you get caught Yeah, because you had no map vision of this side Your flank was practically open Your disruptor shots didn't hit You get absolutely blasted Yeah I actually can't believe that you were bragging about outplaying your opponent I don't think I've ever seen someone get outplayed this hard in a game This was an insanely impressive performance out of the Terran. If you would have sent me this replay with the title Throw of the Century, I would have been like accurate title or if you would have said the sickest comeback with solid map control, beautiful Terran play, I would be like, yeah, this was good Terran play This was a solid guide, basically, on how to come back into a game It was beautiful Perfect play out of the Terran when it comes to that And immediate, the moment he gets ahead, you see what he does? Straight up wins the game superior fighting, great decision making, also better upgrades somehow some way, despite being behind an eco from minute 3 till minute, well, 19 and a half or so. He only needed to get ahead once in this game, just for a little bit Just be even, it's all he needed, and he won the game there Fantastic stuff Outplay him If man hit the freaking jackpot, then try his best to throw the game for the next 20 minutes, then when he finally succeeds in throwing, complains about imbalance It's absolutely insane Gigi at least I'm happy to see that Because this Terran deserved a freaking Gigi Holy crap Ratio plus L Very well done Very nice game Top spin This complaint is a little different because I don't know what was imbalanced about the Terran race. The reason that you don't know what is imbalanced about the Terran race is because the issue here obviously wasn't with the Terran race Aaron These units are fine You managed to kill them many times over with disruptor shot You had a okay composition during large periods of the game Maybe you're lacking colossi a little bit at the end But overall, all of that was fine It's just your overall unit control, your complete lack of map control, your inability to control DTs whatsoever Like how many DTs did you lose this game? You lost 24 DTs, this entire game And the DTs that were the most successful were the first three that you warped into your opponent's main base. and they killed seven workers and then died That's not even successful for 3DTs, but those were the most successful DTs in the entire game That says something about your DT control If you don't understand how to control DTs, you don't actually have to use them You can also just build different You can build carriers They're very amovable It seems to be more in your lane Because the control in this game was actually atrocious Fantastic play out of Rachio Plus L, but Terran, my friend, is not Imba No top spin It is you who sucks And that's the truth All right That's going to be it for today's episode of is it imba or do I suck? If you believe that you've struck gold, and when I say struck gold, I mean, you played against something that's so extremely imbalanced that my eyes need to witness it Be sure to send it through the form down in the description below And I'll hope to see all of you next time for a new video Don't forget to hit the like button and subscribe to the channel and I'll see you next time Ciao Thank you."

        "video_id": "8FENKUQyABk",
        "text": "Dear Harstam, Marauders are my nightmare In most of my ZVT games, Marauders have countered so many of my pushes effectively and efficiently Both anti-armor bio-units, as well as having such thick Thor armor They can heal from MettaVex They have stim, and they also have concussive shells that rip my banlings, roaches and ravagers to an oblivion Even though I can win multiple engagements, my traits aren't effectively working I may be a little behind an upgrade, but my macro allows me to closely remax and win trades After switching to Muda's late game, I lose to a heavy biotransition of mass marine and tank Help me Name, Mooncakes, race, zirk, league diamond at 3 1K MMR on the North American server. And I guess the question here is, are marauders imbalanced? Or do I suck? And we're here to find out All right, Mooncakes, let's see what you've got First of all, very fast, what is this, a third overlord A little bit quick, I like it Quick on the supply, make sure you never get supply blocked Six links to start with as well So an aggressive approach at defending the Reaper Absolutely love to see it Continued gas mining after starting the gas and no third base So opening up with a two base opener here, most likely And that is viable I've seen that work in the past for Zurich players especially Zirk players that are a little bit lower level. Being aggressive in the early game can often really help at establishing a bit of a lead and from there on now just kind of winning the game I managed to push this Reaper away, which is nice Get the injects going as well So I could be wrong on this, but from what I recall is that if you open up with a two-base opener, is that your first injects should be injects So your first 225 energy on the queens should be inject and you should not get a creep tumor immediately Because you have a lot of money to spend because you're saving 300 minerals Because usually you get a faster hatchery here So a little bit surprising, a little bit confusing. Could still just be a lot of queens in the early game and then something else But right now Mooncakes is floating 440 minerals for no real apparent reason It is a little bit surprising A little bit confusing Oh, layer goes down Could be something like a Queen Lingnitis in my mind, at least, if we get another queen going And there's still some gas mining as well I don't really quite see what else this could be with such a fast layer Links go across the map for an attack Take out two Marines and almost manage to kill a mule as well Actually, we'll be capable of clearing the mule here. I think this was worth it, right? You clear a mule, maybe even get a second mule? Hop, two mules, Marines Good target fire as well here out of Mooncake That actually was fairly impressive I like that Now, behind this, something slightly less impressive happened, as we saw Moonke's floating 800 minerals Not really building anything Now it goes for a roach warren and a bailing nest at the same time, off of two base A rare build order that I haven't seen before And not the good type of rare build order You know, sometimes, I'm not quite sure if you guys and girls know Pokemon cards a little bit, But with Pokemon cards, you have these cards, like the very rare cards. And you'll get them like once in every 10,000 packets or something like that And they're very valuable This build order is also very rare, but it's more rare that if you had a Pokemon card in one of these packets that had an employee giving you the finger and the sites are completely burned and a dog bit on the side as well You open the packet and be like, hey, I've never seen this before, but I doubt it's going to be very valuable Well, I kind of have to intervene here as Harsham obviously has no clue about collectors or what they value Most of you probably already know that misprints can skyrocket prices to infinity in some and often quite random scenarios. So a half-burned trading card that gives you the finger would probably easily be enough for you and your whole family to retire Just check out this rare 1792 misprint penny that sold for a chill $2 5 million Well, that obviously has to have been some kind of money laundering scheme Who else would pay that much money for a single freaking penny? But in the world of cards, we also have this Sometimes cards get punched out crooked or shifted, and while that usually decreases the price, sometimes it just raises them for reasons Or look at this dark magician girl from Yu-Gi-O with, and I quote, A strain of hair where none should be. That is a pretty optimistic description for this small book, that was accidentally imprinted after a factory worker sneezed into the machine But let's get back to our unknowing and innocent captain It's the same with Mooncake's build order here It looks rare, unique and kind of exciting and it might make for a good story to your friends, but I don't think it's going to win you too many games The delayed hatchery for no reason into Roach Bainling, no evo chamber, no gases, but a lot of money. And, you know, in this type of situation, when I see a zirk floating 790 minerals, I think to myself, why not just build a macro hatch in this type of scenario, you know? If you can't spend your money, there's absolutely nothing wrong with just investing in a macro hatch Don't be ashamed or embarrassed doing something like this You might not have heard it before, but I think that is very important Just, you know, spending your money is more important than saving it in the bank There's no point for it to be in the bank Money needs to roll, you know, get the economy going Stuff like that All right Another thing that actually interests me here is that we have a layer. There's a lot of interesting things here Just from interesting thing into interesting thing We have a layer, but no scouting whatsoever We have a layer and the only thing it's being used for is for quick road speed This is odd to see because this Benji is going to deal damage, despite there being a layer finish at like the four minute mark And it's going to deal damage because there's no detection right now This is another one of these rare situations The overseer gets built and the Benchie already has five, six, seven kills It's probably going to get a couple more if it flies to the natural as well because there's nothing there. Mooncakes here is rather lucky that Patsy decided to not fly in towards the natural Surely he didn't build the overseer at home to go scout across the map right Surely this overseer was built in response to the Benchie Why would you fly it across the map after knowing there is a Benchie with cloak nearby? You don't have spores in your natural, there's no spore in your third base, there might be a second Benchie on the way that could be coming towards the bottom side What level is this decision making? Honest to God, this is insane The worst part is that it's actually gonna work out and spot this Benchy Now, I'm not worried that Mooncake's is actually paying attention to the mini map. And even though Patsy sends back this Benchy now to deal with this Ling run by, I still feel like Mooncakes hasn't quite realized it It's also coming home to deal with these roaches, I guess This game has been nothing short but insane so far, honestly Absolutely mental game Um, the only thing that That Mooncakes has done so far that is remotely close to being good is the creepspread It's like, in like an RPG game, uh, you're playing your Eldon Ring or whatever and all your skill points, you're just being put in one single thing It's the same here. And rather than picking decision making or, uh, macro or, uh, you're playing, uh, you know, you know, just general thoughts, like having a brain, intelligence, I guess that would be called in an RPG Instead, he put everything in creep because the creep thread honestly is pretty solid Like, I hate to admit it, but this looks pretty fine, especially for this level This is really good creeps rat, multiple tumors going at the same time, queens are at the forefront of the creep At the same time, though, I'm wondering, why are we getting an infestation pit and bailing speed, while having seven roaches and zero Evo chambers and being on 49 workers while mining six gases. I'm pretty sure that he took skill points away from intelligence in order to increase the creep spread You know how it starts with zero zero everywhere and then you have like 12 skill points to use He put 12 skill points in creep and then went minus five on intelligence to put five more in creep So he currently has 17 on creep, minus five in intelligence and still neutral on decision making and macro Honestly, the money spending has been okay ever since the start Like the first five, six minutes were terrible, but ever since then, he's been spending his money pretty okay Overlord speed, of course, definitely has the priority here over any type of carapace upgrades or range upgrades. You want to make sure that your overlords move across the map rapidly That way next time you send an overseer into your opponent's bunker, it flies over at very high speed and you might actually get the safety smart stuff A classic Reverger morph on the far right side of the map Barely outside of Tower Range, actually Oh, no, this is in Tower Range It's just showing off his units right now It's like a modeling show Look at them walk as all Reverger's could be models They canna, they kind of waddle their, their bumps as well with their How many legs do they have like eight? Nine? I think it's like eight legs, no? Six? Six maybe Six or eight eight legs. I can't really see it Like a spire-like creature Maddening All right So right now it's going to be one-one upgrades against zero-zero And we still have no evos as well Okay, first two evos now at the same time as the hive Oh, that is something that you don't really see too much No anti-art to deal with the bench eater, but there's loads of creep Could actually move the queens forward The funny thing is that this fight, if these tanks aren't seized, And if the Biles connect, which they do, could actually be okay-ish for Monk It wasn't great, but Actually, this was fine. Took out what? Like two tanks, a bunch of the marines as well? Could probably kill all of the workers here on the third base right now And it's probably the correct call to go for that as well, rather than attacking into this area where half of your revereters This is the priorities of a man with minus 5 intelligence Goes up, gets hit by the tank It's like, ooh, that's a lot of damage Let me move back But before I go home, let me attack this refinery and a little bit of damage on this command center as well before I leave Brilliant stuff I love it Gets hit another time by the tank because of that And Benji cleans this up. This army wasn't even that marauder heavy There's like four marauders in here I have a feeling Now, I don't want to speak too fast, like ahead of my turn But I have a feeling here And that feeling is that it might not be the marauder that is giving you trouble, but it might be the fact that you don't have any upgrades, and your opponent is already getting too, too Just a misdiagnosis from your end And that is completely okay It happens to the best, you know? No way No way No way Who hasn't gone to the doctor and said, Doc, I have a little bit of pain in my shin, and I'm not quite sure where it's coming from. And the doctor looks down and says, well, sir, it might have something to do with the fact that a crocodile is biting your leg currently If you then tell your doctor, no, it's just my shin, you're an idiot So I'll give you the opportunity here, you know, to in the future redeem yourself I'm telling you right now, it is the upgrades and probably not the marauders, but then again, I've only been playing this game for 12 years of my life I could be incorrect It could be that the marauder is your real problem here, and in that case, I apologize Maybe I spoke too soon. Maybe this game is going to show me exactly that the marauder is the real issue in this game Viable It is possible It's a viable theory But we'll have to wait Adrenal glance, before the Malay upgrades or before any upgrades Now, technically, this is a good choice because adrenel glands gives a 40% increase on damage output of links So if you're building links, which you're not, this would be a correct call Your army consists of roaches and baylinks and legitimately zero links So you're getting an upgrade, a damage upgrade, your first damage upgrade in the game for a unit that you do not have Now, this is impressive to, a different degree I don't even quite know how to put this into words. And despite all of these failures, you're still winning fights Despite being down in upgrades, despite all your wrong choices, you're taking fights in the middle of the map that go your way If I was the Terran here, I would be fuming, constantly clicking these roaches and ravagers, seeing that it's still zero-zero-zero upgrades I'd not only be extremely confused, I'd also be upset If this Terran would scan you, by the way, he'd be even more upset, seeing like an infestation pit, a hydrodden and a hive before a single upgrade Now, we're going into a situation now where there is two two upgrades for the Terra and zero zero upgrades still for the Zerk. Now, winning ZVT without upgrades is a little bit like doing the cinnamon challenge while having asthma It is technically possible, but there is a decent chance that you'll end up dying or at least hurting yourself a lot And that's kind of what's happening here as well Like, the upgrades are such an important part of the game It is really vital Like, it's one of the main things in StarCraft too, really Like, you have your general macro, like building units is very important Building workers is very important And then just below that, you're going to get the upgrades It's like in your top three priority list, basically, with like workers and building units It's right underneath. It's like forgetting the car while having a Formula One race or not bringing your bike to the Tour de France or forgetting your brain while going for an American driving exam Although in that case, it might actually still work out I've been into America a couple of times and I've seen the way that you guys drive It's not pretty It's really not that pretty But yeah, it's important most of the time to have upgrades in your army There are some cases in which it's not about it. Here, this type of fight, I still think you probably wouldn't have been capable of winning it if you had 2-2 upgrades on this, but without any upgrades whatsoever, it's most likely just going to be completely impossible Fighting outside of tank range, 2-2 versus 2-2, you might have actually been capable of fighting this army Ultralisk Cavern at the same time as your 1-1 starts And this is just so beautiful to me You start range upgrades the moment you start transitioning out of roaches Like you start the range upgrades and you morph 41 Banelings immediately What a decision The only upgrade you have right now is for the Lings, which you have seven of Tunneling claw starts, despite you only having what? Ten Roaches left. I guess you're building four more spire ultra camera Are we going to alt tech on 80 drones here? This is beautiful You love to see it Is there even Burrow? Yeah, Burrough is here already Haven't seen it used yet, but it definitely is here This type of stuff is so hard to deal with, by the way, if you're down four upgrades Like drops are a freaking nightmare, honestly Look at this Actually, this is the entire army, so it might be capable of actually training with this army, especially if Biles also end up hitting, which they don't, but still If the Taron attacks you right now in, honestly, the next 30 seconds, I think you're straight up dead. he could A-move with this army, once again, nothing to do with the marauders, more to do with the fact that you're down four upgrades, and that your army consists of a Reverger, Roach-34 banlings, against 11 tanks and 19 marauders and 21 Marines This is attacking into a siege-up position The moment siege tanks have better upgrades than your Roach army, usually you know you're going to be in a bad position This was an absolute massacre And also, once again, Even if in this case you would have had similar upgrades, the reason why you would have lost this fight wouldn't be the marauders, it would be the tanks You're attacking into a siege-up tank army with mainly roach ravagers and balings that aren't being split. Like, yeah, of course you're going to lose that fight It was freaking eight tanks firing simultaneously, pre-seaged up already, no split out of you whatsoever, no good flank, just one big row of attack Like, yeah, it's not going to work They're going to have to deal with Ropshire You're lucky, by the way, your opponent didn't continue upgrading because 3-3 should have been finished at this point You would have been down six upgrades The only thing that could have made this worse is if somehow your opponent would have gotten a sentry in his army and used for guardian shields, so two extra armor upgrades and used an anti-armor missile on your units. Then he would have been up, what is it, at five, would have been up 11 upgrades technically That would have been so I've never seen that before in my life, mainly because Taryn can't use guardian shield, they don't have sentries, but otherwise that would be pretty sick and I would love to see that Like 11 upgrades up I'm pretty sure at that point the Marine can take out an ultra as well Love the Ultra Cavern, by the way, seeing lots of use from it Big building over here I guess building ultras into marauders that have six upgrades more than you would not be brilliant This is also one hell of a fight Zero zero mutas into two marines with six Madovacs above it. Single control group, all of this as well No bailings being used, despite the counter to the Mura's being Marines, and the counter to Marines being banings Now, another cool thing here is that the Mura is not a fighting unit, but it's a harassment unit It's not supposed to be in an army and deal damage It's supposed to kill workers, destroy turrets, maybe pick off a tank, maybe pick off a mine here or there It's not supposed to be used as a straight up fighting unit against an army It really is a very specialized role. If you're going to build Muralis, if you're going to invest a lot in Muralis, you need to use them how they're intended as well by kind of flying around and trying to deal damage with them You can also use them to control the pace of the game and kill drops This actually is a pretty okay fight And you take out this pace One of the main reasons why this was an okay fight was because you only fought against a static structure and there was no army there to defend it That definitely did help your case. your opponent now decides to move out and probably is just kind of going to poop on your army honestly you have zero upgrades on your muda list you do have adrenal glands and you have six links out so I'm kind of curious to see what these bad boys are going to be doing sadly without oh they have one carrot base upgrade I don't think the links even got to attack once it's a good move command here as well kind of want to see that again but maybe we can do it in slow motion I wouldn't mind seeing that one in slow motion here we go A move Lost 40 supply before the fight starts Beautiful stuff Lots to see it. I don't even think a single Marine went down here He maxed out during the fight Then you know you've had a good fight If you start a fight with 196 supply and you end it with 200 Life's got to be great Life actually has to be great in that case Freaking Potsie playing a pretty decent game Nice early game as well I mean, I'm not even quite sure if I have to take this type of imbalance complaint for him serious It's obvious to me that Marauders had absolutely nothing to do with this win here for the Terran. The reason that the Terran won was A, because he had better unit composition, B, because he actually made upgrades, not because he built more upgrades, but because he had upgrades altogether You build no real attack upgrades until like 16 minutes into the game or Carapace upgrades It's actually insane Like, this is nothing, like, it could have been anything It could have been, it could have been Marines Like, you probably would have lost a mess hallion at this point Like, if halions or halbats have their blue flame and they have their plus three attack and plus three armor, I'm pretty sure they're going to be capable of beating Masroach as well. Like, your composition was bad, but also the fact that you had no upgrade makes it absolutely unplayable There's nothing to do with the marauder This has nothing to do with imbalance This has everything to do with you suck it And that's just how it is All right, that's going to be it for me today Thanks all so much for watching I hope you did enjoy it If you did, don't forget, hit the like button Subscribe to the channel And hopefully I'll see all of you next time for a new video If you did enjoy it, don't, yeah, hit the like and all that And submit one in the form below if you believe that you have encountered imbalance on the latter.

        "text": "Good day, Mr Harsham I'd like to submit a complaint about Terran Their comeback potential is just too high First, they have buildings that can fly, so it's just impossible to truly kill a base Second, and that's what is imbalanced, is they can stack their macro mechanic to gain benefit from it immediately For instance, if a Zerk messed up their inject, they cannot inject five times at once and get 20 larvae If Protos was not chrono-boosting for five minutes, they cannot chrono-boosting for five minutes They cannot coroner a boost five times to reduce ProBuild time to three seconds But if a Terran does not macro properly, they can drop 5 mules simultaneously and get 1,300 resources at once. How is that fair? Please watch the attached replay Thanks for that note I was planning on just reading your complaint form and giving you the finger But now I'll watch the replay The Terra was completely dead for the first half of the game Then we had semi-based rate, during which my potato computer lacked for several times seconds and all my mutas flyed into mines and died This is the oldest excuse in the world, lack, which resulted in a situation where I had two times more drones and the same amount of bases But you know what? Mules He just dropped like five of them and get back into the game So please tell me Mr. Harsden, is stacking mules imbalanced or do I not understand something about that game and thus suck? Question mark Name Darkson, Rays, Zerk The league is Diamond on North America with 3,600 MMR The question is simple Is stacking mules imbalanced or does Darkson suck? All right, here we are in the game then Between Marie, our Red Tarrant player and Darkson, the man, the mid, the legend, and the one will be paying attention to opening up with a pool first here I don't completely mind that I often say at lower levels, one of the greatest things you can do is open up with, not a cheesy opener, not an all-in, but an early pressure, as I like to call it. You know, get your four links, get your six links across the map, followed up with some roaches for all I care Like your standard link into roach build is just going to get you quite far ahead in most games Now, of course, it has the downside of always being up in a macro game if you do end up transitioning into a macro game afterwards, which makes you believe that you should always be up that much in a macro game, which tends to not exactly be the case Anyway, we have Marie here who opens up with a, Yeah, what is this? CC into Marine, no gas for a Reaper No gas for a quick factory either. So it must have been a slightly delayed gas or if we got to send us SUVs into gas Confusing opener, to say the least, here coming out of Marais He's going to struggle a little bit as well against these initial six links because there was no scout here whatsoever He only has a single Marine He's not building anything else with this barracks, despite I imagine they're first going to be a factory Yeah, so definitely could have had two extra marines here, most likely at least Most likely could have had two extra marines here Instead built nothing, and I was going to struggle against this initial move out here with these six links I would like the control on that. Also like the split off here on these links Forward to the main, two in natural Should have targeted down the SEV a little bit faster It's been quite slow with that Before it's a big SUV pool This is probably already worth it, honestly Taking out an SUV here Probably we'll get a second one Might even get this Marine as well Yep, there we go The second Marine is now out This is all completely fine Behind this, though, there's no macro whatsoever We saw a mineral float of 700 coming out of our Zirk player And you could say, well, Harsdom The Terran also was floating a bunch of money That's true. but he couldn't really spend the money because A, he couldn't start his orbital yet, that's 150 minerals, and B, because he had to build more Marines, he cannot produce two Helions at the same time So, yes, he floated money, but it's a little bit unfair to compare these situations, because the Zerk floated money because of incompetence when it came to multitasking, and the Terran also floated money due to incompetence, but a different type of incompetence, not due to the multitasking, but because his build order wasn't completely perfect that is different At least in my mind, that is slightly different One player doesn't have a builder, the other one just doesn't have the speed. But yeah, in the end, both of them flowed a bit on money I guess that is a fine comparison Follow-up here is a two gas roach This is starting to smell a little bit like an eight to nine roach push, and you kind of have two paths that you can walk here, I would say So you have the path of the nine roach into drones, and then you have the nine roach, the 8th roach as we're seeing here into into a lot of links as a follow-up And especially at a link follow-up, we've seen a lot recently in professional play. We've seen several play this a couple of times and when several plays and all in, you know it's going to get copied a lot So here we have Darkson And the next injects basically decide what's going to happen What will happen with these larva? That is an interesting question It seems like Darkson doesn't quite have an answer to that question yet either as he's saving up Okay, it's going to be links Now, When you open up like this, a roach into link push, your goal is to attack as fast as possible, basically You want to kill your opponent If not kill, at least, extremely limit them for the future. Take out depots in the main base, take out as many workers as you can, basically kill them, but keep them alive Like, this is an all-in I really would call this an all-in This is not a pressure anymore So it's important that you also treat this as an all-in He's taking, it's not taking too much time, he's going for the depots I wouldn't mind completely ignoring those and just straight up running for the ramp here Yeah, yeah, this is what I'm kind of, this is what I was kind of afraid of and this is what's happening here exactly I'm going for the depots first, then even going down here for this Okay, this is completely wrong. Now, I'm going to explain this in that the goals are incorrect The execution by itself isn't necessarily incorrect if you were doing something else It's just a mismatch between the strategy you're picking and the execution of the strategy Okay Now, imagine we have as a goal that we want to buy a house and our coworkers ask us out for lunch So, co-workers actually out for lunch, you go, no, sorry, I'm saving money because I'm planning on buying a house It's a fair excuse, co-workers, whatever, sounds good then the next day you show up to work in a completely new car Your co-workers are like, hey, what the hell is that? That makes no sense whatsoever I thought you were saving for a house. And buying a car by itself is not necessarily a bad thing The problem is just that you had the intention of buying a house And when you buy a car, it's a lot of money that you're wasting there It's the exact same here with this road raverger ling bust Basically, your goal here is to kill your opponent But you're treating this as if a limited thing pressure killing workers is going to be enough If you wanted to just kill workers, kill a couple of depots, and then piss off into a macro game, you could have gone without all of these links You built 30 links, that is 15 drones 15 drones. You could have had extra right now, and you would have had the exact same result I guarantee you with just the initial three roaches and five ravagers as you would have had now These SUVs you're only getting, because your opponent ran down to this area rather than pulling up into the main base as well So you're wasting a lot of time for no real reason You would have gotten these SCVs as well with just the roaches That's a mistake out of your opponent, but he would have made that mistake in both scenarios most likely So basically what you've done here right now is you haven't killed your opponent, which is the goal with this build. And you're not even going to be far ahead economically because you build all of those links So basically, you know, as a kid, sometimes you have to match the world with like the picture, you just saw the word boat and you matched it with the picture of a car And it is incorrect It's just completely incorrect By themselves, like both a boat and a car are completely fine to do But you do need to mix it with the correct strategy and the execution need to be mixed properly Now, what is completely incorrect here are these roaches If you want to reinforce a push that is happening already at this moment, You're not going to be building roaches. Why not? Because Roaches are freaking slow They take a very long time to get across the map And by the time they arrive, the push most likely is already going to be over This would be like saying that you're going to buy a house and then you're going to your local Louis Vuitton store and buying an entire outfit of Louis Vuitton There's not a single point to that Nowhere in the world has anyone benefited from buying a Louis Vuitton outfit The only one benefiting there is Mr Vuitton And does he really need more cash? No, he doesn't So stop buying Louis Vuitton outfits and stop building Roaches to reinforce a Roach Ravager Ling push. See, your push is getting pushed back right now, which makes sense Or you would have killed your opponent already But these roaches are going to arrive after the fact And they always would have arrived after that Look at this Brilliant Everyone died You can maybe lick up their blood or something like that Brilliant stuff They're actually in a bit of trouble right now, despite the start of this push going extremely well This really was my issue with it This really is my issue with it Basically, you should have been at like 55 workers at this point If you would have been at 55 workers, maybe even more, look, you keep building this. You could have been at 55 workers with these 20 links already out as well And then at home you could have had queens So you still would have been capable of defending the counterattack, and you would have been up so far that it, even if your opponent had freaking three orbital commands with 12 mules saved up, it wouldn't have mattered at this point At this point, it wouldn't have had You would have been so far ahead But instead of that, you didn't kill your opponent's army You didn't kill enough Eco I still believe you're kind of Yeah, I still believe actually you're ahead, but you could have been so far ahead that the game would have been literally unloosable. At this point, well, the game still is literally unloosable, but it would have been literally, literally unloosable We already have the insider information that you do end up losing this game And it shows me that despite your good early games and your understanding of early game kind of strategies and tactics, you probably have poorer macro skills I'm kind of seeing that 600 minerals floating Okay, nine drones at the same time I would not mind seeing a couple of queens being added right now for creep spread, but also for general, you know, adding into the defense, both transfuses and general tanking power Queens are absolutely fantastic There's a reason why it's the unit that every single pro-Zerk in the world builds a crept on. Zirks disagree with each other all the time The Koreans with the Europeans, the Europeans with the American Well, most Zirks or most people in general disagree with the Americans when it comes to StarCraft 2 theory But they all agree on one thing, and that is that the queen is a very good unit in most, most games 99% of the games you want to get more than three queens if you have three hatcheries I actually believe that if the Terran knew how to micro here that you would die Which is insane after how this early game went I'm going to spoil that You scouted, not with this overlord, I think, but just with your, your, you're a spire. all in that there was five wrecks and no third base okay you know that you're up in upgrades you know that you're up in eco you know that you're being all in the mutalisk is a unit that has a special to specialty i would call it it's good at harassing and it is good at defending small drops your opponent is two base all in you you're not going to be harassing your opponent with what 10 mutas, it's going to be fairly easy for your opponent to defend because he only has two bases One of the reasons why mutas are so nice to have is because the defense needs to happen at multiple places despite, so let me explain this properly. Imagine there's 10 muras and you're playing against a one base terran In order for the terran to be safe, to have his economy safe, he'll need to build one turret Now if there's 10 mudalisks and there's six bases, the terran will need to build six turrets at every single base, one turret That means that the same investment from the Zirk gets a way bigger response out of the Taryn Also, Taryn will probably need to keep units in different positions If you have six bases, if you have two bases, you put like maybe a Madovac here, or you put five or six Marines here with half a Madovac You're going to be just fine. You can protect all your infrastructure, all your SUVs are safe So this is why often against two base all in, you don't want them Another reason why you don't want them is because with two basal ins, your defense tends to be quite tight Muralis is one of the most expensive Zerk units that has no fighting power whatsoever They're garbage in a straight-up engagement They're great at what Mura's do Mura's a fantastic unit Don't get me wrong People lose to Mura's all the time But the problem is that in a direct fight, they're just not as brilliant So they're not good in a direct fight They're mainly for harassment And your opponent shouldn't be doing drops. Your opponent is doing drops, but that's a mistake Just because your opponent is making a mistake with how he decides to use as units doesn't mean that the spire here is a good decision Even if you're going to get all the use out of it in this game, that doesn't mean that the spire was a good decision Staying on pure Lingbane, adding more hatcheries to make sure that you can spend your money Or even going Lingbane Hydra, I wouldn't have mined as much You're getting a couple of raveragers in there because you already have the Roche Warren after all I wouldn't even have mine as much But defending a two bas-al-in with mutas, you'll hear every single Zerk say this as well. They'll say two things One is that queens are freaking brilliant against everything And two, that mutilists suck against two bas-alins These are just, these are actual objective facts at this point Just because your opponent is dropping, which is a mistake, doesn't make your response any better Your response is still as bad Your opponent just also has a bad response to your response I do like this drop, actually I can't do like this girl Also floating 1,100 minerals Still too little queens as well, only two Really should start adding some queens Also a great way, by the way, to spend money Queens do not require larva to be built There we go 20 seconds. This is like, you know, in Hollywood, the Wild West movies, you have the jewel at like noon or something like that So they meet in like the main street, waiting until the bell chimes 12 You're just standing there Can't draw their gun before This was a similar situation, except no one heard the bell, and currently it's 3 p m They were just standing there, one matter of back flying in air, just chilling, or the other guy has just idling right next to it I think that legit took like 25 seconds or so He's awesome It's a wonderful waste rate What was I going to say? I was talking about queens Yeah, queens don't cause larva. So they're not really impeding your ability to produce other units They're great when you need to spend money and you want to defend something I don't mind this run-by completely But there's one thing that is wrong here And I'm actually going to go back into the game a little bit for that Okay? So these run-bys with Lingbeen Murat are quite common against things like if you're playing against an a-drax out of a terran In that case, Terran usually has a third base You'll see like a massive run-by with muta link The mutas make it easy to break basically anything And the links, you know, they also clear absolutely everything So together they work well. However, whenever you see this, Zerks always leave a bunch of bainlings at home And the reason for this is, is when you have bainlings on creep, no matter the amount of bainlings, as long as you have like 10 or 12 bainlings, it is difficult for Taryn to move forward quickly in the base rate This allows the Zerk to quickly take out the opponent's base, or at least the active mining bases, and then return back home with this while the banlings are stalling If you don't have any banlings for stalling, then this base race isn't actually that good Like, it's nice that you kill a base Don't get me wrong You're still up three bases even after losing your fort. Well, you're still up two bases, even after losing your fort Good Lord, elementary school math is difficult But the problem is that your opponent can actually get a decent position This is also a brilliant start of a fight, I have to admit Is this the lag? This has to be the lag moment Now, I had my doubts when I read it in the imbalance complaint form that this was actual lag But, you know, let's just take a look at this at first person take a look at the APM that's happening during this I'm going to slow down the game a little bit as well So we see moving off the camera, APM at 300, 400. It's hard to say if he lacked or if he just didn't micro his units I mean, he was moving the camera, which I think if you're lagging, I'm not sure if that's even possible I want to see this again I don't want to play a judge here, but I think there was some camera movement during this, no? If you lack, I don't think you can move your camera Was there camera? No camera movement here Now he starts moving again 50-50 It might have been lag actually It might have actually been lag I don't want to say no, because it might have been true Now, at this point, the game feels fairly over in favor of our Tarram player, I would say. It's 27 workers against 12 He started the hive? When did he start the hive? Oh my God, I can't believe we're going to see this fight for a third time I want to see the decision making behind this Oh my God, I think I missed this the first two times So what does he scout? He's supply blocked He's like, ah, I just lost my fort base My opponent has no natural left The thing that I really need is adrenal glance in three and a half minutes from now What is this? Maybe he just saw that the queen just popped I was like, ah, let me use this axiory For something at least This was the worst fight I've seen in my life. It might actually have been lag Even if it wasn't lag though, the decision to fight there still was a bad one You should have kind of weighted it out, gotten way more banlings Should not have gotten a lie Why is the muta being produced right now? A muta can't even beat a single Marine Think if you fight a Marine against the Muda Lisk and the Marine is being healed, the Marine actually gains HP Like the Muta has negative damage output It's actually, it was initially designed as a support unit where the muta bounce would just heal your own units This is one of my many theories I have Like the mutilist, mutilus DPS is pathetic I can't believe this defense works out. Is it there and forgot the micro there Holy crap, this is an insane game I actually can't believe we went for a hive 27 workers workers Down 50 supply or something, an army supply The response was to get a hive rather than getting five extra bailings Love to see it Anyway, is this still a playable position right now? Is a question that you could ask? I think the answer might be yes Yeah, I might be playable You have 32 workers You're mining off of a base and a half Your opponent is mining just off of one I guess with the orbital flying over, it could be pretty rough I'm not understanding of this layer whatsoever Like, is plus two carapace important? Yes. Is it important enough to invest the money to get a layer right now when it's obvious that you you're going to need it in the moment Your opponent's never going to get 2-2 anyway So despite upgrades being important, I don't think it's the most important He got Carapace Flyer first as well He's really keen on the upgrades Last week we had the guy without the upgrades This week we had a guy who's really keen on the upgrades Not sure what I prefer I feel like in this situation, surely getting no upgrades would be a lot better So it takes the natural Usually I'd say take a different base that has more mineral patches maybe, but I don't know. I'm not going to be too critical of that This army goes across the map Eight muras You much rather would have just more banlings at this point, right? It's just simply better Especially if you're not going to be using them for any type of harassment, which quite frankly could have been used There's no turrets whatsoever Beinings Was that also lag? Oh my god Look at these banlings I feel like the banlings were being A-moved and the banlings had the right idea here Look at this Look at this fight Just look at this fight They're going, they're aiming for the marines and then they dodge the marines To go straight into the unit that can tank them I don't even understand. This is like just driving into a wall for fun Why would you do that? Yeah, your car is totaled Congratulations At least the wall is also damaged It's like, yeah Two marauders went down He lost like all of your banlings And then he tried to fight with the eight mutas into the marines Like, huh 200 resources against the 50 mineral unit Still not quite the trade that I thought it was I mean the mules did decent here, guys I guess we saw the five mules fall earlier I guess those are the five mules that you were talking about. Is an odd thing to complain about in this game though, isn't it? I would, if I were a zirk and I wanted something to complain, I would talk about the tanking damage of the marauder or the inability of a 200 research unit called the Muda list to kill a single marine which is only 50 minerals Like I'd have a lot of things to complain about, but I don't think I'd doubt touching the mutas. It's not like income was the issue here, was it? This is, this is, the funny thing is, is that the resource loss-wise, this wouldn't even be super uncommon to see, right? You see, okay, maybe 10k at this point is kind of uncommon, but seeing a Terran very far ahead isn't that uncommon The funny thing is, is that the Terran has been playing like, the Terrible like five minds this entire game, legit five No, there's There's still six alive So he built 11, but he probably lost five mines He had a terrible army the entire time Any amount of banlings would have killed him because the terran control wasn't that great That's often the case in Diamond It's not to judge Mr E. It's not Marie It's Mr E Not to judge Mr E It's just like this is one of the things The baling is just a better unit at lower levels because the micro against the baling is harder than microing with the baling All you need to do is try and not aim at the marauders and as a terran you actually need to split, move your marines back, all of that good jazz Holy crap, these are some bad fights It's actually quite impressive And one of the main reasons probably because you lost so many muras, right? Yeah Bill 22 Muda Lysk playing against a 17-minute 2 base alone And this game is absolutely over why we're still watching this This is some heavy copium. Darkson couldn't win the game Up 45 workers, up two bases, up and upgrade as well and then believes that he could still hold 26 a plane against 99 I mean, this is the type of game where I just don't quite understand why they pick what they pick to complain on The comeback potential is just too high Well, this is something you can say if Terran actually has to make a comeback You can have handed him the comeback, A, by building the mutalisk against the two base all in, and B, by taking some of the absolute worst fights that I've seen in my life You even already say, like, my potato computer lacked, all my mutas flyed into mines and died. Well, not just your mutas, also your lings and your banes and the rest of your army But do you think it's fair that if someone doesn't micro their army for five or six seconds that they would lose the fight and that the opponent is capable of making a comeback? I think that is fair I mean, the game shouldn't be balanced about, like, around your crappy computer It's like, oh, majority of Zerg players have worse computers than Protoss Well, in that case, we make Zerg easier to micro in case they lack How does it make any sense? Like, it's nice to have an excuse for why you lost your entire army for free for yourself Maybe it helps you sleep better at night. That is completely okay But I think it is completely normal that if you don't control your army for that long, that yeah, you're going to lose absolutely everything, despite that if you would have microed a little bit there, would have had 10 more bailings, probably would have absolutely destroyed that fight I don't even think the mules had much of an impact The moment the mules actually got into play, I think you had already lost the game Even without mules, I'm pretty sure that the Terran still would have won Like the final fight was 96 supply against 25 I don't think that would have been vastly different if he would have had five less mules there. He might have had, what, like 20, 30 less supply or so Still would have died because all you had were like four muras and half a bainling Mules were not the issue, my friend Your terrible control, your lack of decision making, your Bad execution with the early game push, which already should have either won you the game, but you're so far ahead that it would have been unloosable These were all the issue Mules stackable, what you call it? Stacking Mules is not imbalanced You, my friend, just freaking suck That's how it is All right That's going to be it for me today I hope you did enjoy this episode of I owe this. Is it in Byrdu I suck? If you did, don't forget the like, but subscribe to the channel Next time for a new video Thanks so much for watching And bye Thank you."

        "text": "The Disruptor and DT are the two dumbest units in the game I'll play the Protos the entire game, but of course he just stalls and stalls with disruptors, and there's literally nothing you can do Then, of course, the T's come out and it's game over I guess I shoot a two-based tank all in Pool the Boys, because that's the only way to avoid late-game TVP I will be doing that every game from now on Shout out Big Gabe No wonder Marine Lord quit for Age of Empires Like, it's literally impossible to attack into disruptors Oh my God, I'm so tilted I'm getting a beer Name. Trasher, 97, race, Terran, Leak, Master at 14,900 MMR so that it's probably Masters one, very close to Grand Master, and the server is going to be on Europe And the question here, I guess, is, are disruptors and Dark Templar imbalanced, or do I suck? All right, and here we are in the game between Crusher and Kelsier, a French potosplea, or maybe a Scalcier, one or the two I bet it's a Frenchie Opening up with a robotics facility here is our Protos, which is usually a mistake at this level We saw a two gas opener coming out of our Tarran I don't actually like Robo that much in this type of scenario The Doble Reaper are also not really being responded to. There's no battery in either base, which kind of sucks honestly Like you really do want that because otherwise this type of stuff is going to happen You're losing mining time You're losing workers If you lose two, three workers, the game is equal Even if you don't lose mining time, you lose this much mining You lose this much mining time, you lose two, three workers That is freaking awful At the same time, Helion also and the natural Very nice little tactic here, I would say This is the type of stuff that you can literally just copy out of any top player, and it's going to work guaranteed on your level. Like this type of aggression and with the pattern as well, right? Two Reapers in the main, Helion and Innatural, 9 out of 10 times You're going to get some damage done This game is practically over at this point, getting six worker kills So I would recommend, in this case, for our Terran player to get a cyclone? No, not a cyclone Ooh, that's a big mistake actually That's a really dumb mistake as well because he scouted everything He scouted a robotics facility The cyclone is good against oracles and against Phoenix Now, the smart people at home might have realized that the Phoenix and the Oracle have something at home. I'll let all the Terrans that are currently watching this think about it for a little bit more Let's just wait five more seconds What do the Phoenix and the Oracle have in common, Terran players? Just think Right They both come out of the Stargate So if you do not see a Stargate, what do you not need to build? The Cyclone, because it is not good against anything else that isn't the Stargate unit Perfect figured that one out The moment as a Terran player you scout a robotics facility and you know there's no target in the main base either, there is no point to finish this cyclone It is almost never useful. The only other very niche scenario might be against like a three gate prism attack or in the case of a DT drop It might be useful but it still would not be my preferred unit of choice Getting a fast Raven would be good enough, especially against the DT drop And a tank is better against 3-8 prism as well So yeah, Marjorative would have seen a tank On top of that, I would have loved to see a 3-Rex build here over a triple command center You have a fantastic early game killing seven workers, basically ending the game If you follow that up with something quick, you can kind of leverage that lead that you have. Now instead, you get a third command center, then you float 700 minerals, and then you add two barracks Now, the floating, the 700 minerals, I can assure you is not a part of this build order that is due to incompetence I'm not sure what was happening at the same time I'm almost tempted to go back into time, but I also don't really care enough It's just bad macro And at 4 9K MMR, there's really no reason why you wouldn't know the timing of your second and third barracks But let me get back to the main point. If you are ahead in the early game, the best thing to do is to keep the aggression on because then you can kind of capitalize on your early game lead, the longer the game less, the less impactful that early game damage is going to be So a third TC generally is going to be considered a mistake in that case, because it allows the Protols to get back into the game by being a little bit greedy himself Maybe he'll get a couple of colossi out before you can get your first push set up If you forget your second and third wrecks altogether, I guess you give your opponent till like the eight minute mark Because these two metaphics are out at a normal timing. This is like two metaphics for a 3D wrecks timing And right now we have 10 Marines 10 Marines and a tank No stim, no combat, no plus one Like, this is obvious to me that this build order is completely improvised He dealt some damage I was like, ooh, I dealt damage I'm not quite sure what to do now, but I did remember the first four and a half minutes of a hero marine stream that I watched the other day That's not exactly how it works, all right? Not at this level Like, we're talking practically low grind master right now. We need to have build orders that somewhat make sense at this point, or we need to have fantastic mechanics where the build order kind of flows out of you You know, if you have very good mechanics, if you have money, you'll build the barracks immediately Obviously, the mechanics aren't there, so then you need to have the knowledge You need to have the pure timings in your head, whereas like, okay, at 450 I build barracks or 440, I build barracks Only very highly mechanical players can just kind of improvise like this As you're not a very strong mechanical player, once again being shown here, nothing's really happening and you're floating a solid 500 minerals for a bit Yeah, I'd recommend just no one. I'd recommend just no the timings kind of kind of by hard just just figuring them out you know it's knowing like timings or supply it's always going to be a very good like kind of a guideline of when to build stuff your initial push is going to hit late but it's still going to hit quite hard i believe you have a raven with this your opponent only has a single colossus you have a bunch of marauders already which i absolutely love here by the way um i really like uh that lately a lot of high level Terrence and apparently also our barcode player, what is he called? Trasher, Trasher, Chersher Also, he's building a lot of Marrottos. Really good against these colossi stalker styles because Marrottes just trade so well against them Love to see a little move out It would also love for you to spend your money Pratos player right now is pooping his pants, by the way Like, I am feeling bad for this Look at the Tuss has a vision of one refinery mining and nothing else There's literally zero vision on the map currently He's getting ready to be dropped in the main, he's getting ready to get blasted over at his third base Right now he's just visualizing all the different ways to die And none of them are pretty There's like awful ways to die You know, the raven flies in, interferences both of them. Entire army drops into your main base and there's a double drop in your third base The rest of the army goes towards the main There's like 70 different scenarios that basically would kill our Protos player at this moment One of the scenarios I don't think he's currently visualizing is the scenario in which you did nothing for about 40 seconds waiting for six meta-fx until going in and now you drop I still like the drop I just think this could have been executed way faster and way earlier No This was not the timing for the interference The Colossi by themselves never could have walked up this ram So you basically just waited two interference That could have was snipable as well. So far the micro gets a zero 0 out of 10 for me And here, the disruptor shot hits This was an okay time to either run back or to pick up The fight overall, well, is it actually good? No, it wasn't a good fight, but it might have been somewhat even Take a look, resource, yeah, somewhat even resources lost This should have been a completely one-sided stump Colossi never could have flanked a tank and 10 marauders It's impossible That one disruptor could have just been right-click at any point, and your raven could have still had like the 200 energy that it had before. could have built four auto turrets or just waited until the Colossi get upstairs and then interference matrix so a lot of mistakes in that initial fight on top of that you were also floating like 1200 minerals the Protos player also was floating 1800 minerals i'd like to add that people always say well harsh them it's also about how bad the the other player is that also proves imbalance and by paying attention to that i just want to you know just plan the flag there for everyone to see i just want to say hey um yes the protos also did not macro perfectly the proz that's very point map vision he's trying his best to get some map vision but he's simply not allowed map vision currently because well terence been on the map this entire time he's probably going to continue being on the map for the entire time as well a couple of vikings 3-3 upgrades or 3-2 upgrades probably should start asap this is a fight you could definitely take like 100% you can take this you can no you can snipe them you know you don't have to run away from them right you are allowed to kill this raptor as well. Maybe he thinks disruptors are holy or something like that It is possible He doesn't realize he can right-click disruptors Maybe he doesn't know how much HP they have He never killed one for like a million HP I also wouldn't mind ghosts at this point Probably a little bit earlier already I think with Dispush, oh, Liberators before Ghost That's a big no-no for me That is a very big no-no for me Ooh The ghost for Taryn is kind of like It's Okay, imagine you're going to a pub quiz, okay? And you have three friends John, the university, finished his engineering degree Then you get Jacob, you know, quit after high school, started working full-time, lays down solar panels on top of people's roof. Pretty, pretty clever guy, though And the final friend that you have is Albert Einstein If your pop quiz covers physics, it'd be a good thing to take Einstein there It's the same with ghost in the Terran army Yes, Marines and Marauders are pretty smart, and you might want to have them with you But freaking Einstein, you're not going to leave behind And Einstein in this case is the ghost The ghost is the ultimate unit that Terran has This is a good fight, by the way, for Terran If this army would also be in the main or at a different location, that would be sick. Basically what I'm trying to say is always take Einstein to a pop quiz if you have a friend that is called Einstein and he's also as smart as the original Einstein of course This is a good drop by the way, very nice drop This is beautiful stuff Actually beautiful stuff Now take out all these disruptors Also fine You clear two, you fly away Now, during all of this, it is fairly obvious what should have been happening There should have been an army over here at the fort base This army, I'm not sure why it was here I'm not sure why these marauders were down here just idling on the low ground They should have been attacking a different location. The entire point of multitasking is that multiple things are happening at the same time That's kind of, you know, it's in the word already, multi, you know, more than one thing You want to be happening So if you're trying to multitask by just dropping in your opponent's main base, that's not really multitasking It's just dropping into your opponent's main base The Liberator here is, I don't know This is I don't really like Liberators before Ghost at all Like, Ghost literally has a spell that destroys the entire Protos army Like it just cuts the HP in half by taking out all the shields If there's Archons in there, even more Like, it is crazy how good EMP is You always want to use that. So yeah, we finally get it And the thing with Liberators is, Liberators are good, but they need range and you need to have a bunch of them In that sense, they're kind of similar to fries, you know You can just eat one fry or two fries Like if you eat fries, you eat like 20, 25 of them, at least to be somewhat satisfied Now, Liberators, the numbers, it's like anything under six or seven you're not going to be satisfied with You know, you need to have two kind of rows of three liberators so you can just kind of slowly but surely leapfrog forward with these Liberators That's the entire point of the lip. It's like a unit that zones your opponent away while your bio stands behind it If they blink in, bam, you just stim in and you clear absolutely everything Your stalkers suck against bio This is an interesting use of Liberators that I haven't seen quite before It's more as a distraction unit there Maybe scaring tactic I think what's happening here is that the Terran hopes Ooh, this is a good fight for It could have been a good fight for the Taryn Who'd have a stint maybe? Hit some of the EMPs, you have a drop. What's gonna say is that I believe that our Tarran player wants the Liberator have a similar effect as the Disruptor, where the Protov sees the Liberator and goes like, oh, I can't kill that I don't want to go in there It's not quite the case because this TOS is relatively genius As I say that, this TOTS is probably going to lose this base here No more Disruptor shots available Super Battery It's not going to be enough here This is a good doubt much output This is actually nice movement as well This was a drop in the main base and then the attack over here at the fort What I said should have happened last time, now happens, immediately wins the game. Look at that 178 against 115 There's still like 2K, 1 5k in the bank as well So plenty of money for the eventual Battlecruiser transition or whatever Crusher is about to do here This game is officially over for the second time Don't forget, the game has already ended on I think we could have a a game over counter maybe somewhere in one of the corners if hamster can figure out a way good way to do that this is the second time this game has been officially over if this was a best of three kelsier would be out of the tournament he lost oh two it's over but apparently it's the best of five and crusher wants to win this game a third time in a row because he's not quite capitalizing yet maybe just wants to max out well adding another command center smart what it's Artosis always say when ahead get further ahead Very true And where did that get autosis as the mainstakeaster at the G S Very true Very, very true. And constantly raging at Protos as well on a stream This is so f***k up So these are two things that are considered positive What else do we have here? Okay, Goat, moving out I like that Okay, in reality, what should be happening right now is a massive F2 and just A moving across the map I think you could probably close your eyes while fighting Probably actually You stim, you EMP, you can't miss EMP, they cover the entire screen The actual radius, the radius, the radius, the radius, the radius of the EMP with the enhanced shockwave is so big that you literally can click on the mini map and you cover entire parts of the mini-er. You just, you click over here and the entire Protos army has no shields left It's completely fine It's completely fine No worries there Darks, right Right There's also DTs in this game, which is surprising because the game has been over already for a solid 14 minutes and now again for another minute and a half already Really, at any point we can still attack and straight up win the game We can attack with this army or we could drop half the army in the middle main base or send half of the army here like multitasking We could also go into Liberators This is pure Marauders at this point Well, practically pure Marauder Don't completely mind it Don't actually completely mind it at all. Kind of like it even I think that's a cool move Triple disruptors being built is an army consisting of seven disruptors right now We have more Liberators on the way I feel like in the past minute, all that has really happened is that our terror The veteran player secured a 6th base, built three more command centers, and got this watchtower, but lost 10 supply while the opponent gained 60 supply I don't think this was a good use of our time Now then again, I am a master procrastinator, so I don't know too much about using your time efficiently Holy crap, that was bad. That exact same fight could have happened a minute and a half ago, except then there only would have been four disruptors and no stalkers with this I'm not sure why we waited an entire 70 supply to lose our entire army to three disruptor shots Could have done that way faster? Started producing Liberators already Holy crap, that was bad If you know that you don't know how to micro going into a higher liberator count probably is the correct call because you need the micro less You have range advantage or you go into like the multitasking stuff Disruptors are really bad when they're split up They're great against bigger armies because it's easier to hit something. But just split your army in two and just kind of multitask against your opponent Every single time you've multitasked so far, things have gone relatively well I like this setup This setup is actually quite good You don't need to be like you can be here right now you don't have to be in range of the disruptors you just can be a little bit back this is this actually was a good fight this was a it was not brilliant but it was good enough same time zealots dealing a decent amount of damage here and this is where we see the real terran multitasking you know who are they being defended by what are they sieging They really hate this rich Vespine geyser. He did Salas dealing a lot of damage actually A lot of damage is being dealt here Like, that's this Like, you need to support your liberators They're not a unit that can just stand by themselves Like, they're part of a bigger thing, you know? StarCraft 2 is a lot about, like, having an army composition with units that have some type of synergy in a way Holy crap This entire thing was actually insane The supply is literally swapped And we need to talk a little bit about this We have a couple of things here First of all, the Liberators, okay? If you're using the Liberators to zone, you need to have a bio army with it. The Liberator by itself is a kind of a useless unit It is, the Liberator is a little bit like Steve Jobs It doesn't wear a turtleneck or cool shoes But what the Liberator does do is he will works very well in a team with other people, you know? If you just have Steve Jobs, you just have a guy talking about weird stuff, like, I want the phone and you must be able to swipe and do other things If no one builds the phone, it makes those sense It's the same with the Liberator If the Liberator is just sieging up over here, but there's no bio behind it to back up that circle of freedom of the Liberator, then there's no point. You need to have some backup It's part of a composition You're just consistently using these Liberators as a solo unit and it makes no sense whatsoever It's not a solo unit That's what the battle cruiser, if you want to just control one unit at a time, you play mass battle cruiser every single game from this point on now But this has absolutely not been it On top of that, I just like to note, I would personally, I find this interesting and the word funny, you know, would enter my mind maybe, is that there are some Terrans, like our current Taryn who have the greatest multitasking in the world when they're in control. But when they're the defender and they're not the one in control anymore, all of a sudden multitasking is non-existent There's absolutely no second control group to defend anything When they're dropping at the start two places at the same time, I'm so much faster any stupid protos, with an ape brain No Taryn, this is a little bit when you have like a younger brother You're like 10 years old your younger brother is five years old You know, you wrestle with him, you destroy like arm bars, leg logs, absolutely crushing this kid Like, he stands no chance whatsoever Because you're five years old, you're just stronger You're the one in control, you know Now, fast forward, you're 25. You're national champion in Dorito eating and mountain d'ew drinking Your little brother is hitting the gym 15 times a week There's like mixed martial art practice six times as well, then all of a sudden that wrestling ain't that fun anymore because you're not in control anymore and you look pretty weak That's exactly what's happening here Look at this None of this is being microed None of the defense is being done either because all of a sudden the toss is in control This toss looked a little bit bad because he never was in control. But now that he's in control of this game and it literally ends the moment the control of who was in control of this game swapped, the supply is also completely reversed and the Terran started looking like a bit of a newbie here It's really sick how that works and this is fairly often the case, especially at the somewhat lower levels where the moment people know what they're doing and You know that they're really in control of the situation They can work with a lot of momentum They're usually destroying their opponent, but the moment something weird happens You know they get caught of guard all of a sudden they aren't that brilliant anymore. It's completely the case here And you're still and you have 8k minerals in the bank Surely you you could get back into it if you if you try really hard hard And one of the cool things that you could potentially do here, I'm not saying that it would win you the game, but one of the best ways to get rid of pressure on you is by trying to counter attack with something And this can be very small things I'm talking just queue up three liberators for all I care You have four liberators right now Send one behind this base Send one behind this base Send one behind this base. Cue up a double drop to the left side, you know? Just make sure that your opponent feels the need to defend Because the moment your opponent is maybe you get some time to, you know, to crank out a couple of units again Basically what the ProDos had been doing, you know? He basically reversed this game with that single Zillodrun by completely ruining your micro, your macro, and your Liberator gas siege up, whatever it was Now, at this point, the Protos has completely won the game This game is now 2-1 So if this was a best of three, once again, Art Terran still would have won In a best of five, all of a sudden there's some combat potential. At least I'm feeling some comeback potential here And the Terran also is making no moves to try and get back into the game He's making no moves in general because it's pretty dead, but no moves to get back in the game He's basically just continuing the same way he was while he was winning And let's not forget that when he was up 90 supply, our Terran player didn't manage to finish the game or get to a better position for himself Basically, continuing the same thing here is insane It makes no sense It went poorly already when you were super far ahead Why would it go well all of a sudden now that you're 70 supply behind? Like that is a 140 supply difference. Initially up 70 supply and now down 70 supply Like the difference there in situation is insane You obviously need to switch up the pace So this is a move that I like And the funny thing is that the Oh God, here we go I have a bad feeling about these liberators already I don't know why, but the way that they sieged up, it hurt me a little bit Oh? Oh, yeah, I can't defend that actually Nah Can't defend this Pick up, pick up, pick up Pick up Pick up Pick up into the main Boom Okay, I'm going to do that in slow motion Look at this Look at this The correct move, but the execution here. I don't think this still counts as the same move He's trying to load up a bunch of grandmas into a bus with the speed this was Holy crap This maneuver starts at 2437, 2438 Look at this One, two, three Huh? Still these two behind Takes four seconds Four seconds to load up units and it still has two marauders stuck on the low ground That is unbelievable If something takes four seconds in a game of StarCraft 2, it better be done perfectly It better be done perfectly This was absolutely not done perfectly TTs now being dealt with in an okay way This army obviously should be moving towards the bottom side at the same moment because we want to get back into the game. We want to multitask instead of multitasking, we're looking at our main army right now and we're losing it because there is 35 disruptors and a massive army shooting at it The space that we have created is not being used whatsoever Not being used whatsoever Now maybe we start moving down I don't even think that's going to be the case Honestly, this is still very winnable for the Taron Like Protos mining sucked for a long time There's a lot of money in the bank still How's this DT still alive? Oh my God It's like Surely the priority is not getting another orbital here, we're just getting any outside basis Like, sitting at home right now just allows the opponent to move across the map. This is another little bit of theory, which apparently this Terran hasn't learned yet Trusher Trasher Whatever he's called Disruptors freaking suck at defending, especially against Liberators But attacking, Disruptors are the greatest unit in the world You just shoot two disruptor shots, walk or like rotate Shoot two more, rotate Shoot two more, rotate Consistently getting free damage If you're defending something, all of a sudden you're forced to shoot four or five disruptor shots at a time, while Liberators are zoning your main army away, and that unit isn't as brilliant anymore Is really utilizing the Ranger of the Liberator? Didn't even know it was possible to range it up with this little range forward It's like minus one It's actually insane to watch this. No counter pressure whatsoever this entire time This was a good move It was a little bit, but the control there was quite good I really did like that Once again, the possibility to just leave, look at this I'm just suggesting moves here, okay? Siege up five, six liberators over here Three on this side, three on this side or something like that And just stim your entire arm army to the bottom right All the other units that get created right now just send towards the left side immediately The moment you get attacked into a planetary, you have the liberators to defend in this general area If your opponent tries to go for the throat, you siege all your liberators on top of your ramp. It's really difficult to break that Six liberators on top of a ramp with plus two, even if you have 27 stalkers, if there's just as little as like basically five, six marauders on top of the ramp, it's so, so hard to break this type of stop It's so hard to do it By the time you shot the first three Liberators, you already lost like 10, 12 stalkers And don't forget that there's also an army killing your Nexus at the same time, but you need to make a move You can't just sit there, just tanking shots And look at this, army moving exactly where I thought it was going to, because this is the correct call for Protos. The correct call is to go to the outside base. So you could have defended this with Liberators, with the planetary as your backup unit, then at the same time, counterattack. Your counterattack starts so extremely late, my friend. So extremely late. It's It's actually painful to see. Like the moment you realize something happens, that's when you start going. You should be anticipating moves out of your opponent, like a little bit of game stands, or get a sensor tower, which is practically MULE. It's also fine. Look, kill the base for free. And you kept your base alive at the same time just by dealing some counterpressure, just like that. It's beautiful, isn't it, how that works? Now, this army that you just reinforced to this position makes no sense Once again, I'm just going to show it once more. this army that reinforced should not be joining up with this army the moment you can be backed into a corner the protos can chase you all the way just around and then attack while it's chasing your army into a defensive position so you always need to stay aggressive on the map if you're not staying aggressive on the map how you're ever going to do any damage how you're ever going to spend the money that you have you need time right now you need to buy a lot of time you also have so much energy holy crap Drop a couple of mules, man You're 16 mules available for you No more It's like 20 mules Holy crap, I like this move. It should have been with some marauders, though And a MataVac, probably You leave for your You leave you learn First the lips All out of position Disadvantage on not having censor towers and no game sense Yeah Censor tower, honestly, is a bit of a replacement for game sense, but There's no point This game is actually over This game has been over for a while now I really did believe that there was like three, four extra possibilities to go, but it seems like this game is, yeah, it's actually completely over We'll just speed this up a little bit because I have no hope for this Terran anymore. And I also have no hope that this Terran is going to leave the game at a responsible time Because that is not something that Terran players are known for Whatsoever Oh, nice, nice liberator She's, holy crap I wanna see that again This is a siege and a half He's not even attacking the tower It just makes no sense I don't know Like, this type of stuff, I just can't understand it I just don't understand it Like this Terran obviously has some concepts, but stops using them the moment he gets ahead Like the initial multitasking wasn't that bad At some point, the one drop into the main base and then the attack on the 4th was really good was really good. I like that a lot But after that, I haven't seen a single good decision in this game Like, not a single one, except for that one All the other decision making was just bad It was slow The response time was very slow Look at the preemptive force fields I mean, could have just lifted over it, I guess, but it might have been too much I guess he's seen the lift from over from earlier over there He's like, I'm no shot This guy's trying to lift again They didn't go too hot the first time around Ah, no way No way Four point 9K No Gigi No Gigi either Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah No G Disruptor and Dark Templar. My good friend, you complain about the disruptor and the Dark Templar But what you're forgetting here is that you already won 2O in this single game before a single disruptor Maybe half a disruptor hit the field Maybe half a, not DTs didn't end until like 18 minutes You already lost to the zealots DTs, we completely leave the DTs out The DTs did not matter in this game The Zellet run by completely killed you Sell it run by and the micro, whatever you did on the bottom side, that was game over for you The disruptors, however, I understand that the disruptor is a frustrating unit. It's difficult to micro against, but not a single time in this entire game have you used the disadvantage of the disruptor, which is either splitting up your army You know, you did it once and it went very well, but never again after You're like, oh, that went way too well Wouldn't want that to happen again It might accidentally increase my TVP win rate that I can't complain anymore on the Betonet forums because people will see my profile where was I? Right Not a single time after that one time did you split your army Not a single time did you use liberators correctly either to push your base. Every single time you used liberators they either were zoning an area without support or there was just no support anyway and they were just chilling there for some reason often misseged as well Your ghost were very late on top of that as well which are great against disruptors because they remove half of the overall health of the unit It's like, look, I understand complaining about disruptors and that they're annoying It's difficult to micro against, but you had so many opportunities here to finish the game before it You had so many opportunities to actually fight properly against the disruptor as well, and you never did it So I can't really say that it's a disruptor that's imbalanced No, my friend, you just suck. That's how it is All right That's going to be it for today's episode of is it imba or do I suck And the one thing that I will agree with with Mr Crusher is that, oh my God, I'm so tilted I'm getting a beer I'm not tilted, but I'm going to get a beer I recommend all of you do the same thing and watch another video Hit the like button, subscribe to the channel And I'll see all of you next time Ciao, chow."

        "text": "Greetings Captain Kevin I come in search of aid against the force so fast and deadly, they are essentially untouchable Yes, Kevin, I am talking about the zircling These little buggers are so fast they can only be caught by the one unit you don't want to use against them The phoenix So how on earth is Proto supposed to deal with it? I open double stargate Phoenix as I find it easiest to use a consistent and survivable form of harassment to harass as I struggle to use methods which would require 300 plus APM to use sufficiently like glaive adepts The problem comes when the Zerk sends out its dreaded Zirklings in mass to kill my bases. My void race, Archons, Adepts and Zellets cannot even hope to cut through the links before I lose my third, my fourth, my third and my third again That's the third base three times for the people that were counting. usually I would attack with charge slots once my opponents get sufficient hydras or corruptors to ward away my phoenixes but Kevin how on earth am I supposed to keep the zirk in check with a ground army if I cannot even keep the zirk in check at my own basis please if there is a better way to keep the zirk in check whilst defending against this insane unit teach me signed you well not you but the player who submitted it balanced complaint form is called you The race is Protos, the league is masters with 4 5k MMR, and the server is Australia Now, that means that the person who submitted is a bit of an idiot because the Australian server doesn't really exist anymore. We have the server split in three, and there are some sub-servers within the North American region, including Singapore I'm not even sure if there's still actually an Australian sub-region I think they might have just removed that altogether, but I could be wrong There's like six people that play in Australia, and you apparently is one of them User Protos, opened up with a gate scout here, and struggles mightily with zirklings And from what I could gather, especially the speed of the zirklings, right? He mentioned that the phoenix is the only unit that could catch up up with the Ling Now, that doesn't say too much in a game of war. Like, there are people and there are things that are very fast, but are not necessarily good at war Like, imagine if you have a Formula One car, it's a very, very fast car and probably great to have, I mean, fun to drive around with But if someone shoots at you with a tank while you're in a Formula One car, you'll probably die no matter how fast you are Or someone snipes you down while you're sitting in your little car Like, it's not meant for heavy fighting You know, you could probably drive into someone and deal some significant damage It's the same with links They're very fast, but they're honestly kind of useless in a straight-up fight majority of the time. They do well against small harassment forces And in very large numbers, links can take out things like zealots, stalkers, adapts But once splash comes into play, and especially Storm or Archons, even, the unit becomes weird Okay, sorry I can't quite recall how I wanted to The unit becomes worse, is what I want to say I completely lost my train of thought when I saw Okay, what is this? Stargate got built 34 seconds ago So this is a Stargate pre-warpgate, a very standard build order Whenever you play Stargate, you want to delay your warp gate Okay, that is pretty normal That way you get a faster initial Stargate unit However, I've never, ever seen a chronobo boost on the warp gate afterwards. This either is like some fake or just a terrible build order, or both a fake and a terrible builder And the follow-up here makes even less sense because there's not going to be a stalker So basically, you're pretending to be doing some type of gate rush or like some gateway-focused rush because you're croning out the warp gate Then you don't get a stalker to the nice sky and you allow your opponent to see that you build a Stargate So you just wasted an entire chrono boost You're the guy at the poker table You, you are the guy at the poker table who wears like the big black sunglasses thinking he's so smart and no one can read me They can't see my eyes. But in reality, your glasses have massive reflection And everyone knows exactly what you have Like, that's what you are Or that's what you is, I guess It's difficult when someone is called you completely messes with your head Completely messes with it Anyway, this entire build order so far has been hot garbage I'm not even entirely sure how it's possible, but despite this being a single void ray opener and a single gate expansion, this Nexus still went down at the four minute mark, rather than at like 3 45 or 350 I'm not quite sure how that is possible there must have been something very wrong There's no worker production, so maybe he missed a couple of workers earlier on, just losing some money. That is a possibility Why is there no second gas yet? If you're playing double Stargate, like the limiting factor here obviously is going to be gas So you need to rush out the gas There's also no worker The worker cuts are really insane This is not on purpose, I don't think I also don't think this gas being so delayed is on purpose Look at this I gotta move that back Also, it's a bad position It feels like everything here is being done at a very low speed and improperly Like just so many small errors here Not the unit on hold position, the gas too late, the units not properly hold positioned between the Pylon and the Nexus. I'm not quite sure what this Voyeurysra was doing, but I guess it was having a little adventure by itself on the other side of the map So these links by themselves killed three workers They scouted entirely what's going on They forced an entire mineral line to pull away from mining as well Like these links were so insanely worth it And just even if it was only the scout that they had gotten, this would have been good for the Zerk as well Especially given the fact that TOS for whatever reason just keeps cutting workers out I'm not entirely sure why this happens. I kind of want to go in first person view here to see what we're, focusing on like 135 apm against 326 so we're focusing on phoenixes this weird little attack this attack is hitting very late with very little as we do get a little bit of drone harassment going here which is nice no workers being produced behind this loses the void ray here didn't see it but i saw the the body of the Voidre actually fall over and does get a little bit of damage Now, the funny thing here is this was good damage, right? It was fine damage You kill five workers, which is nice But behind this, there was a worker cut at 53 for almost 40 seconds, which is insane. So all the damage that you just did, come on, move once again, out of position All the damage that you just managed to do and deal to your opponent is now practically worthless because you didn't continue producing It, like the entire thing just, it makes no sense It says if you're in a cooking competition and both of you need to bake a cake and when your opponent isn't paying attention, you freaking smash his cake and just destroy it, completely ruined And then you look back at your own oven and you realize you've done nothing yet This is basically this game Like you deal a little bit of damage or a lot of damage maybe. even, depending on what your definition of a lot of damage is I think five workers with 10 phoenixes is not that much damage yet But you're just not doing anything yourself How is it possible that we're seven minutes and 26 seconds in game and you haven't saturated one of your gases yet on your third base? Mate, I would be considering taking my gases at my fifth at this point You probably don't even have a camera holtkey for your fourth base yet because you don't even, you probably can't take it This is actually insane Everything is happening so slow It makes no sense The basic scale of worker production is one of the most important skills in StarCraft 2. And the moment something else happens for you, you just stop using it You're just, all right, workers, not that interesting I'm not going to get them anymore It's bad It really is bad On top of that, you've only killed 13 workers despite building 13 phoenixes already This is a huge investment And the funny thing about Phoenixes is that eventually most likely you're going to get damage But it's important to get the damage as quickly as possible So your opponent also has less mine, right? If you kill 20 workers at the 5 minute mark, that's a lot more impactful than if you kill 20 workers at like the 9 minute mark when there's a 3K bank already. I don't understand how it's possible that your adepts are literally always out of position You know, they have these experiments where they have like a monkey pick stocks at the start of the year and then they match the monkey up against the like financial experts And I think for like years straight, the monkey would outperform the financial experts I feel like if we could make a monkey put these adepts in positions around the map, he'd still be in position more often than you have been so far Not a single time have your adepts used any time of SimCity Look, once again, you're just out in the open. The Zerg actually could have just fought it, taken out every single zealot, which, by the way, none of them were in range of the battery. Maybe one of them was in range of the battery. You would have lost all your zealots. And once again, you never would have been capable. Look, you just keep doing it. You just keep staying out of position. I don't even understand how it's possible to always be out of position. Like said. By pure luck, you should be able to be in position more often than not. Well, not more often than not, but at least every now and again. Again, like, okay, I just, okay, I literally do not understand this. I, you got to explain this to me. If someone understands this, please explain it to me You just see 25 links move towards this side You see them escape through this general area So it is safe to assume that the links are going to be somewhere on this side of the map Then you send a single propout to secure this base If the Zerk was even semi-active with those links, he would have gotten an instant cancel, an instant cancel, because your army doesn't move there Whenever you go somewhere, you need to secure that base if you know your opponent's units are there And you knew you had the full information It's like you don't have object permanence. The moment they move into the shadows, you completely lose track of where the links were last Like, it makes no sense whatsoever Now you're lucky because the Zerk wasn't paying attention Had the Zerk been there already, this base would have been cancelled once again, 100% Like absolutely no shot. your phoenixes just went back for this as well for whatever reason to try and harass some of these zirklings this is going to be probably a very good fight for you as archons do hard counter zirgling so this a couple of corruptors can recall the phoenixes could also super battery this and move over with your archons could also warp in four stalker not super battery and not use a recall so you lose your third base for free it's a very interesting move and one that personally i wouldn't have recommended or suggested but you really are opening my eyes to the possibilities in this game this is good harassment though it's a little bit late but finally you're getting something done i wish this would have happened well four minutes earlier but it is what it is and you're getting a lot of worker kills actually are in a pretty decent spot once again you're completely out of position just literally always managing to be at the wrong side there's no base here yet there is a base here completely undefended links come in recall is available but I doubt it's going to be used. Maybe you doesn't have a hotkey for a recall actually Like this is, to me, this entire sequence of events just has been insane And then to complain about the Arkon or the Zellet as a unit that gets countered by the Ling makes no sense This is almost as if you had a sniper rifle, okay, and your goal is to assassinate someone But rather than chasing the target that you need to assassinate, you're spying on your neighbor because you're secretly in love with the person that lives next to you So you're spying them in their backyard pool Then the target that you're supposed to assassinate gets away and you start complaining about how bad your sniper rifle is. Well, this is not what a sniper rifle is supposed to be used for And also, you weren't even really trying to fight with it Like, you're using it as a scope, which is fine I mean, maybe something beautiful will grow out of your forioristic relationship with your neighbor But honestly, if she ever sees you control stuff like this, I don't think there's any future there Once again, taking a fort base, completely undefended It is actually impressive And it's going to just get cancelled again It does get the cancel down That's important Does save a little money This attack, I kind of like, honestly I think it's a good attack Arcons completely destroy links. if you would have had a couple of extra zealids in front of this, it probably would have been even better But even now, you're going to be in an okay spot Like five extra zealots just for the tanking power, so your archons can just shoot more It really, really helps against links Lings lose one Arcon for free Lose a couple more zealots for free because they're not together with this army Take out this base I like the priority setting here right now It's like, huh, I'm basically doing a desperation all-in attack at the moment. I bet the main target for me is going to be these two extractors on my opponent's third base while I know there's a fourth base and I also know that there's a fifth base surely this is the key thing that I need to be paying attention to right now and you just, okay this is great there's a complete A move back and these units continued attacking the extractors that was actually kind of scary because the links that come in first around I guess which they do right now you're just going to lose every single unit yeah this is also why having a couple extra zealous is just super useful Phoenixes are still alive and this is this game is really wild 12 minutes in still no 4th base floating 1. 2k 1K1K Zirk also is floating a decent chunk by the way I don't want to say that this Zerk player is absolutely perfect but you definitely aren't perfect like very very very far from perfect You know the song by Ed Sheeran perfect? No one really knows who it is about, but with the process of elimination, maybe we can sometime figure it out And I know for sure that the song isn't about you We can send that in If anyone has the contact to Ed Sheeran or to the Ed Sheeran fan club who've been keen on figuring out who the song is about, we can take you of the list Plus two on the way I like this It's a good move. It would have been better if it would have been on five minutes ago Ooh, this is nice as well Look that I just want to see that again How he moves into a surround Look at that This is one of these things that you don't think is quite possible You're like, how is this Arkham going to get on the right side of this set of links without killing anything? And we're about to see it Look at this What? Huh? How does it move? How does it move? Whiggles its way in like a worm into the earth Actually, I think worms eat with their. Do they have a mouth? I think they bite it actually No, they have jolves maybe worms I'm quite sure others I know they can dig pretty fast They don't have a They must have a mouth How often do they eat? I don't know enough about worms Anyway, you see Ultras So you should be getting immortals Or getting anything to deal with it At this point Having the phoenixes at home Is really no point And funnily enough Is if you had the phoenixes On the other side of the map You probably could be winning this game And the reason I'm saying this is because you could have just killed every single worker for free There's four queens and there's seven corruptors. You also have plus one Ooh, there's plus two carapace I'm pretty sure with 11 Phoenixes and a void rate, you're going to be capable of taking out seven corruptors You know that you won't be capable of winning this fight Phoenixes can deal with these ultralists So you need to make a mature decision here and say, okay, I don't want to hold my fort base for a little bit, but I'm going to kill every single worker on my opponent's side while I'm slowly but surely, transitioning into something that can actually kill my opponent's units, which is going to be the immortals The robotics facilities here are actually the correct call I like that The problem is that you have no units left right now. Absolutely none whatsoever No cancel either Kind of painful It feels like the phoenixes have been harassing so little because every time there is somewhat of a threat on your side of the map And whether you need the phoenixes or not, doesn't even matter The moment there's a threat, you just kind of F2 them back or at least you send them back I'm not sure if you use F2 I don't think this adept has moved that much during the game Yeah, this Imagine this happening like before you lose every single arc on Also, I think you send out a Zellet run by earlier, despite your opponent being on three base, which isn't entirely brilliant I forgot to mention that. It's important to keep that in your memory as well All the mistakes I remember all of them I mean, at this point, there's like a single arc on It's hard Even if you wouldn't have lost the archons on the right side, it would have been hard It's going to be even harder if you're not playing on attacking with the Archon I do get something done here in the end Maybe with three Archons could have held There is a world. There legitimately is a world where if you have four Arcons in this area and you killed like 30 extra drones, which would have been possible given the energy on your phoenixes, you have one immortal out and a void ray, you defend with your super battery at your third I can see a world where you actually win this game with a super battery That's not this world, apparently This was a really confusing game Not only because this is Masters and it didn't look like a Masters game whatsoever from the Protos side, but also just because the entire complaint made no sense It's not like he spent the majority of the game chasing links around the map. Majority of the time, what happened was that the army was out of position, there was zero map vision whatsoever, the unit comp initially was okay, but it just never was there to fight the links It's just a very weird complaint in my mind because the speed of the rotations didn't even matter because majority of the time there were no rotations It was just an attack on the same spot three times in a row and then a rotation This has way more to do with vision than it has to do with rotational speed, which is the one thing that I guess you were complaining about I'm not even sure what you're complaining about. Is it that the Zurglings are too strong? because that definitely wasn't the case Every single time you fought with arcons, you destroyed the links Every time you were in position, you held your base extremely easily The only thing that you could complain about is maybe that it's difficult to get map control if your opponent has this many links or difficult to keep track of what's happening You could also just pre-split your army This is perhaps a foreign concept to you because it requires more than one control group But if you have three arcons in one base and three in the airmen, other and you have batteries at both, no amount of links is ever going to get through that It's simply impossible. Bainlings are going to be a necessity or some type of roach raveger Otherwise, like, link against batteryed arcons, it just doesn't work It feels like you're complaining about something that wasn't an issue whatsoever And thus, I can't do anything else but say that you, my friend, suck And zirklings are not imbalanced I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is Thank you all for watching I hope you did enjoy this episode of Is It Inba?

        "text": "Oh, Captain, my Captain, I have failed to achieve victory Again, the Protos have defeated me My micro was decent I macroed okay But alas, my ladder points were taken away Perfectly I played not Roaches I possibly should have got Other mistakes, there were a lot, those I will not try to hide Oversupply was sometimes wide Some units I lost needlessly Some minerals I spent slowly I fought valiantly, but in sadly vain, opponent just press A to bring the pain Bit by bit, Protos drives me insane At the ends of my wits, I am stuck. So tell me, Protos Inba, or do I suck? Beautiful imbalance complained poem here, coming out of Morgirth, a Zirk player in the Diamond League with 3,900-ish MMR on the European server The question is fairly simple Is Protos Inba or does he suck? And we're here to find out And what better way to find out than to just watch the game? Here on Moondance, PVZ between Tokus and, as mentioned before, Morgert, our imbalanced poem submitter Look at this What is this? He's just going to check if it's a 12 moon and head back home straight away That's a pretty cool move This isn't time for a block, by the way Sometimes you see people open up with a quick problem. Scouts and then not block and it consistently pisses me off Literally every single time I see it, it just makes me a little bit upset It really does It's just literally just scouting for a 12 pool I really, really dislike this type of play Ah, you're investing so much money into sending this Pro quickly Why don't you just do a post-Gaithway Scout? It gets you like 60 more minerals or so, 50 more minerals, and it gets you the information at a good enough time where you can still respond, Oh my God, it's a Nexus First user I know we're supposed to be looking at the Zirk player, but I hate people that build Nexus First. And it is not even because I dislike the Nexus First as a build order I actually think the Nexus First as a build order probably has some legitimacy It's a little bit like beards People, you know, beards by themselves I understand why some people have them It's annoying to shave and it might even look good on some people. but people that are into beards and like when I say into beards like really into beards you know they talk about the the oil and the different what you call like the combs they have and just all like the little beard scissors it is the moment a beard becomes a hobby you know something is wrong it's not a hobby it's facial hair it's the same with nexus first people that play nexus first a lot I always feel like there's something a little bit off with them I don't can't quite I don't know what, but they're always going to like Airtos camp or they play some other crap two-ways all in where they want four extra probes in the early game. And another thing that Nexus First players often do is that they send out a Pilen Scout and not block the hatchery This is one of those things within the Nexus First community that I absolutely hate Now I understand that Tokus can't help it, that his replay got sent in and I usually don't get upset about the opponents of the submiter but I really, really dislike Nexus first with a Pylon Scout without blocking the natural This is like extremely triggering for me It genuinely upsets me This is the type of stuff of nightmares. In my, like, my vision of what hell looks like is being forced to watch StarCraft where two Protos players play against each other and just play Pilonskout Nexus first the entire time without blocking each other's Nexus this would be legit the worst scenario that I could have in my life Let's see, did we miss anything during this? Don't think so Oh, no, actually we did miss something What is this? Two overlords being built right now Now, that's technically not necessary One overlord here would have been fine because the 52 supply block that you get as a Zerk usually gets ended by this hatchery finishing So the build order here isn't tight. Now, I'm willing to say that this was just an honest mistake and that he just double-click on the Overlord sometimes this happens when i play Zerg before uh building my first Overlord or before building my uh my Pool i built two Overlords accidentally that happens as well you know mistakes happen so i'm gonna say this is a mistake it's a bad mistake that cost you a fair amount might even delay a Queen here or there but it it does it does suck a little bit now there's something already that's pissing me off here and Okay, there's actually two things that piss me up No, there's three things that piss me off The first thing that pissed me off was the Nexus first. Then the fact that the Protols put the Stargate in the wall, which is never necessary on this map Absolutely never necessary You can just properly wall this with two buildings But what pisses me off is the fact that Morgat didn't use this information whatsoever Okay? I think he scouted the fact that this was in the wall, but then didn't use it Why are we building spore crawlers that finish at the four minute mark or 405 when you know and you can confirm that there's not going to be any Oracle until at least 520 or so? Against a single void ray, you don't need a spore And you especially don't need a spore in your natural. These could have been two drones that would still be mining And yes, I know this is nitpicking, but it's important That's two drones off of what? Like right now there's 16 drones mining here, 16 here 16 here, 32, it's like what, 6% or so, a little bit more probably, 7ish percent or so, that you could have gotten added into your eco I just don't understand how that is possible I really just don't Like, you get the info, you don't need anything And it always pisses me off when I see people, like a Protos player built a target in the wall and then the Zirk player not using it for whatever reason. Like, mate, if you get free info like this, I'm going to be abusing it, like, for sure, you know This is when back in the day there's like a vending machine We all had these vending machines, you know, the vending machine that, where the coke can was like 30 cents instead of 1 euro 30 And you just kept buying the co cans in that vending machine until they figured it out It's the same here As long as this Protos player is building the star gate in the wall, you're going to be abusing it It's a shot for open goal Why would you try and miss it? No, you take it, you get a goal and you go on with your day. Layer on the way here, which is relatively okay timing I like that I even like that we're not rushing into an Evo chamber with this heavy of a void race style I also really enjoy the amount of queens that are being built here I do have to admit that I don't entirely understand what has gone wrong, but I know that something has gone wrong here on the, on the Zirk side, because the work account feels relatively low while having zero units whatsoever Two links have been built in total, and yet it feels like the work account should have been a bit higher Maybe it's just a feeling, and maybe I'm wrong It just, it feels a bit off. I can't quite put my finger on what went wrong Maybe we're lacking an inject here or there It doesn't quite seem to be the case And would be weird as well, because really nothing has happened in this game Crete spread so far is looking, is it good? It's fine This is nothing has happened yet, creeps bread You know? What is it? Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face And right now, Morgan hasn't been punched in the face yet Now, there is one thing here that I kind of want to be critical of again And that kind of ties into the being punched in the face. So before you get punched in the face, you really should try to make sure that no one can punch you in the face and if you know your opponent is messing void rays, one of the things that that includes is spreading out links around the map to know where void rays are coming from Now, that sounds like a lot of work, and on a map like this, you probably need to spread six links If you don't want to do that, another thing you can do is preemptively spread out queens in like a 4-4 or 5-5 split depending on how many queens you have Because right now, there is 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 queens over here. You have 1 queen, so there's like 7 queens, basically, that are not very near the main base And these void rays are probably headed towards the main base area, and that could be an issue Another thing is if you don't pre-split, ideally you probably want maybe four over here and then four over here, or four over here and four over here, is that your opponent can start bouncing between bases So right now these void rays, they can probably take it like maybe a couple of drones We'll go for a layer Maybe? I think the transfusers should be fine Maybe too late It's going to be pretty close at least It's going to be really close. Yeah, I think this is a bad move out of TOS So this actually is going to be a fine trade, but that doesn't mean that you didn't make a mistake You should have either pre-spread or you should have had vision around the map because vision is really important against higher void ray numbers They often come in, they kill stuff really quickly, like your layer did go down And if this protest would have been a bit better, he could have popped between the main base and this fort and definitely got on a cancel on the fourth base without losing four or was it five for a void race. So, yeah, not a huge fan of it generally of having all queens in the exact same group, just kind of standing forward on the creep or all being used as one unit I don't think that is the correct play This is also a big one This is the type of stuff that makes very little sense to me This is after something has happened already, pretending like it's going to happen again two seconds later, despite the information being fully available that no more void rays are being produced right now You could just pop in here and know that that's not the case These hydras right now are defending nothing. This is like, this is virtue signaling basically, saying, oh, we're so safe in the main base We love regulations It's like this is completely useless There's no more void rays going to show up And these units should be at the front right now defending other base or at least being in a more central position So the moment things like DTs come in, you actually have Has something of a DTis Another interesting move out of Morgard What is this? Hey, this is I'm gonna have to show this again It's unbelievable So drones and DTs, for the people that are not aware, have the exact same movement speed I believe it's 3 94 or 3 9 5 movement speed. So this means that if you're a drone and you see a DT, you can run away and the DT will not be capable of catching it unless you're going around corners Whenever 4 DTs move into a drone line, the best thing to do usually is to run away with the drones It is not the fight It is a bit as if you're in the shower, you know, naked without any weapons And a guy with a massive blade, a two-sided blade and a weird looking cloak comes into your shower and he leaves the door open so you have the possibility to run but your decision is to grab the shampoo bottle and start hitting him with it. Yes, it might hurt a little but the moment his blade touches you, you're probably dead It would have been better to run And with a large blade it's also fairly difficult to run So yeah, I'd recommend running if you want to stay alive Then hold positioning near the spore I guess the reason for that is because you don't want the sport to die Make some sense after you lost the layer actually Yeah, it was a good call I liked that I was going to say it makes no sense, but no, that actually makes sense In a normal situation, I would say that is the incorrect call It's best to always just run away But in this scenario, hold positioning around the spore afterwards. If you lose the spore, you probably just lose the base So I don't mind the call completely Good stuff Game right now is in favor of or immortal being produced There's not that many units for TOS There's quite some freedom for ZERC as well, which is a resource that you can't really see in, in like any of these tabs But freedom basically, what I kind of count as that, is the ability to build drones without being annoyed So right now, Zirk probably has another like 15 to 20 drones where they'll be capable of building those without truly being annoyed Like they have plenty of units to deal with any threat coming their way in the next I want to say minute or so. Definitely the next minute or so So yeah, you can go up to 80 to 81 workers And that's exactly what's happening here I think that's the correct call here out of Morgan I think this is the incorrect call And it also doesn't make any sense The way that Zirk works or the way that in general attack optimization tends to work is that Okay, this made absolutely, this was a really bad move does manage to snip the prison, but it still was a really bad move The way that attack optimization works is the moment that you stop droning is the moment you're the weakest with your army, right? Because you've been building drones and now your eco is boosted from all those drones. You need to wait a little bit for that to pay off And then you can get a lot of production, you'll get a lot of money So usually you want to, after you stop droning, you need some time to create an army attacking straight away after stopping droning is a completely nonsensical play that I'm not really down with I actually think that is a fairly big mistake And also losing our good friend Morga, the bunch of hydras, which is expensive Hydras, whenever you lose hydras, you're losing the ability to attack later on in the game because they're so expensive when it comes to gas as well. We really do need to see, A, extra upgrades on these Evo chambers, B, an infestation pit, a Lurker Dan, just any type of tech that eventually starts dealing with large numbers of robo units because, well, let's face it, the opponent is building three robotics facilities and it's producing from basically all of them There's Arcons on the way as well So yeah, upgrades and I think infestation pit before Lurker then would be correct here as the Lurker than without the Seismic Spines and without the Adaptive Talents upgrade is not actually that useful Colosses even outrange lurkers if lurkers don't have their own range upgrade, which feels extremely wrong I do like this I think this is a brilliant move. Ooh, too much is being split off But I think in general, oh, he just didn't know the army was there Oh no I take every word I just said back No way Okay Okay I thought that this was a counterattack that was being set up here out of the Zirk to basically deal some damage while the Protos is standing on the edge of the creep But what happened in reality is that the Zerk has so little map control and so little map vision, so little understanding, that the Zerk actually wanted to attack This wasn't an attempt of an attack. Our Zerk player was going to all in and now realize, hey, wait a second, I'm actually being still attacked, but literally no vision on this army whatsoever Good control on the Baines Connecting with all of those zealots was important So despite the map vision being terrible The actual fighting here was pretty good The transfuses were good The bailings connected with the correct units You want to move the queens a bit forward to tank some of these colossus shots But overall, this was honestly a very decentish fight here for Zerk I kind of like that I mean, losing that base sucked. If there actually had been a Ling run by happening at the same time or a bailing run by at one of these bases, I think this game would now be over in favor of the Zirk player, but because that's not the case, it's still going to be a little bit yikesy in my opinion Good positioning again I'm actually kind of impressed by the fighting skills here of Morgert Morgert said that that his micro suck, or wasn't as brilliant, but I actually think the control so far in this game has been quite good Okay, this is obviously bad, losing every single link to DTs Some stuff is being killed in here Ooh, these could morph into Baines later on. Very little supply for the toss right now And here's another cool trick that you can do is when the Protos player is completely distracted, you could attack another area at the same time Here we see some classic non-multitasking where things are happening in a sequence basically or like in order So, oh, I want to see if this was a decision or if this was just bad multitasking So basically right now, if you're already causing chaos somewhere else, if you're already causing chaos somewhere else, you want to do it at the same time in a second location to complete it and you can often deal a lot of damage I want to just see if this is okay, this was a decision. It's always important to note whether people are slow or if they're really dumb In this case, Morgan is just really dumb He looked at that fight, saw the Super Battery, saw the Colossus with 2-1 upgrades and was like, yeah, 50 links Those are the units that I want to send into those three colossi It's a huge error Massive mistake What is this? The prioritization here is not brilliant Luckily no response out of the Protos 47 workers left by the way for TOS, which means that right now Zerk is winning in a huge, huge way, absolutely However, the tech still massively sucks I mean, we're still on a layer We have a lurker then without like rates. We're actually building lurkers, which I think is probably the only way to lose this game Lurkers without range don't actually deal damage There's no more bailings remaining, which means that zealots all of a sudden are good again as well And we're building 56 links So some debatable decisions are being made here by Morgut, despite being in a close to unloosable position At least, to me it feels like a close to unloosable position Okay It's losing a lot of these hydras The problem with zealots is that zealots are actually good against hydras if there's nothing to defend them And if you just have like five bailings here, that's already a completely different fight These zealots are not having a good time at all. And then you keep some hydras alive There's no observer though No, there are observers They're just, well, they're not even slow They just weren't with the army This feels bad all of a sudden for Morgers Earth Like this was a very, very poor fight and just purely based on the lack of upgrades, the lack of having a solid unit composition to deal with this army Like right now there's nothing that can actually kill Colossus It's going to be Hydras or Lynx and the lurkers don't actually have enough range to even damage these Colossus So these four Colossus by them, what are these links actually doing? Well, not much. Now they're going in for a run I could have done this a lot earlier, I have to say A lot, a lot earlier Or they could have gone home and morphed into binglings Also would have been a useful thing to do a little bit earlier These have just been idling I also wouldn't have minded having links in an army while you're attacking with hydras Sure, they're not great against Colossus, but at least they tank a little bit of damage Not a lot of damage, but at least a little bit It will take like six, seven seconds. And if your opponent is all-inning you off of like, what was it, was 47 workers earlier, then it's probably a good call to just throw everything in the kitchen sink at them Like this type of stuff here, you see the links are actually tanking enough so that the high rusk can get in range That definitely could have happened with those 50 links that were on the top side the entire time or the 45 links or however many it was Because then you just have enough tanking ability all of a sudden This game still is 12 workers I don't know about that one That's really what we need right now? Like we have enough larvas, well We're just not producing stuff. Two more workers, going back up to 89, while Protoss is on pure zealot And 70 workers No Banelings Did you just attack his own creep tumor? We get a prioritization here on the Zerglings once again This has been a, just a very weird game overall I just don't understand it I guess just a missed move command or something The control often in the fight was quite good Okay, it's over Actually lost to mess zealots while having a Baneling Nest and plus two available And having a Lurker Den as well This entire game just made no sense to me. like it almost felt like there were two people playing this game one in charge of the decision making and one in charge of the control like the control at times I was actually quite impressed by it and even some of the like the run bys was quite good you have like not the execution within the runbys on what to attack but just the fact that runbys were happening like the speed here was okayish is just the actual unit composition the fact that we had no no hive lurkers without upgrades, no banlings for the most important fights that were there. Like, don't forget, the exact same comp fought like three times for Protols, and only the final time did it really succeed, because there was literally zero bains in that composition And I guess there were six useless lurkers This game was actually insane, and I could just give my usual spiel, but as I got a poem in the complaint form, Maybe I can make a little poem myself as well Let's try Oh, more girth Oh, more girth I hear you complain But watching you play is giving me pain A void flyby was to be suspected Yet you left your main base unprotected The detees in your third were handled real bad, leaving half of your eco dead. No upgrades for lurkers, no vipers or a hive, quickly brought an end to your life This poem has ended and my favorite Pokemon is Muck Ah, right, I forgot You suck All right, let's go to be it for today's episode of Is It Inba or Do I Suck? If you did enjoy, don't forget the like but subscribe to the channel and hopefully you'll see all of you next time for a new video Thanks so much And bye-bye."

        "text": "Captain, Protops is just easier to play This game I started poorly as I misread the situation and prepared for a proxy, which was not the case Despite, thanks to my opponent's poor macro, the game was even in the midgame I took few favorable fights with my 1-1 timing, which gave me a small lead in army supply and head back home to prepare for the 2-2 push When it hit, my opponent sent a couple of run-bys which dealt massive damage, giving him a lead and killed me a few minutes later For the greater part of the game I was ahead in supply and upgrades, despite the disadvantage in the early game, yet I lost to a couple of run-bys. How is this fair? Few zealots trade very efficient without any control If I would like to do drop, I would have to control them Also, people always say how good Terran's defense is, but it is only if you're staying at home with your whole army Once you're out on the map, you're really vulnerable to attacks Protos has batteries, cannons and recall When my two-two push came, my opponent was able to deflect my whole army with three colossi and a couple of immortals and a battery, while his six zealots killed me at home. I know I could split the army, but what I am trying to say is that if I were Protos, I just recall a part of my army or warpins the Toddluckers to defend It would be easier because this race is easier to play I do believe I played better than my opponent, and it pisses me off even more So, Captain, is it imba, or do I suck? Name Revelation, race, Terran, league diamond, a 3 1K MMR, and his server is Europe. And our good friend Revelation just has the question, is it Inba or do I suck? One of the things that I really appreciated out of Revelation is that every single time he complained about something that Terran was lacking or that he struggled with, He would then mention three random things that Protos has He would say, Terran has poor defense when they're out on the map And then in parentheses, it would say cannons, batteries, recall Like, a very strong argument for Protos not needing to leave any army behind. If you're a Prodos player and you've ever played against Bio in your entire life, you know that if you have, even if you have three cannons and a battery somewhere, that is not going to be doing anything whatsoever. against a straight-up drop attack or like a two medevac or even a single medevac attack if there's any marauders in there three cannons against one medevac might actually be fine that's a lot of resources that you're investing in defending yes recall is a very solid way of pulling a part of your army home but you still need to split your army in that case and yes it is definitely easier than splitting and sending part of your army home but you still need to split something and it has a massive cooldown on that as well You can just use it every single time you're getting dropped. And as the issue here seemed to be, as I recall, multiple zealid run bys, this probably wouldn't even have work for you But we're going to be focusing a lot this game on, oh, it's a fast scout by the way We're going to be focusing a lot this game on the run buys, checking the response time to run bys, because the main complaint really is, hey, this is unfair Like Protos has it so much easier They don't have the micro their drops They don't have to micro their run bys It just deals damage automatically It's just way, way too strong And that's a real issue So Probe Scouts, CC first What is this? Barracks Command center cancel. Now this is a classic, of course This is one that I've seen a lot in the past What did this SUV scout? Let's have a look Let's just have a quick look Okay What is SUV scouted? This SUV scouted, an assimilator, a second assimilator, forgot to check the pylon, or to see if there's anything in the main base, then saw a nexus and a second pylon And the read here was that this was going to be a proxy Now, if you proxy your first gate across the map, Protos always needs a pylon in their main base as well, otherwise you're going to get massively supply blocked. On top of that, it's really difficult to play this type of build order with a proxy, because if you're getting a proxy, usually you also want to get a zealot initially out of the gateway, meaning that the Nexus is going to be delayed So even if you don't scout the pylon and the gateway and the cybernetics core, based on the timing of the Nexus, based on the timing of the second gas, based on the timing of this pylon, you could still figure out that this is just a standard macro build, even if you don't see this, which didn't happen However, Revelation has such poor scouting that I'm honestly kind of worried for him. If this is how he responds to something that is completely normal, I wonder what happens if, let's say, his girlfriend gets a text from a coworker asking to the link of the Google Dog Like, what's he going to do? Break up, burn down the house, move to the North Pole Then two days later, be like, oh, no, actually, asking for the Google Dog was relatively was relatively normal Because don't forget that he tries to talk about this as well He said, this game I started poorly as I misread the situation and prepared for a proxy, which was not the case Imagine this being your excuse after two days You burn out the house and move to the North Pole. And you come back, I'm sorry, I misread this situation I thought you cheated on me, but that was not the case And his girlfriend goes, ah, all good, just make sure it doesn't happen again It's not really how it works This is a very impactful decision that is completely wrong Like everything, even if you believed it was a proxy, this entire response was incorrect Against a proxy from a protos, you don't want to add extra barracks You would want to add a factory for quicker tech You would probably want a bunker on the high ground, so that I do agree with. But adding two barracks, by the time these barracks come into play, like I just want to show everyone how ridiculous this response is Even if his scouting or if what he believed was correct, imagine this was a gateway, single gateway, proxy with two zealots and a stalker The response here was to get, what, two marines, then a reactor, then two barracks None of these barracks would even be functioning yet at this point because he also went for double tech lab before building any extra marines. So at this point, there's two zealots punching his depot wall and there's a stalker on the low ground, and these buildings haven't even contributed anything whatsoever, delaying your command center for no reason, delaying your tech for no reason whatsoever, meaning that any type of follow-up you're going to be doing will be so, so much later This was, the scouting was god-awful, then the response to what you saw was god-awful, but also the response to what you believed you saw was terrible Like, literally everything you did here was incorrect As if you're walking in the desert and you see like an illusion, you know, in the far away from you It's like, oh, there's water there, I'm thirsty. and you should know, first of all, that it's probably an illusion and that you shouldn't be heading there But even if you truly believe it to be an illusion, which in this case you did believe, or you truly believe there to be water there, which in this case you did, then basically what you just did is turn around and start moonwalking away from the illusion where the water is Like every single move in this entire sequence made zero sense whatsoever And you, what did you say one more time? I misread the situation Like, this is not misreading the situation You misread the situation and you responded You did everything incorrect here Like, this game should be completely over at this point. If your response to a standard Nexus timing is to cancel your CC and to build two extra barracks, you don't even belong in diamond yet Like, this is an insane response in my opinion And this should almost disqualify everything else in your entire piece If Terran can have this little theoretical knowledge of the game at diamond level, then I think this debate is settled already and Terran is by far the easiest race to play How is it possible that this type of response is viable at this level? I don't understand that I don't get why that is possible It makes no sense to me whatsoever ProD's built also as balls, by the way I do have to admit it. I'm not a huge fan of the Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Rewind, enhance, solid moves I'm not a huge fan of the Stargate into Fourgate into Twilight Council Twilight Council obviously should be way faster here The tech is going to be way more important The Fourgate makes very little sense The Pro Production has been very poor as well Yet, Terran has less workers, has really crappy production as well I mean, I guess 3-Rex, Starport isn't even that bad Not quite sure why we're seeing Why do we have 500 gas in the bank? And why are we getting a tech lab first on the factory? Surely, if you're investing in triple barracks, the first thing you want is not more tanks. Like, you already have the safety with the barracks What you would want is units to get out on the map, in this case, Menevac So, reactor on the factory here would, in my mind, make a lot of sense But instead, now you need to build the reactor here on the starport, which delays your initial MataVec production by another 36 seconds It got caught out of position a little bit as well there Haven't started an upgrade yet, despite having the money available on top of that I really, really dislike the Protos build, though I will have to say that I think the Protos build here is extremely poor We're floating a lot of energy as well What is this? Supply block for an immortal. I much preferred, much would have preferred seeing an observer here But despite all of this, I still believe Protos is in a superior position Is the first upgrade going to be an armor upgrade? That's very useful if your opponent builds an army consisting of probes only Then the armor upgrade usually really helps, because you're taking less damage from the probes By like, what is it? Probes do five damage, so, you know, then like minus 20% of the damage output However, if your opponent built stalker, zealots or colossi, sentries, immortals, storm, dark Templar, carriers or phoenixes, I think plus one attack is the better upgrade to get first. But in the very rare scenario that you're playing against a probe messing Protos player at diamond level, then this is definitely the correct call So once again, Terran showing very solid theoretical knowledge here of the situation Haskelled the fact that there is a star again Look at this, Oracle That's a lot of energy Did one Oracle die already? No Oh my God This Tos is playing a perfect game The only thing has happened so far is a Oh no Just lost an Oracle as I was talking about the perfect game That actually makes me a bit sad I was very hyped for the perfect game here for the Protos I wonder how long we could have kept that going I love perfect games. Nothing has happened in the past four minutes, which makes sense because What? Oh, we built a Viking as one of our first units? Interesting move I'm not even quite sure how it is possible, but we've managed to move out later than a Terran would have moved out If a Terran would open up with a triple-CC opener and then go into three barracks This was a single-CC opener into triple barracks with a factory into Starport, and the move-out hasn't happened yet eight minutes into the game Hero Marine moves out at like 6 45 if he opens triple-cc into three Like, this timing is so insanely late I don't even quite understand how it is possible. I feel like even if you just do build like random units, you're going to get Medivacs stim and combat shield faster than what Revelation did in this game. Well, Revelation believes there's a purpose behind his build orders as well. Also have 39 workers, eight minutes into the game. Yes, Protoss only has 50, but we're not really looking at the Protoss when it comes that we're looking at Revelation right now. That was a move. That was not a good move. That was not a very good move out of the Protoss whatsoever. I did not like that one. I would prefer if we do not do that in the future. Holy crap Oracle. Ah, Revelation. Nice. Maybe Stasis Ward as well would be really sick. Now, this is a fight that a Terran can't really take near a battery Especially if two of the tanks are attacking the pylon Might want to seat these up, ASAP, there we go Super Battery gets activated This is honestly not that bad of an engagement for the ProDol's I kind of like this engagement defensively here There's only two metaphics, which means that every stim is pretty expensive Super Battery has been used I like the pool back here as well out of Revelation I like the fact that he's setting up a run-by I hope he remembers to do the run-by Often I see people set up a run-by, and then forget about the fact that there is a run-by. but this dukes, ah, no thermal lens Without What is this? This is a very expensive spotter pilot I've never seen this before in my life This isn't even closer to the opponent's base, I think, is it? If you're warping at your third base, that's probably quick, closer to the aggression than this one is Probably you need to put like a ruler on the map or something and it out I think it's going to be pretty close Interesting move Let's ignore it for now Okay Here comes the, a magical drop All right, I think this, this is what we were talking about I just want to read before we watch what's going to happen with this drop. What did he say again about the drop? If I would like to do drop, I would have to control them Now, let's just take a look at the control here of the drop Okay? If I would have to do a drop, I would have to control them That's a good one So far, no control yet on the drop Drop is flying in This is a key moment when it comes to the drop What are we seeing? Four stalkers in position as well as a cannon Okay? Drop needs to be controlled, by the way, for Tarran Drop being controlled? No, not yet No drop being controlled Oh, here we go Boost in and unloads Now, that was control That was control. Lots of control going on here Lots of control And he's really controlling that Did he even stim? Are these units? These units aren't even stint, are they? No stim being used yet No stim being used Okay? Protos Response within what? Nine, ten seconds or so To this drop Not bad Not terrible Not great either It's a fine response time for 10 seconds to respond to a drop Drop doesn't get the pick-off, but you do save the matter-of-fact No micro in this drop whatsoever, okay? So so far to claim that, and also you dealt quite some damage You kill like 10 workers or so. 10 workers, forced units to pull away, forced out a recall, just by a single drop that you didn't control whatsoever That was decent damage for only being there 10 seconds, not even using Stim, one of the most important spells in the entire game Despite all of that, you're in a good position You're getting into better upgrades You have an okay army You have a lot of meta vex I'd prefer some more tanks You are, for some reason, going into eight barracks before 4CC, which makes really no sense You really just can't afford that And you can afford maybe single marine production from these. Sometimes you see eight racks in the TVZ matchup with pure marine production, but I don't think you can quite afford this You don't have enough SUVs You don't have enough income to really afford anything quite like this At least not in my mind You also already are building ghosts which are quite expensive You have two e-base But maybe I'm wrong Maybe you can completely afford it And all of these barracks will be working the entire time Which is unlikely because right now there's only two barracks producing So much rather would have seen a faster ford base But it is what it is Let's not focus too much on that. Once again, we've already established that the theoretical aspect out of Revelation hasn't been brilliant The control so far has been okay of the main army, I think I didn't actually watch to pay too much attention, but no terrible mistakes except attacking the pylon here for a little bit Didn't seem too bad The theoretical aspect, the macro aspect, the build order aspect, map vision when it comes to that No depot over here, no mines being spread out No sensor tower, no blind turrets Oh, here we go As I say, they built turrets These turrets are useless, but I like these turrets I like this turret and I would like a turret over here as well in case of DTs. I think it's generally a good call Single sensor tower would also help a lot There's no marine spread There's no depot spread There's no fort base either with a planetary All of these things definitely would be very, very helpful Now, here we go with the famed two-to timing So if we look at this situation right now from an objective perspective, okay, I will just, I want to kind of get a feel for what the situation is We're in a situation where there's four tanks, 11 marauders, 25 Marines, two ghosts, five Vikings, against three colossus, one immortal, one disruptor, nine cellets. Now, I think if the terran manages to set up in this area, it's going to be close to impossible for the proles to fight this I also believe if the terran attacks either this angle or this angle, that the terran will not be capable of straight up winning because of the batteries, basically, and how the defense usually works for Prolost Like, this is not a terrible situation Ooh, look at that Spots the run by here Oh, this is, oh, these are the famed runbys, I guess Oh, I love this already I'm a huge fan of runbys Okay, here we go Marines and Marauders being sent in here So it cleans up one of these runbys. Basically immediately is also aware of the second runby already Don't forget that These are the six Sallis are going in now At the same time, we're okay, moving into, oh, Protos position in a good spot I don't think Terran can just attack into this, but I could be wrong So I would just like to notice something here is that this was it? Let's just quickly go back into time, a little bit, okay? When did this run by get spotted? Well, we'll write it down mentally I'll write it down in the game One, two, three, four Look at One, two, three, four This gets spotted Okay That is beautiful stuff So at this point, we're back here It's already been a full minute. Don't forget, the Protos took about, what, 10, 12 seconds or so to respond At this point, the Taryn hasn't responded to this yet, whatsoever You could say, well, he's busy with the attack Yes, earlier the Protos, when responding, was busy with the defense as well I often find defending harder than attacking, because when you're attacking, you can at least decide to just go back home and deal with something There are some units just idling over here There are some units idling over here No response whatsoever SEVs not being pulled away either Instead, we're completely focusing on the attack here, which doesn't seem like it can ever really work. Like if you look at the two armies, you should be capable of understanding that you're never going to be capable of beating this army in a super battery, especially not if you're fighting largely without your tanks SELA's still going ham Almost get the orbital command center here It's been a full minute at this point We've seen units being F2 to cross the map SEVs still haven't returned to mining Like, I like that you say if I had recall, I would be capable of dealing with this very well If you had recall, you would have recalled over to your third base and then your units would have F2'd back to your main army. Like, let's stop pretending here that you didn't have units in position There were four units over here, you had two marauders and a marine over here, you had reinforcements coming in as well, you just didn't respond for a full minute so far to six zealids A full minute, you didn't move your stim or your Marines, you didn't even stim them once, and your opponent lost 10 workers Now, you didn't do anything here, and yeah, you lost 20 workers as well, or however many you ended up losing Yeah, probably around 20, 22 workers Like, that is just what happens If you're getting harassed and you don't respond whatsoever, you're going to lose a lot of units You have plenty of units in position. The problem isn't even splitting your army The problem is that the only hotkey that you use to move your army is F2 And that is what's breaking you up here That's what's ruining your life How do these guys even manage to get into this base? It's absolutely beyond me Take out another 15 workers or so In this point, the game is completely over There's nothing you can do anymore This army is going to get cleaned up as well Colossus stand here I just don't understand how you can watch this replay and that your conclusion is that you wish you had recall Like, if I were you, I'd wish that I had someone to tell me to just, the units. You know, like a mental reminder or something like that Wish for a higher IQ, but I wouldn't wish for a recall button It wouldn't have helped You had the units They were in position, you just didn't use them They were literally standing over here, some Marines and a ghost You had like marauders over here as well These are ridiculous It's really not okay Blameying this poor Protos player who's been doing a fantastic job when it comes to responding You can say a lot about this toss I don't like the build order Don't like some of the fights he took like some of the decisions, but the response time has been really on point. Maybe Revelation has the mini map covered at all times to improve his auditory senses, you know? That is a real possibility I like this multitasking I think it's quite good Once again, no response, of course Even with recall, like there's units in position practically You're just waiting 20 Look, they're just walking by Why are we pretending that the Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay Now you might think that these marauders and marines responded to the zealot run by, but what happened here is he used F2 and stimmed his entire army and then pressed A move And because the most close by threat were these zealots, these marauders are moving in. You can see it because they're stutter stepping forward to try and kill these colossus He accidentally cleared this zealot run by Don't get tricked here This was not on purpose Recall would have done absolutely nothing here Yongcho with a well-deserved win It would be easier because this race is easier to play I could split the army, but what I am trying to say is that if I were pro-lost, I just recall a part of my army This is the line that pisses me off the most in this entire thing. It makes no sense whatsoever because we've seen time after time after time again that even if you would have infinite recalls, even if your units would have teleport with no cool down whatsoever, just like the battle cruisers have, except they have a cool down, of course What would happen is you would recall back home or you would teleport back home, then you would A-move with your main army and accidentally clear up the run by Like there seems to be absolutely no idea on how to split your army whatsoever, how to use different groups of units in any normal way Protos is, okay, maybe in some ways Protos is easier This game, I haven't seen any of that whatsoever. If you're going to make that claim, you're going to need way, way better evidence than this, my friend This wasn't it? This was just you sucking And that's the truth All right That's going to be it for me today Thanks all so much for watching I hope you didn't enjoy this episode of IOTIS If you did not forget, IOTS, if you did not forget, you can submit your own IOTIS complaint form using the Google Docs link below That will be it for me and bye-bye Thank you."

        "text": "Dear Mr Harston, I have been severely violated by a fellow countryman of yours As I'm ending up on YouTube losing to a Terran anyway, embarrassing, I figured I might as well send it to you as well See, I faced a 5 6k Terran thinking, this will be easy My pvt is 64% win rate But nothing could have prepared me for the endless stream of pure horror that would be coming my way I scouted double gas into factory and react accordingly I then see that he is going for mass cyclone and widow mine. Now, while I have never played against this in my life, I figured mass stalker and two-time Robo Disruptor would easily deal with this, but he hit me so early and everything died Widow mines were all over my natural and killed the disruptors as they popped That's when I realized, dot, dot, dot This is Utermal doing his YouTube series, which he confirmed to me I believe this comp is unfair, And the only reason it's not used in ProPlay is because it would be nerved instantly Cyclops alone Now, I assume that the submitter means cyclones here, because I've never seen the unit Cyclops before in StarCraft 2 Anyway, Cyclops alone, I can deal with But Widowinds counter everything anti-cyclone. I am saddened at the MMR I lost because if he played a real match, I would have easily rolled him up and smoked him like a camel my PVT is 64% So harsed them, what could I possibly have done to beat this when everything loses to it? I admit I could have kept better track of my observers and accidentally build a colossus, but other than that, I believe I reacted fairly correctly Answer me, Captain, do I suck? Or is Terran completely broken? So Emil versus Eutermal it is. And this is Euterremo doing one of his YouTube series, where he does one type of build order or one type of unit style, and then he starts in bronze, I believe, and then he takes it all the way to Grandmaster, similar to what Beastie Cutie used to do a lot of in the past And Emil was the victim of this Doesn't quite know how to beat it, despite his 64% win rate, by the way, case you guys weren't paying attention I feel like Emmo is that one friend that once got like a 7 out of 10 on his English test. And ever since that point, whenever there's like a movie you're watching in English or whatever, He goes like, Hey, guys, my English is pretty good I once got a 7 out of 10 Like, yeah, whatever, Gary, no one cares about your English Let me watch my movie in peace That's what I feel like Emil was doing here as well Kind of similar vibes there He mentioned it twice, the 64% win rate It's also not really that impressive That's the thing It was like 85% win rate I'd be like, oh, that's actually really high 85 64 is like, it is slightly better than normal So, I don't know I wouldn't be I wouldn't be so proud of it. At least, yeah, I don't think I would be so proud of it It seems like a very weird thing as well, especially because the win rate percentage is not like an absolute number You know, it's not like MMR, where you can be proud I've got 7K MMR or I got 5K MMR That's pretty big But 60, like, there are bronze players that might have 64% win rate in PVT, but then they have 20% winning rate in ZVP, and they could brag about the same thing It's just an overall, there's a really, a really odd thing to brag about, now that I think about it It just doesn't make a lot of sense, the win rate in an individual matchup. Unless you play at the absolute highest level, because then it actually does show that you're probably one of the best in that matchup overall in the world This is interesting Just a standard core into Nexus opener This is what it looks like to me The scout is going away Didn't quite confirm what the first unit is You can usually see whether it's a Marine or a Reaper first, didn't went in to confirm this Ooh, Mr 64 win rate Look at this Now, this is a cybernetics core that finished at, I think it was 204 Okay? The adept started a second and a half after the core finished That's bad Don't get me wrong. But the core being four seconds too late at 5K MMR, that is actually pretty bad, especially if you're consistently bragging about how good you are in PvT Yet one of the most basic things, which is actually getting your Cybernetics Core in time, doesn't go right This is really important because there are two main build orders in this matchup One of them being Nexus before Core, which delays your Core by about nine seconds, and one being Core before Nexus, which delays your Nexus by about nine seconds, because you switch the order of the buildings That's how the game works In this case, we get a new build order We get the Core into Nexus, but the Core delayed by five seconds. for no reason whatsoever, so your adept is still later Now, what does this do for the Protos? It might accidentally trick your opponent into thinking that you have more money than you actually do have, because they believe you went Nexus before Core This is just a bad build, and especially for someone bragging so much about the fact that this PVT is fantastic, it's quite frankly a little bit embarrassing But let's continue watching here and let's not judge too hard quite yet It seems like a Robo or Twilight Yep, Twilight Council is going to be constructed here 235 is kind of laid a bit low on the gas mining, perhaps Not a huge fan so far of anything that's been happening yet. And a second chrono on a gateway unit, which makes some sense given the fact that Emil scouted that there was a fast factory coming down I was going to send this back in I really like that move as well, actually I love this probe just going in and wanting to know what's happening It's going to figure out that there is a cyclone This is a huge, huge, huge style You can So if you open like this against a two gas opener, Taryn cuts a massive amount of economy, like four, maybe five SUVs even get cut out of this build compared to a standard one gas expansion, and they get way faster factory units for that. This can be annoying for TOS because you don't have any scouting information, so you don't know what to respond to But right now you see your opponent is probably building one of the worst terran units in the world, the cyclone, and he's doing it at a very high pace, cutting some of his eco that makes sense given the challenge that Utherm was going for, but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense in a standard game This is a massive advantage right now here for Emu if he had actually produced a second gateway yet, which for whatever reason isn't quite here as of this moment I'm not entirely sure why we don't have one quite yet. One of the main things in StarCraft 2, and especially for a PVT expert like Emil with 64% win rate, would be to have at least one extra gateway finish the moment Warpgate finishes up The moment it finishes up The Warpgate research, that is However, what we're doing here is this was about 92 seconds in these two gateways go down So that means they're basically 40 seconds late This is fairly embarrassing, in my opinion Like, it's just There is no real point to having these gateways be 40 seconds Like, the third one, you can't quite afford, but the second one needs to be there in order to provide for good unit production You need more units usually early on And these are. The thing is, is that I'm not even sure if these are decisions, or if they're just sloppy So my man has been bragging this entire time about being very good about it And then when push comes to shove, he pulls this type of crap It's as if someone is bragging about being really good at football, then you pass him to football He trips over the ball and poops himself on the way down as he falls to the grass It's like he loses pretty much all credibility to in the future kind of claim himself to be a football master It's like, you remember, you know, I'm a football master I remember all the members you pooping yourself and tripping over a ball ball. It just doesn't quite have the same ring to it as a football master And it feels like it's the same here with Emil He just, he's like this self-proclaimed PVT guru And all he does is build buildings too late And also kind of in a nonsensical, what is this actually? Like this is a three gate blink without a prism So then what is the point of the three gate? You can't really reinforce this push There's not even a proxy pylon It seems like he just thinks that having three gates is a nice amount And now there's a forge before a Nexus This is absolutely not a build order. Like, the fact that this can give you a 64% win rate says more about this MMR than it says about your actual skill in PVT Because these build orders are just not good You can't, okay, this is actually insane Just everything is late Just every single building that Emuel is building here is way too late It started with the core, then the gateways, now the Robo Bay If you're playing a two-base Colossus build, for the love of God, make sure that your robo base starts before 440 or 445, you can't start it at the, what is this, 510, 508? Like, that's just 30 seconds too late. And why are you starting such a fast robot bay against pure cyclone? I'm not so sure if that is useful One of the good things you can do against cyclones is just getting a lot of stalkers out High microability makes it difficult Makes it difficult for the cyclones to actually chase you if you have a lot of smaller units Because a cyclone can only attack one unit at the time And cyclones, you know, you don't build them so fast You have two factories They're relatively expensive You can just outmash your opponent with mass stalker, basically, and then much slower transition into those higher tech units. If you get six stalkers and two colossus and your opponent has eight cyclones, he's going to be pretty happy If you have 16 stalkers, he's going to be a lot less happy because it's way harder to micro against it as the cyclone player So if you figure out that your opponent is messing cyclones, it's probably better to initially stay on a higher stalker count and then later on transition into disruptor I love by the way that he mentioned, that he built an accidental colossus That's what he said, right? And accidentally build a colossus I love that he said accidentally build a colossus, but then also is getting thermal lens So this shows there is some premeditation here you know. This wouldn't fly in a court case You know, I judge, I swear I wasn't planning on killing her Why do you have plans of her house? Why did you bring a gun to the dinner? Like there's so many questions here that I have It feels like you wanted to build Colossi and then afterwards realized that Colossi weren't the answer and then in the form you pretend that you already had figured that out This is some high level of pretending here, my friend And I'm not buying it I am absolutely not buying it It is the same as the people that pretend to enjoy jazz I'm not buying it No one likes jazz. It is something that people do to pretend that they have elite taste That's an interesting blink For someone with a 64% wind rate I can't want to see that one again I feel like this situation would have been okay had you not blinked in Now, I want to explain something about how the cyclone actually functions. okay the cyclone has a least range uh or just like an overall range has a least range and overall range the moment you move out of the range of the cyclone the the thing that he has the line to you it breaks which makes blink a fantastic spell to have on cool down because you can blink out of either vision range or out of the range where the cyclone can chase you and because cyclones are difficult to micro individually and stalkers a lot easier the micro stalker again cyclone usually is quite good for the ProDos The one thing that completely destroys this entirely is if you blink in to the cyclone for no reason whatsoever. I'm not quite sure why you would do that And you do hit a disruptor shot on one of the cyclones Then why are you, I feel like it would have been better to just not have blink then if this is how you're going to use it You're just making it easier for the cyclones to absolutely destroy you Oh, oh, oh, oh my God, that was so close Could have gotten three mines there I mean, at this point I feel like the game is fairly over already Even before the first Colossus is out Finally enough, this Colossus actually is helping you, which pisses me off Eh, does it help you? Yeah, I'm 50-50 I'm not sure of helping. This, I don't think it can really be described as helping Your thermal moves back with these five cyclones And you pretty much Yeah, well, at this point you're pretty much dead, right? There's a couple of mines in your natural steel Good retarget, there we go Hey, Uttarmo's a very good player It's like 6, 4, 6 5 MMR in your 5K So this type of stuff, like these small interactions, is where you're just kind of going to get blasted, obviously But yeah, this is just really, really Nothing you've done so far has made a lot of sense to me When it comes to the build order, the early start, the actual response as well. I really believe that a higher stock account would have been much better than whatever abomination it is of a show that you put on here But at the same time, we also need to note that it is a little bit unfair, of course And don't forget that, imagine if I were a boxer, okay, and I were to go box against Mike Tyson in his prime And I'm an amateur boxer I've done a little bit I have a coach with me as well And I get in the ring and Mike Tyson just pimpsleps me around for like six or seven or eight times And I get knocked out. And I ask my coach, it's like, hey, coach, what am I supposed to do against the pimps lap? I've never had this pimps lap being done to me before in practice And then my coach says, well, it doesn't really matter what he says It's because the real reason why I can't fight the pimps lap is because I'm lacking in power I'm not strong enough Like I might be a decent amateur boxer and I can beat up, you know, the guys that scream nasty things at me when I walk to the supermarket But Mike Tyson is different It's the same here Uthermal just has way more strength He has more power He has very good macro He has very good micro. He has his control, his decision making All of that is just way better than yours So even if you would have had the perfect responses here, I'm still completely expecting you to lose just that if I were to fight Mike Tyson in my prime and he would Pimp Slapp me, I would think I would go K-O, despite the PIMSlapp not being a very viable move in professional boxing And that is pretty much the same thing that's happening over here There's not much again Yes, you've made a lot of mistakes so far, but it's also you're just playing against someone that is so much better than you that even if you wouldn't have made these mistakes, you would have lost in the end. There's no real winning for you in a way way So I can only really say is that you're not good enough yet You don't have the power level, you know If Eskatcham, after getting his Pikachu walks into the Pokemon League, he's going to get absolutely stomp And no matter how much you'll advise him on picking the correct move for his Pikachu, you know, maybe you shouldn't start with tail whip and go with tackle first, you know, that might be good advice But it wouldn't get Ascatchez him to take out a level 85 Charizard And that is what happened here So I'll do two things here First of all, you suck and you should stop mentioning that you have a 64% win rate. This is a fact, okay? Like it doesn't make any sense, the 64% We cut it out, okay? It's not in our vocabulary anymore You also sucked Your build order from start to finish Everything was too late You need to look at a build order that makes some sense here with a faster second gateway so you can have way more production early on I did like your scouting early on I thought that was good But the lack of your second gateway, your overall lack of units, your RoboBeta is too late, your third base that gets delayed for no reason as well, your forge before secondary tech? Oh, yo, yo, that had the alarm bells ringing for me. Forge before a Robo Bay, forged before third base These are not things that you do in PVTs These are absolute no-noes because you don't need upgrades that much You need more money or you need faster tech One of these two things is the most important So yes, my friend, you do suck But at the same time, even if you didn't suck, you would have lost as well And it's not because it's in balance Well, I guess Uthermal is a little bit imbalance in this case, because it's just a lot better than you So we'll call this a toss-up, a 50-50 All right That's going to be it for me today Thanks all so much for watching.

        "text": "Dear Harstam, can you legit tell me how I lost this? My army value is superior, my work account is higher, I have carriers and storms, and he wins with Hydras? If he had beat me with Corruptor, Viper, Lurker or Ultra, fine, but pure Hydras? And people think this game isn't broken? I started off doing the Gateway Man build hero uses It opened Stargate into ground units The plan was Okay The Gateway Man build hero users It's very specific of a thing And saying it opens Stargate into ground units to cover what the Gateway Man hero does It's like saying I made Gordon Ramsey's chocolate cake because I put some flour and chocolate in a bowl and then I tossed it in the microwave. Yes, technically some of the ingredients that are in Gordon Ramsey's chocolate chocolate cake are in the ball in your microwave, but it isn't exactly the same thing Like the Gateway Man that Hero uses, when we talk about that, usually it's low gas, it has multiple forges and a high eco with a very fast Ford base, saying that it opens Stargate into ground units is something that scares me, because that is not what the Gateway Man built that Hero uses is at all But we'll let it rest for now. The plan was to go ground units, but then I saw he was not droning his third, so I tacked into carriers and high Templars since my ground army wouldn't beat a Mas Hydra Roach army, but Mas Hydra have such high DPS, interceptors don't stand the chance There is no time to let interceptors recharge, my base will die, and then it's still game over I can indeed say my comp counters Hydras, so I should win That's how the game is supposed to work The Zerk having 2-2 on ground against plus 1 attack carriers shouldn't matter much He's on cheap Tier 2 units, so strong tier 3 units like carriers and High Templar should win anyway. For the amount of money and time carriers cost to make, the idea that 2-2-Hydras beat plus 1 carriers with High Templar support is beyond stupid. If that's the case, the game is indeed broken. It's practically impossible to get 3-3 carriers unless you started out going for Skytoss from the start of the game that is no longer viable after the Void Ray patch. I honestly don't get it. I can't see how this is anything other than broken. I made less mistakes than my opponent. Are Hydras Imba? Or do I suck? Name, table, race, Protoss in the Diamond League with 3,500 MMR and the server is North America. And the question is pretty simple. Are Hyndras imbalance? Or does he suck? And we're here to find out All right, here we are in the game on Inside and Out between Table I love that nickname, by the way It's a very good nickname And Bill, which is probably just Bill's actual name Our friendly neighborhood Zirk opening up with a, I think this was a 16 pool Well, we have a post-gateway scout coming out of table Now, there was one thing in the balance complaint form that actually still pissed me off a little bit Just when I think back, although there were many things that pissed me off a little bit But it was a line that I've kind of went over that I didn't really manage. but I do want to talk about it And that is when Table said that the moment he scouted very little drones at the third base, he decided to attack into High Templar and Carrier Now, that is a response that makes no sense whatsoever And he put it in there like this was a common way to deal with Allens So if there are no drones at a third base, this means that most likely there's a quick attack coming in your way How is the response to a quick attack trying to tack into the unit that takes the longest to produce out of the entire Protos arsenal? Not counting the mothership The carrier The carrier takes freaking what is it, 65 seconds to build. You need a fleet beacon before it as well How is that a reasonable response to someone two base all in you? That's like saying, oh, I need to be somewhere in 10 minutes from now and, you know, if I drive by car I'll make it in 8 you decide to crawl instead It just doesn't make a whole lot of sense The response, I like that he managed to make the analysis that, hey, very little drones at the third base probably means something is happening and I need to react to it But then the actual response makes no sense and I can't even really find a justification in my head for it either. And honestly, he says carriers and high templars in the balanced complaint form High Templars also make no sense because High Templars take a while first you need the Templar archives, you need to research storm is all extremely expensive and you also need to gather energy So you need to invest a lot of resources and a lot of time before Templar actually have any defensive benefit whatsoever Units that are good against Quicallin are things like sentries, batteries and cannons, immortals, high damage outputs, they can take a bit of a hit as well, very good defensively. In combination with sentries and static defense, that is a type of unit you want to be building, maybe even throw out a void ray if you are opening Stargate like we're seeing here This is one hell of an opener, by the way, double zealot with a battery as well That's because this was a pool first And my good friend Table has never watched my guide on how to beat every single pool first And as he comes up with a response himself, which is obviously subpar, but he did not manage to die Well, I mean, it would be fairly difficult to die against two links that got built from the pool first But he's in an okay spot. Bill is also playing a build that is not a build If Lombo would see this, he'd probably have a heart attack immediately or he starts shaking at a very high pace because he's getting very upset by this This is a two-based roach build I would not recommend this If you're a Zirk player and you're watching, low Queen Count, low drone count Roaches suck at attacking Roaches kind of suck in general Yeah, this is just not very good Third base of the Zerk is at the exact same time here is the third base of the Protos So the Protos naturally is going to be a hat Protos, by the way, hadn't scouted that there was no third base. So it just kind of blindly took a third base Could have been getting NIDIS All-L-LIN No Vision in the main base Could have been getting, well, actually just Nidus All-In It's not like there's too many two-base all-ins Two-base Nidus Swarmhose, maybe, which is technically a semi-macro build, but also not really, it's also kind of all-in So, yeah, I can't really think of anything Zirkan do on two-base like a two-based Hydra Ling Al-Lin, would technically be possible, but not very popular, also just not very good All right, let's take a look at this Gateway Man that our good friend Table spoke about Let's have a look at this. Well, first of all, we're lacking probes, which is bad, continuously not building probes, is a mistake with a build that is focused on high economy, high production, like lots of infrastructure, and quick expanding all over the map, while at the same time trying to deny your opponent's fifth base and harassing drones on the third and fourth base and maybe even getting a prism in towards the main Don't forget that when you're playing Heroes Gateway Man style, often you want to be playing it with two forges as well, because you're relying on such basic and primitive units And you know what the beauty is of basic and primitive units with good upgrades is that they actually can perform well against higher tier units. This is something that is interesting to note It's something that Table also noted in his balance complaint form and something that he complained about the Hydra being a Tier 2 unit with good upgrades being capable of taking out the carrier So just keep that in the back of your head for now So here we get the scout I think this is the scout that gets talked about, right? Little drones, or in this case no drones at the third base, it's going to scout the other I actually really like this You know, this is actual good scouting I'm fairly impressed by this I'm going to pause here for a second and just kind of explain what we saw here. And especially for diamond level, I think this was really cool Oracle flies in, sees the lack of any drones on the third base, realizes that something is up, flies over towards this location to make sure there's no base over there with drones, which I think is a fantastic call What if the fourth base is the one being saturated? I mean, it is not the highest level People do weird things all the time Sees that there is no fort base, flies into the main, throws out a revelation, and rather than trying to kill half a drone or fight with the queen, just flies away I really, really like this entire sequence out of this Oracle The scouting is absolutely flawless here Very good cause. And something you don't honestly see that much at this specific level, 3,500 MMR in America I don't think this is supposed to happen Now, the response here What was said again? Right, it was said that the moment scouted the lack of drones on the third, you wanted to attack into Templar and Fleet Beacon This got scouted at about the six minute mark Let's see if we can figure out when that carrier-templar transition finishes up I do like the double cannons here, actually I think this is somewhat okay I'm not sure where this gas isn't being saturated Okay, here comes the Templar Archives Huge fan of this This also makes no sense, by the way. Like, the entire transition of Templar Archives at this point makes no sense because you're playing a low gas build order Like, you're playing off of currently two gases while you're taking a fort and a fifth gas and not having a third saturated And then you're pretending like you can actually tag into Storm or Aracons Like, you have 900 minerals in the bank and 74 gas By the time you have enough gas for a Templar, your opponent will be on five bases with 95 drones. Like, you just simply don't have the resources to get Templar with Stormout right now while also trying to, you know, get some other things, like the necessary sentries, which in my mind, you probably want to get one or two at this point It probably would be useful against someone that is I'm actually not quite sure what this is either. This build, to me, doesn't make a lot of sense, because this is a low drone, late third base, double evo build so I can understand being confused by this seeing all the information being confused but the thing is stable wasn't confused he was fairly certain of what was happening here right he said oh yeah I think I'm being a lynned well he didn't say he was being a land he said there was little drones on the third base response to that was carriers and and storm so he scouted it at six minutes don't forget start storm at seven minutes and 40 seconds So that is about a minute and 40 seconds later. Then storm starts and that will take, well, without Corona boost, about 80 seconds So if this all-in were to hit anywhere within the next two minutes after being scouted, the response to the all-in would not have been ready to the all-in So it's not a good response then because most all-ins, if you manage to scout them, will hit within the next 15, 20 to 30 seconds your opponent has given you or is giving you three times as much time or four times as much time than you ever really should be getting Like this is not a fair response to an all in. Also, my initial suspicions of you not understanding what the hero gatewayman build is have been confirmed this is not the hero gateway man This is just standard zealot stalker storm, which people have been playing for 12 years or 13 years It is just a rush into Templars to get Storm out because Storm beats basically everything the Zerk has that isn't a lurker, an ultra or a brute lord Like, this is something that people do They pretend like they're playing something that they aren't This is not the hero build It is not close to the hero build It doesn't resemble the hero build The only thing that you and the hero build have in common is that you build a Stargate and some gate. and some gateway units That is it It's not, this is no second fort There's no aggression There has been literally no run bys, no nothing As I say that, of course a runby gets sent out Actually, can't believe this crap Oh, no, it's not a runby It's the entire army moving towards the left side Then there's Ling run by and then you'll F2 back home Or you lose the fort base Two options here Or a warped There's actually the correct response I said nothing That was not table I was being too negative there And I apologize for that That was uncalled for Nice and sincere apologies Take a look at this fight Roaches and Hydro is in position All right, all right. A move into this army Solid decision making there Let's just assess the situation once more here Like just, just while we, you know, while we attack, let's, let's see if there's any clue as to how this fight would go Now, what are the things we usually look at? that Army size, army composition, upgrades Upgrades were down Army size, we're down Composition, well, we have zealots going to be fighting into Roach Hydra without any splash, without any immortals, without any zone control, or did you call that zone control, force fields, like a map control, I guess, without the ability to easily cut off parts of the army So at this point, that should be, well, abundantly clear in my mind Absolutely abundantly clear. But it is not the table Table moves in, loses all of his zealads, and it says, you know what, now that I've lost all my zealads, might be a good time to retreat, and decides to just shift click back home Luckily for Table, he already has the one Templar Ooh, look at that Is that the first one we have? Yeah, first Templar So at, well, he had Storm a little bit earlier Let's say at the nine minute mark, there was one Templar with Storm Great response to the All-In that should have hit at like the six minute mark Fantastic stuff Three minutes late. When it comes to the carrier transition, which was a response to the low drone count, let's not forget about that We finally finished our fleet beacon So that is four minutes after the initial scout of the All-In, the response is started We're halfway through our response to the All-In right now Halfway Fantastic stuff Absolutely brilliant This is what I live for What was the noise? Oh, there was a stasis word, I think That's very loud in my ear No map vision, by the way, except for this one salad here on the right side Nothing here, nothing here, nothing here, nothing at the rocks Every single way of being attacked is not being scouted right now by table So everything is a surprise Everything. Literally every little thing would be surprising to table right now Links coming from this angle Oh, a surprise The entire army being here Ten lurkers popping in between your natural third and fourth base Massive surprise Like, it's great to be easily surprised if people are hosting a surprise party for you, but it's not so great if you're playing a competitive game of StarCraft 2, my friend You need information in order to win Oh, what the army? Where did that come from? I wish I had tools to figure it out, like putting a zealot on the map But no, that would be possible Loses 20 zealots before the fight starts Then storms the entire army, which is the correct call. My tone of the voice made it sound like that was incorrect But storming was actually very good, and I like that as well And then destroys the army If you were to look at this fight, okay, and just analyze it from start to finish, I don't think it's possible to come to the conclusion that the Hydra was too strong here Literally, Protos lost half their army for free, then threw down four spells, and killed every single Hydra inside Then all there was level was roaches, and the carriers and zealot clean that up as well And all of that, despite the Zerk being up in upgrades So I look at that fight and I think to myself, yeah, seems pretty fine. I built a tier three unit I invested a lot of gas and time and resources into the Templar and this all paid off so far I think you can pretty much say that this composition works against the opponent's composition Now, of course there are some caveats The moment you're playing against someone with better upgrades than you, your units will perform worse And you can say, yeah, but my thing is supposed to beat his And the composition, yes, composition is very important, but upgrades also are very important Imagine you're fighting someone, imagine you're fighting someone, and he has a sword and you have a shield. Now, whenever he tries to hit you with his sword, you might want to put your shield in front of your face or your body to protect it, because, you know, otherwise you get killed And that's not very nice Now, if your shield is made of twigs and branches and plants, despite the correct response to a sword usually being putting the shield in front, with this particular shield, it is so weak that the sword might just be capable of getting through it and actually damaging you So despite you having the correct counter to your opponent's weapon, it doesn't necessarily mean that you're also going to be winning the fight And that's going to be the same with carriers. If your opponent is on 3-3 with Hydra and a couple of roaches in there for some ground unit tanking, and your carriers have plus one, yeah, the fight is just going to be difficult because your opponent just has way more power Like that is also kind of a, this is one of the lines you use, no? That's how the game is supposed to work For the amount of money and time carriers cost to make, the idea that 2-2-hydras beat plus-1 carriers with high-templar support is beyond stupid If that's the case, the game is indeed broken First of all, I'd argue that so far it kind of has been shown that carriers with high-templar support perform very, very well against hydras. But even if it were the case that these hydras splits are a bit better and there's 3-3 upgrades, and then the plus-1 carriers lose, I don't think that would mean that the game is broken It just shows that there are multiple areas in the game where it can be ahead and behind it I think that's a very healthy thing for a game If the moment someone gets a certain unit out completely hard counters the opponent's composition, it just isn't as interesting anymore You're just hard countering each other's composition There needs to be very many variables in the game for it to have interesting fights And that is the case in StarCraft too I think that is a good thing. I don't think that's a bad thing And I definitely do not believe that that makes the game broken whatsoever Okay, now next fight, we have nine carriers, eight High Templar and 39 hydras We hit one storm Let's see a bit of a moveback A couple extra interceptors going to be taken out here A couple of extra storms, two more storms hitting One on the hydras, one on the roaches Seems like a pretty decent fight to me I think this looks very, very good here for the Protoss, honestly That's not the greatest storm, but it shouldn't really matter either Yeah, pretty much pushes this back Kills like about 30 hydras, loses nothing. but this is yeah needs a storm again like the storm support is a pretty important part of the carrier High Templar army because carriers by themselves especially this poorly upgraded wouldn't perform insanely well against hydras right and here what you want to be doing is rather than sending in five interceptors at a time when they're being rebuilt is just leave the carriers back for a bit You are up in some zealids as like cannon fodder and you use the Templar to kind of zone out some of these hydras That is a very important thing to do because that way you can rebuild the interceptors. If you're just going in every single time with three or four interceptors, yeah, you're never going to be building up a superior interceptor count Move command Missing a storm, missing another storm More interceptors just being given away for free Storm, storm, storm, storm Storm, storm? Storm, storm Hello, I know we have storms I find it very difficult to believe that none of these storms are hitting Don't we have any storms that? Oh, they just morph all of his Templar into Archons? That's not a good call And now there's only five in a This is the worst way to lose, by the way Like legit there I'm not even sure if it's over yet How many gateways do we have? 11. Big Salad warp in Move the carriers back so he don't lose them Like, I look at this fight and I think to myself, yes, 2-2-hydras beat interceptors How do win with hydras? Well, the hydras are 2-2 Oh, it's over Very nice The hydras are 2-2 The Protos has two cybernetics scores Okay, it has plus 2 at this point as well, with no more interceptors And went pure carrier without using the Templar most important part of the fight So when there was a lot of hydras and they're, you know, they killed all the ground units Now they're just fighting pure interceptors At this point, you want to storm for two major reasons. The first reason is that hydras have very low HP and if a storm actually hits, it will kill them very quickly and then the interceptors can kind of come after The way you want to do it is you want to use your storms to zone out the hydras and then you want to use your interceptors to kind of clear them up in a way You don't want to first lose all your interceptors because then the micro against the storm will be easier Another reason why you want a storm is because it forces the Hydra player to not fight with your units or lose them basically He'll need to lose DPS to micro away from the storm or the hydras will simply just die. So that's why you always just want to be kind of occasionally be throwing a storm here and there, not seven at the same time, but one and then another one and you want it It's important that they hit the hydras as well I saw four or five storms there that either hit like half a roach or two hydras or they just hit, you know, a poor critter that was accidentally walking by It was just mining his own business in the wild He's a fight Like, oh, that looks interesting A storm on his face I'm not actually sure a storm kills critters now that I think about it Probably does. Yeah, you just lost all of your interceptors here without using any of the storms All the other fights where you had storms and carriers together, you pretty much won Even the start of the final fight went very well Your opponent had to rebuild 26 hydras at once Well, you basically lost like what, maybe six or maybe eight supply or something like this All the fights were really good You just had one extremely bad fight and then you died And this also was against an opponent that was extremely all in with a very high army supply You could have built cannons against this, could have built more batteries. You could have maybe done a little bit of a zealot run by while this was happening to force some of the units back There's a lot, or to stop the reinforcements from instantly going to the main army There were a lot of things you could have done But I don't think that this really proves that hydras are the hard counter to Templar carrier Not at all Like, the Zerk player trades extremely poorly for a very long time until you completely throw a fight And then you're like, oh, hydras are too strong when you didn't storm whatsoever Like, you can't say that Templar carrier isn't good enough if you don't use use your Templar correctly and you don't use your carriers correctly. That has nothing to do with the unit and has everything to do with you On top of that, you had no map vision, had no harassment, no static defense whatsoever, and your upgrades were slow All of that together, you suck And that's just the way it is All right, my friends, that's going to be it for today's episode of Is It Inba? Or do I suck? If you did enjoy this one, don't forget to the like button, subscribe to the channel and hopefully I'll see all of you next time for a new video here on the Harsham channel Bye-bye."

        "text": "Dear Harstam, Terran is Imba I know you don't believe it, but trust me, after watching this replay, you will agree with me My opponent is quite strong Komoji Satori, aka Gu Ming Di Zhu in Chinese, ranked second in China's ladder In this game, I kept my worker from exploding by his win-on-mine airdrop, and I defended two waves of attack That's a heavy loss of my eco, but my dark templars overturned the situation, and I deployed a bunch of BG units in his base Now, BG units for the people that aren't aware, is units that are built from the gateway B is the hotkey for build and G is the hotkey for gateway. And Chinese players often describe buildings or units with the hotkeys through which they are built All right, a bit of background info Let's continue I think I had a better resource advantage, so I attacked his third base, pushing with six colossus us, I know two colossus can't evaporate marines quickly That's a 200 pop push, and at that time, Gu only got 150 pop In the end, all of my colossus were destroyed, and I lost I think the Colossus is suck in battle Name is JV here The race is Protos and the Master League on the Chinese server His opponent is the famous Gu, the rank two on the Chinese server. I never heard of him, but if he's ranked two, it's got to be pretty good And the question here is, is Terran imbalanced or does he suck? And a specific request here to have a closer look at the Colossus So that's what we're going to do All right, so here we go JV in the top right against GOO, our orange Taryn in the bottom left On inside and out, a really cute map, and you see a probe heading over towards the bottom side Curse to see how well these players do Now, JV mentioned that Gou is the second ranked player on the two Chinese server I don't actually know what that means. As in, I don't know what the skill level of the second ranked player in the Chinese server actually is Is that a good player? Is that a bad player? It is completely possible that all of the top players from China play on different servers, like on the more competitive servers, either Europe or Korea I know a lot of Chinese players have been playing some of the European Cups as well I've been performing kind of okay I know a lot of the Chinese players enjoy playing on Korea as well, people like Time, Sai, and I think coffee plays on Korea Coffee also plays on Europe. So there's a bunch of people there that obviously are very good, but I'm not sure if they play on the Chinese server So it's completely possible that Gu over here would be like a mid-masters or a high-masters on another server, but it's actually ranked second on the Chinese server I'm just, I just don't know I have no clue what the actual skill level is what I'm trying to say Now, we see a lot of mineral mining going down here and a slow rally into the assimilator That means that we're not going to be seeing a stargate most likely. The moment you see maximum mineral saturation, 99% of the time, it's just either going to be a Twilight Council, some type of three gate pressure, or even in some cases even a robotics facility opener God Just thinking about robotics facility. openers kind of makes me shiver a little bit scares me it's a scary thought we do have a semi wall here well actually well no this is an actual semi wall um i was gonna say this is a semi wall because it doesn't wall out this area but i don't even think this wall's out this area either because i do believe there's i think this is a hole it feels like you this is a hole that needs to be plugged by an adept i don't know like i don't think you can't even put a pylon up here Hey guys, Hamster here with a quick intermission to check that claim because it appears to be a full wall. I cannot get my probe through that at all And this seems to be because this little knob right here is actually unbuildable terrain You can see the little X icon And that's why this is still a full wall, even though it looks very deceiving Here it is once again with a fully built cybercore You can see it's not possible to get anything through there So I guess that means harshdom actually sucks at Walling Back to you, Kevin Two pilots maybe Or like a stalker you can put in there That really sucks I love the thought of Walling here, though I'm a huge fan of that I really am a huge fan of that. Because it only allows the Reaper to jump in through this spot It makes it easier to deny basically anything, any type of scouting, any type of harassment as well This is kind of interesting Why is this so late? What? Okay, I'm actually fairly confused, but I need to see this again What is this crap? Okay I was so mesmerized here by the wall I didn't quite see what was going on So we have the cybernetics core finishing at 204 That's already four seconds late for a core first, which is relatively slow Then we start off with an adapt warp gate and only then do we start the battery, not even instantly a probe cut as well. Holy crap, this is a terrible execution here Yeah, so this battery, it starts 14 seconds later than it usually starts with this type of play, or maybe 12 seconds later than it usually starts Because what you want to be doing, if you get a battery in your main base, so that you can get your adapt across the map as quickly as possible without having to worry about losing any workers to a potential Reaper It's a cool play that a lot of the Korean Protos players used to love like, let's say, eight, nine months ago Nowadays is not quite as popular anymore But when they did it, they would always have the battery in time. Right now what's happening is that, A, you're wasting 100 minerals on a battery, and on top of that, you also still lost two workers, which is actually really, really bad for an early game here as a Protos player, super expensive, super, super expensive And there also was no blocking on the opponent's CC, which means that the CC just finishes for free as well This entire thing was completely useless Not only did two probes go down for no reason, but also a battery has been built, which is not going to be providing any value whatsoever in this game anymore for the next maybe what, four minutes. Maybe at the seven minute mark, there's going to be a drop in the main base in which this battery will play a major role in defending But I honestly find it somewhat unlikely I just don't really see it happening Seems like a mind-drop-ish follow-up, as we have two mines coming out already Could be a triple mine drop We have a Robo coming out of JV over here Robo before the second gateway Now, this is interesting, because that means that the moment this gateway, or the warp gate finishes, there's only a single gateway to warp in units with, which usually is, well, consider the mistake because you just have very little units Right now, there's only two units that could be dangerous. That really could be dangerous, having this type of a low unit count There's going to be, I think, two warp in cycles without having a second gateway That means by the time the mine drop hits, I think there's just going to be three stalkers and a single adapt Simply not enough You need to be in the perfect location if you have three stalkers in order to stop a mind drop, even if you have blink Because it just takes so many shots to take that matter of fact down Ideally, you have five stalkers by the time the mind drop comes in You can easily blink in and to volley the meta-back, which is very, very important often Now, here comes the mind drop. What's the vision like right now for our good friend JV? So he has one pylon here Has no vision whatsoever on the top side Has no vision on the right Okay, let me just say like, he has no vision He's blind He sees nothing He has some buildings on the edges, but that's about it That's as far as his vision goes Now, what's the unit movement like? Okay, we're moving towards some, no, there's not a middle ground Okay, this is the opposite Okay, this is the type of move that makes very, very little sense. This is giving me strong, let's just say, I'm very happy that there are no horse races in your town, or at least I hope there are no horse races in your city, because this is giving me strong, betting all my life saving on horse number nine type of violence Like, you're just gambling on one position here where the MEDAVec is going to come in And the worst part is that this position is the easiest scoutable to defend Because all you need to do is either build a pylon here or leave the probe there and you completely cut off that far left side So this area is an area that you never have to blindly go to. Because you can always, 100% of the time, if you take a line base, you can always scout a MEDAVec going there because it's really easy near your third base You still decide to gamble on that location If a METAVac comes in from here, if a METAVac comes in from here, if a MEDAVac comes in from here, which is the case You're going to be out of position The mines are going to end up landing and you will not be capable of getting METAVAC because you're not in time And I think that's what we're going to be seeing here You mentioned that you defended the Airdrop Widow Mines well You lost almost no workers or you lost no. No workers, but it literally doesn't matter. Okay? This game right now, I don't want to say it's over, but this game is really, really good for the Terran. This specific situation, because basically he forced you away from your mineral line. He managed to move to a dead space and he also killed two workers while keeping everything alive. He took no damage whatsoever. He just got three damage in. You're down maybe what, like 250, 200 minerals after that move combining the cost of the two probes that you lost, as well as the probe pull away from the mineral line. You also lost a bunch of gas. Maybe you weren't producing probes all the way through. It is just a terrible, terrible thing. On top of that, you're going to need to, because you didn't actually kill it, you need to keep all of the stalkers at home right now, which means there's not going to be any pressure on the other side of the map And also, in your initial defense, it's really going to suck This meta fact can just boost in over here into your natural, especially if you're out of position like this I would much prefer seeing two stalkers here, two stalkers here. That way you always have some stalkers in position, and if you respond quickly, you'll still be capable of blinking for it and probably sniping it, but right now, if you're not paying attention, then you're not going to get any damage in whatsoever on this matter of fact, and that would really, really suck Now, you're No scout whatsoever, and you play three-gate into double forge This is after an absolutely atrocious early game, Legitimately an atrocious early game Okay? Losing the probes to the Reaper, building the battery for no reason whatsoever, then getting your workers fully scared away from the mineral patches, losing two more workers there, and the Madovac staying alive. You cannot expect to build double fortress, double upgrades, which won't be ready for the first push The first point of pressure where the Tairn is going to test you is going to come before these upgrades finish finish, all of the resources that are being invested into these buildings and into this will not be used in the upcoming push That is a lot of cash that you're losing here And you need to pull out absolutely all the stops in order to make a defense I don't quite see actually how you are going to be capable of making a defense if your opponent micros somewhat competently Like you legitimately have no units You have five stalkers, four of which are still tracking this mine drop. So really defensively currently, seven minutes into the game, you have an adapt, two sentries, one stalker and four zealots and I think an immortal just popped as well This is nothing Your opponent has 71 army supply with plus one Look at this Look at this freaking army, man Is there no combat shield? Combat shields also on the way Now this is, this is actually a move that looks dumb, but might be somewhat smart And the reason for this is is that if you send in a run-by, you force reinforcements to stay at home and also what you can do, you can often keep your, you can kill a couple of workers, which is nice at the same time. You know, it's like a double thing Now, one of the things you do need to do, though, is move your freaking units in position to force field this area or to force field this area or to force field this area because you need to keep a ramp You have zero units currently You have an adept and two sentries, but you have zero map vision, so you have no clue if your opponent is even moving out You're completely blind when it comes to that The idea is very good, but the execution so far is god-awful It's a little bit like the last Airbender movie from, I think it's like 2010 or 2009 Like, the idea is nice, but the actual execution was dog crap. This game, in my mind, should just be completely over Like, there should absolutely be no way that you ever hold this if the Terran focuses down the Super Battery here, the fact that this Super Battery got its entire duration is always really, really bad for the Terran This is pure luck that you manage to survive This is trusting on your opponent's incompetence You should have died here If you do this fight 50 more times, even against Gu, you're going to lose probably 49 out of 50 times This is the one game You're a statistical anomaly in this game You know, you're the lucky guy You're the person that buys lottery tickets and wins and says there was a good decision. No, you just got lucky made It's a terrible decision Buying lottery tickets is one of the worst things you can do in your life The return on investment there is god awful Absolutely terrible It's the same as you did there Okay, now your 1-1 is going to finish I'm really pissed off by this I much would have preferred you just rolling over and dying here Because then you would have been punished Now the feet, this is the problem My man JV over here, he's now getting the feedback that this is a legitimate move This is not a legitimate move This is illegal He got away with an illegal move as not cool. Okay? This is like if you go into your local gas station and you steal a Snickers bar every single day and you never get caught Then maybe you truly start believing that stealing a Snickers bar is allowed No, it's not allowed You just got away with it You just got away with it It's an illegal place I hate it I absolutely hate it Despise this move Freaking double forge after losing four probes in the early game and not clearing the mind drop I'm not sure what happened with the mind drop I'm pretty sure that Hamster will have like a little, you know, a little camera there, like a picture in picture type of stuff I don't know. I think it might have been F2 in or something I don't know what happened there Maybe we'll never know Maybe Hamster won't even show it That'll be quite something I think he will though We'll have to wait and see God, that's exciting What is this? These are stalkers You're an odd position, huh? Very hard position This is an observer A good position It's going to scout any type of move-outs There's a prism on the way as well I don't really like the follow-up here either, honestly, coming out of JV Because we're getting into the territory where ghosts are a possibility, where the mine Holy crap a lot of mines. You've 11 mines? That's a lot of mines, no? Is the main focus just on mine? Holy crap There's 14 marauders and 13 mines This is an insane army That's an actual issue as well here If ghosts come out and you move out with these mines and there's no colossi or disruptors, that's a huge issue for the Protos The Protos just continues without any splash units here, and that somewhat surprises me No storm, no colossus, no disruptors Doesn't surprise me Well, it does surprise me It also confuses me It's bad There's no vision anymore because he rallied the observer into the raven I think there was the second observer that he rallied into the raven, by the way, which is not a great move. Okay, so here we're going to go Trying to sniper mine No, didn't quite get it It is fairly important I don't think it's possible to actually win a fight against this army If you just have pure gate units with immortals, you need splash. It is just simply not possible Look at this 27 zealots Like 16 of those zealots will just die And the rest of them will take so much splash damage That they basically also die Like there's absolutely zero way That a push is going to be held If there's also ghost I was going to say especially if there's ghost But there's going to be ghost So you get EMP and mine splash What is this crap? I've never seen this This is why splash is so important Disruptors against this would be having a field day Or just Colossus as well Would be having a field day there is the potential here for a for a counteract i love this by the way this is the type of move of people that have made mistakes in the past you know these people they know that they always have to when they panic so what do they do they put the prism in face mode yes it is not brilliant it is not beautiful but it does the trick here and i like this type of move is acknowledging a weakness that you have and then saying okay this weakness i can kind of circumvent by putting it in face mode. Often Terrans do this with liberators as well, putting them in like liberation mode Now, this is another fight that you're straight up just going to lose, in my mind at least There's three ghosts out and there's freaking 17 minds So this game is fairly over This is an insane engagement by the way This just came from three sides Holy crap I legitimately think this was one of the most beautiful beautiful engagements I've seen in my life What? I didn't quite appreciate that in the first few sex Look at this He legit has a surround setup From three locations And then he also comes back with these with these stalkers His opponent, this is like a trap This is so satisfying Look at this. It's a slow time speed, slow speed Look at this Wow, look at the mine shots Just killing all the bio Sometimes you have these videos on YouTube where there's like a power washer cleaning a fence very systematically, you know, and I'm not big into power washers or anything, but I like watching that type of stuff every now and again It looks beautiful It's the same with this fight This is the fight you could see on like oddly satisfying Reddit You know, with some like epic music under it or some like some meditation music under it, you know? If you're a little bit down, you can watch this fight again Holy crap, that was beautiful That actually was an insanely good fight. That's so sad as well for JV in a way because he's peaked, you know He's never gonna get a fight like this again in his entire life That was legitimately the best fight he'll ever He fought against like 18 mines He is he forgot to clear the mines Yeah, it's like 16 back home or like 12 back home casually Casual stroll with the boys Yeah, I just do the best Upgrade wise, it's about even Still no extra tech though I don't really like that Robay had to be built like minutes ago and it still needs to be built I also think this is kind of wasteful at this point where it's like, hey, you already dealt so much damage. Is it really necessary to continue throwing away gate units while you're outmining your opponent like by factor 3? Like, no, I don't think that is Like, this is absolutely not necessary And it makes very little sense to me to pull this type of move Like, having like four zealots or so, that's fine But you don't want to commit too many resources to harassing right now because all you really need to do is stay alive The moment you stay alive, we're going to be just fine This guy walk through the mines How did he make it actually? Did he just walk through the first two? And then didn't shoot or I don't quite understand that. Ah, now these mines are going to get cleaned up, I guess, by the DTs Yeah, it makes some sense Well, actually, DT warping is kind of risky If there's a scan going down, you lose like five DTs, which isn't drawn There is blink, though, so could have still blinked away Yeah, just overall, by the way, just a sick, sick position currently for our Protos player Like, if we just actually just analyze this position for a second, like there's three, three going down, or what is this? No, we already have plus three attack There's like plus two shield The moment you're researching shield weapons against a race that can remove your shields instantly, you know you have too much money. You have too many resources You know, it is just too rich, simply too rich Second Robo on the way, Robo Bay This is just such a good position There's nine gateways I wouldn't mind seeing like 10 or maybe 11 gateways And I think a fifth base might be in order as well But really the only thing we're currently lacking once again is map vision Like the only map vision we're having right now, or the JV is having right now is with the units he's attacking with And they're about to die, so not too much of MapVision whatsoever It's really difficult to respond to things if you don't know that they're there. This is one of the rules, not just in StarCraft 2, but in life as well, you know It's really difficult to get rid of like a family of squirrels that's living in your roof if you don't know that they're living in your roof It's practically impossible So you need to gather clues as to what is going on when it comes to squirrels I'm actually sure how you spot squirrels living in your room You probably can just hear them No? I bet squirrels make a crap ton of noise Most rodents make noise A lot of noises are Fairly annoying I wouldn't mind them as much if they would just be quiet all the time You have a family of mice living in my attic. I wouldn't mind it Yeah, okay, this is, this is exactly one of the ways that you could lose here is by having zero map vision and then an army moving in position with, How many mines is this? Seven How does you keep making so many mines? It only has a single factory, right? Yeah Even on a tech lab It has to be some of the sickest mine production I've seen in my life Quick scan I mean, it's still going to get stopped But it, yeah, it shouldn't have It wasn't even close, actually I was going to say it shouldn't have been closed, but it's still not close So maybe even like this, you're not going to be capable of losing. The prism over here on the bottom side This drop is going to get taken out These colossi are going to get healed It's a good defense here, honestly Pretty much, yeah, do like that defense I'm okay with this defense 178 supply against 116 Prism starts going in as well We have the thermal lens coming in right now too, as the triple drops are heading back home 4th cc flying over Actually, yeah, that's the 4th cc Very cool Second starboard on the way Here it is Some nice Zallet harass This is the eye for detail that I need in my life And this is the lack of attention for the actual things that matter as well. This is a detail-oriented person, okay? Look at this I kind of want to go into the first person here I wonder if he even looks at his main area He's like, okay, let me just send my entire main army in the worst possible position He still has no clue Imagine there's an army coming in from here right now or from here or another army just walking in from this location All of that would have been possible But rather than fixing this, well, rather big mistake of having literally, everything out of position We're taking a fifth base, you know, we're microwing the zealots out of the prism, moving the zellate or the prism into position. This pretty much feels like planning your honeymoon with like excruciating detail, like just every single day, every hour planned, and then realizing you don't actually have a girlfriend And trust me, doing a romantic dinner for two, but just yourself, isn't as fun as people say it is It's more sad and a little bit awkward as well Okay, now the army is going to get moved out It took about 45 seconds There was a 45 second window in which if anything had happened, at like this base, the base would have just straight up died, or you would have to burn a recall, which is kind of painful because it wouldn't have been necessary. Game is still completely over despite these minor errors because luckily Gu, the second ranked Chinese player, wasn't on the map because he has no units whatsoever, because this game is completely, completely over Once again, we're moving into a position without knowing anything on the map I mean, I can't really say much about it It's just bad Like, this is just bad Why would you be on the far right position currently? We have no clue where you're, like, if there's maybe like anything on the map Like a medevac with eight marines or two medevacs with like Marauder Marine in there You're just moving blindly, continuously I don't understand how you can play like this this I really don't understand it. It's like the people that walk around a house they've never been in with the lights off because they'll think they know it They remembered it from the one time they walked through I have no clue what these observers are doing either Like they're giving extra vision on your own army I guess against the 17 minds if they still accidentally are there, it would have been nice Like the entire focus here of JV is wrong, but it doesn't matter because he's so ridiculously far ahead. to actually make one note here and that is that there is no sentry in this army which actually is really really bad people kind of forget about this but the sentry is really good as a unit it provides two armor allowing you to basically have five armor upgrades which is huge having five armor upgrades there's no other race that can do that well the ultra has it as well right they have the kiteness plating so they have a creptone of armor but with a century you can provide that for a large portion of your army that is that is fantastic and you should should always in a late game composition have that Always, always, always It is so ridiculously important to have. I can't stress that enough There's also no Prism with this army, which means that reinforcements, the reinforcements are going to be impossible I'm just, what have we been doing? Is this like killing the rocks? He started by taking out these rocks, then he took out the rocks in the middle, now these rocks During this, his opponent actually managed to get somewhat of a decent army, like add like 25 army supply or so into this Now here comes the attack Okay, it's interesting, interesting Vikings start shooting on one of the six Colossi Colossi get microed back Colossi get microed back Start attacking the Command Center Colossus start microing back Attack the Command Center again. How many swipes do you think that these Colosses actually had on the army? With six, I don't think it's more than 14 or 15 swipes I would count it if I wanted to do that, but I don't want to do that Now I'm going to count it, okay? We'll count the stupid swipes Because I feel like there, I'm not saying there might have been more swipes on the command center But, okay, let's just have a look here There is six colossus, okay? Six That's one The first one that hits something That's two 3, 4, 5, 6 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 Okay, 19 swipes with three Colossus. Now, this was a fight that lasted, what, 15 seconds or so? If you would have just A-move, this would have been way, way better But because you were microing your Colossus in such a fancy, weird way, It's like you get these really expensive units that are great in an army, but then you're so afraid to lose them that you forget to actually use it There are some people in the world that have this when they buy a couch I knew a family that bought a really nice, expensive couch, but then what they did is they put covers on top of the couch because they were so afraid of spilling something on it But the covers make the couch look butt ugly. It's the same here It just makes no sense you have this really expensive cool looking thing, why would you hide it with your crap micro and not use it in the fight? This makes absolutely no sense whatsoever It's a low tier move On a scale from 1 to 10, I would give this move a 2 And that's only because you get one point for free because you're a Protos player I like most Protos players So really you should have gotten a 1 out of 10 for that And now you die against the counter This is absolutely You've lost the unloosable game You had the greatest fight in the world in this game and then you had the worst fight in the world. It is just so frustrating to what you play It is actually insane And now you're dead Good job Yeah Timba! It's going down I'm yelling timba I speak a little bit of Chinese This means my favorite song of all time is time is timba by Pitbull and Kisha But Timba is, it is supposed to be spelled Timber Banger of a song as well God, brings you back Nostalgia What also brings me back down to earth is the play that you showcased in this game, as it was pretty terrible You had a constant lack of map vision You never were in position for anything Your macro was quite good, though I like that Your unit composition switches were too slow. You got too many colossus Usually you only want three, and then you transition into disruptors You went up to six, but that isn't even the worst thing It's not the fact that you got six It's the fact that you got six and hardly managed to use them That actually really pisses me off The complaining here also doesn't make a lot of sense You say that the colossus are weak in a fight, but you didn't use them in a fight You used them as like a massive walking distraction for the Vikings to shoot at But that's already the job of the Vikings So they were going to shoot at the Colossi no matter what You could have just aim moved them in. You would have lost them just as fast because your micro didn't actually stop any of the Vikings from shooting at any point It just made your colossi shoot less Your control in this game entirely was fairly bad, except for the one fight Although I believe that was more luck than wisdom I could be wrong Maybe you have a fight like this every single game If that's the case, I want to get more of your replays I'll make a nice little compilation I'll watch it every night before bed I'll be sleeping like a baby every single night Holy crap, that fight was beautiful That was actually the most beautiful fight I've seen in my entire life, I think. Freaking three angles, the minds killed the entire biobal I love that What I didn't love was your play What I didn't love was the blaming of the Colossi despite your crap control You, my friend, suck Terran is not imbalanced That's it All right That actually is going to be it Thanks all so much for watching I hope you didn't enjoy this episode of Is it Inbalanced or do I suck?

        "text": "Dear Captain, Bainlings are just O-P I started with a golden double proxy reaper, where my micro was close to perfect, only losing all of my reapers to some lynx and a queen Now, these two sentences are mutually exclusive If your micro is close to perfect, you wouldn't lose all of your reapers to some links and a queen But whatever After I scouted exactly what he was doing, Zirks' constant pressure made it so I could never leave the map to attack Even though I built full blue flame halions, mines and Thor's, the perfect counter to his Ling-Bain Murakamp, I was forced to turtle up as he sent unending waves of units. I trades so efficiently, but he just had too many units in his never-ending swarm So, is Zirk imba? It is All right, thanks for watching Bye-bye Or do I just suck? Asked by the Stutt Muffy, a Terran player in silver on the North American ladder And here we are in the game between the Stutt Muffy, here in the bottom right as a red Terran, and Fuzzy Wuzzy as our Blue Zirk player Great names, by the way, for both of them Fairly impressive that silver players apparently just have more time on their hands to make good name I like that he's elongating his time where he's in the vision range as well Rather than going, oh crap, I've been spotted. Look at this, look at this Look how painfully long this days Here he gets spotted Yeah, somewhere around here He walks and he's like, oh crap, I got spotted I can't build it here And rather than just moving to the right side, he moves all the way through the vision of the overlords to the left Also, I mean, to be fair, to be fair to the Stadmafi, how could he have figured out where that first Ovalord was going to go I mean, yes, the overlord almost always goes in a straight line to the natural of the Terran player, or at least initially makes that, this type of line and then maybe go to the right to scout proxy raxes. So I guess it was difficult to predict, because this only happens in 95 to 98% of all ZVTs, where the first overlord makes this type of move But, ay, aye, that is a very painful start That is actually a very painful start It got spotted But I'm not sure if it got spotted, spotted I don't think it did, because it's just a straight-up hatch first coming out of fuzzy-wuzzy You saw the SUVs like, ah, it's just an early scout to make sure I didn't have a third base or whatever it would have been So instead we're just seeing a, I mean, a proxy 2-Rex is always going to be powerful against the hatchery first. Now, there is a, is this a fast gas? Is this gas in time? I'm not sure if this gas is in time, actually I think it might be in time Yeah There will be some downtime on this initial barracks There's no second gas on the way So I guess it's just, oh, there's going to be a gas on the way right now So it's going to be a bunch of reapers here, exactly like the Stutt Muffy set in his palace complaint form The near perfect micro with the reapers into losing all of them to some links and a queen, I think, is what he said Bunker, I like this actually Just building it behind so that drones don't see it. Now, usually Zirks kind of have their overlord near their natural, so this type of stuff, it can be sneaked in, you know? That's a big deal when this does happen, because you can't pull the drones against that, that bunker is going to finish up Nice little start here for the Stadmofi I really do like that Forgets to start the orbital command, which is an issue in my mind, and in the mind of every terran that has ever lived The reason for that is because whenever you get an orbital command, that just means you're going to end up getting, what like 225 minerals every 64 seconds out of a mule So it's an investment that pays off within a minute. Unless you're planning on just killing your opponent with your 2-Rex proxy reaper, it's almost always just straight up going to be worth it And also with this builder, you're just floating money, so you might as well, right? It's not like this is some three-rex marine stuff or four-rex marine stuff where maybe you can't quite afford it Although I think with most builds, honestly, Taryn always gets it Reaper being controlled relatively well The macro is not being controlled quite as well We're seeing some major flotation here Some major, major flotation of the money Let's just say, if Stadmaffy was on water right now, he'd be rising to the top, my friends He would not drop down like a rock Closer to wood. It's the consistency of wood What do you got? The density of wood It just floats on top of water That's what he's doing right now Because he's flowing a crap ton of money 600 minerals, still no orbital command Now we finally start sending workers into gas That means that a factory or of course a command center on the high ground is possible I do kind of like the command center on the high ground because I think that Stadmafi scouted the fact that there was a fast speed being researched And that means that if you do get a command center on the low ground, that potentially could get taken out So this bunker is going to get these reaper go in there. It felt like this position has been severely compromised at this point Still three reapers alive This isn't actually this is one hell of a bunker by the way What is this bunker defending? It's like defending two buildings that can flow away This is one of these positions where you really don't care about it So let's just analyze this position for a second, okay? So if you're really a Zerk player and you see a bunker here, you literally do not care about this whatsoever This is a red herring bunker You see this and you might think that there's something important there, but this is just an area you don't need to go You can take this as a third base. You can take this as a third You can basically expand three, four, five And then once you got five bases, you can think about taking out this bunker Before that, there's no priority here whatsoever This sometimes happens, though, is where people attack into this anyway, because they believe it's important It's like when you're having a Before we continue with the captain's great next analogy, I would like to briefly mention what's happening on screen because, as you can see, the Zerk is trying to get the high ground to prevent a Reaper jump in in the main But this little elevating platform right here is just a visual asset and cannot be used by the Reaper. In fact, it is impossible to jump from that very low ground in the back into the main base There's absolutely no way for the Reaper to go up, the ramp and the same goes for the other side on the left It also is impossible to jump from that back third into the natural So if the Reapers go back there they pretty much lock themselves in and the only thing you need to guard is the ramp But I guess our Zirk player just is a great Star Wars fan and always has to keep the high ground Back to you Kevin. It's like when you're having a fight about like who's supposed to do the laundry and in the the heat of the fight, all of a sudden you find yourself defending the use of green jalapeno peppers as a potent lexative or something like that, which is not, it should not be used as a potent lexative It should be used to make your food slightly more spicy, although sometimes it doubles as well as a lexative in some scenarios In the end of the day, you know, you have to do the laundry and you lose the argument about the jalapeno peppers And that's what ends up happening as well if you attack this type of bunker There's really no point to it. Just stick to the script And the script here for the Zerk is going to be just to expand to third, the fourth basis, and that type of stuff Meanwhile, at home for the Teren, we have one factory done, a second factory on the way So I'm kind of feeling Blue Flame Helions here as a follow-up I'm loving this bunker Right now, this CV is saying, why did I build this bunker here again? I just remember getting the instructions for it, and I follow them What are we defending here? What is the strategical purpose of this bunker? He's actually trying to Is he setting up an attack here on the bunker? And he's spotting it right now I'm like, hmm That looks interesting. Maybe I should go for it Pools the queens for this as well That is a wild move, no? Like the bunker's gone It was an illusion after all Fantastic stuff Okay, it's going to be blue flame Hallion Oh, I thought the first thing he built was a reactor, but it actually was a, uh, the Tech Lab All of this is being completely spotted by the way by Fuzzy Wazi, who has had some good overlords just seeing absolutely everything I would love to just see a single Marine being built here just for that Yeah, I think these two Marines, I completely agree with this call At the same time, I also wouldn't mind getting a third CC here in the far back. You already have your natural up and running, you have your main base up and running, you already have good production, you don't really need to add on to that, especially not before getting a third base Often Terran players get like a one one type of setup against Zirk and then get that third base already So, I mean, a third base in my mind is long overdue I appreciate the effort you're putting into getting a lot of Hellions out because that is really what you're doing, which also is, honestly, on this map quite a debatable choice I just have to admit it here Like just take a look at how this map tends to play out Okay. What is the goal with Helions? A lot of Helions in the early game is often to deal damage Now, this is legitimately, nah, not the, yeah, probably the worst map actually for it Dead and Stargazers, because you can defend three bases by having a bunch of queens or a wall with like a rogeron and an Evo chamber or a bainling nest in an Evo chamber in the wall And then the helions can't get in anymore So it makes any type of mess Helium build on this particular map fairly weak So the strategical choices here that Stadmuffy is making are fairly old I'm also surprised if we're seeing you straight up hell You never see this You never see this. Do Hellbats take longer to build than Hellions? I bet they do I don't know why, but I have a feeling about it I think Hellions take 18 seconds, no? And Hellbats take 21 I'm not I'm starting to second guess myself Trying to doubt myself, whether Hellions actually take 21 seconds or 18 I wish I could see another Hellion in production, but so far it's only Hellbat I'm sure we'll see a Hellion later on though Not to worry We can always figure it We'll table this for now Double Medivac as well? Oh, this is just going to be a straight-up Hellbat attack Hellbats with Medivacs for healing This is fantastic I also like the Depot drops being used here. No third base yet for the Stadmafi Interesting to see here Liberator coming out as well No scouting, of course No idea what's going on No idea of a third base I mean, you have one of the most powerful map control units in the Hellion Haven't used it once Instead, we're going for a double drop Now, let's take a look at the actual situation here What would have happened if 10 helmets with Blue Flame supported by two Madafax would have made their way across the map? In combination with these five Reapers as well, they would have straight up won the game There's absolutely nothing here that can defend the push Fuzzy Wuzzy is playing extremely greedy. And the stuff Stuttmuffy, look at this, look at the investment that the Stutt Muffy made in things that aren't eco Triple factories, we have a starport out as well, an armory is out, and then we're getting a third Cc So you'd say, okay, this is an aggressive build where you want to deal damage to slow down your opponent's eco or straight up kill your opponent But this couldn't be further from the truth This is actually just a harassment build And a harassment build in this case makes no sense whatsoever because your opponent has so many more workers if you invest this much in infrastructure initially that you'll need to kill 40 workers to be even. Now, four halberts with Blue Flame are very good and we can actually see them dealing a fair bunch of damage, but I mean, queens are a thing and they're just going to be capable of taking this out So far I think, what, maybe you kill like seven, eight extra drones or so It's just not enough Fuzzy Wuzzy is also floating a crap ton of money Scouted the spire, though We see an immediate Thor coming out as a response I do like that Double Tor being a cued up This is a Terran trick This is how they make Terran propaganda Not many people know this actually But the way that Terran propaganda is created is that they'll take these screenshots of like a Stadmafi. We'll do this, right? He'll take a screenshot of his own bank and compare it to the Zurich Bank Look how much better my macro is But then in reality, Terrans will have like 17 SUVs queued up or in this case just an extra tour over here is these type of tricks that Terran will use to pretend like they have good macro I sometimes also see this in pro games where there's just like five SEVs queued up They say, man, this Terran is macroing so perfect Look at the money It's like 12 marines being built in one barracks without a reactor It's like, all right, buddy, calm down It's not that great macro It's just, you know, you can queue up It's different. Another thing that is very interesting to me here, by the way, is the fact that the Stutt Muffy mentioned constant pressure being put on by the Zerk Well, in reality, the Zerk in the first nine minutes and 13 seconds has put in exactly zero pressure None Absolutely none So if you were to make kind of like a pressure skill and compare it with real life events, you'd have like being the president of a big and powerful country is very high up there, you know, or being a football player while 80,000 people are watching Like I can imagine there's a lot of pressure on you there. But what the Stutt Muffy currently has experienced is a lot closer to being a casual Hockey Suck player Hackysack? Hackysack? Huckysack? It's a little thing at like a family reunion or something like that You're playing with your cousin and your brother and maybe your dad It's like no real competition No one's even really keeping track of the score And if you miss the, what's I called? The Sack then, I guess, or the hacky? I don't know what it's called It's like the little bag I guess that would be called the sack And inside are the hackies Wouldn't surprise me Where was I in my story? Right The amount of pressure that you're feeling is closer to a family reunion. Hacky sack face off with your cousin and your brother Then it is to, let's say, being the president of the United States of America There's just not a whole other pressure here on the Stadmafi And I don't think he can claim otherwise I really like this dedication to the Flores Lava as well There's some good cosplaying coming out of the Stadmafi I also really like the fact that he kind of figured out how to battle the fake news and how to battle like this information He figured out that if he just doesn't get any information whatsoever, he also can't be tricked And he's absolutely brilliant Smart man It's the equivalent of just shutting off the internet. We should get tricked by one fake news article You're like, all right, no more scouting for me I've been tricked one too many times in my career He's really struggling What are these stores here? I love the priority Look at that Look at his priority seeking here He's like 15 muras fighting with the three liberators You have these two massive guys with guns They're trying to chase an oval or towards the right side Trying to deny scouting of the Ford Gas Oh no He might see that I have three SUVs in it He could make the call that I'm playing Mac It's like, all right, calm down, buddy This is a really poor defense. I love that he actually had the Thor's ready as well for the Muras because he saw the Spire earlier But then still didn't have anything There was no turrets in position in the No, maybe there was one, maybe he lost it I can't recall that I think there might have been a turret there There was no turret in the third base, though That's one thing I do know for sure Oh, here comes the drop Right A brilliant move as well actually I hadn't thought of this, but going in with four Metafax, uh, filled with with eight halberts while your opponent is playing muralist That is the type of move that you just need some big brain for that. I didn't mention it earlier, but whenever people send in an imbalance complaint form, they also have to write down their email And I won't reveal the email of the Stuttmuffy because you guys might flame him But I will say that the number 57 was in there And what I thought was that we might have one of the oldest people, you know, like, what, 66 or so, that's playing StarCraft I was like, ah, it's his, his, his, his birth year I thought I was kind of excited by it, you know, it's like, as an old fella just playing StarCraft in silver But now I'm starting to believe that the 57 might actually be just Stut-Maffy bragging about his IQ. Because so far this game, the, the level of decisions has been extremely low, just extremely low It's kind of painful to watch here How are these Thor's never in position? How is it possible? 22 mutas have gone down, and out of those 22 muras, only seven have been killed by Thor's That means that turrets and liberators did the rest I don't even understand that The wall is up as well, oh no The sickest thing is that there's no reason for this wall to even be down Stutt Muffy hasn't moved out in the past seven minutes, except for when he did it with Metafax So there's absolutely no point These are some nice splits as well here on the Bainix Oh no. I hate it when I forget to lift my 400 mineral structure To be fair, orbital commands only have 1500 HP So Stutmuffy had what, like maybe six or seven seconds to response That is fairly little time for someone with the reaction speed of, of Stuttmofy But maybe it's both Maybe he just has slow responses because he's like 66 But the reason why the 57 was in his email address is because he also has 57 IQ It's like a double, you know? Sometimes people just get lucky like that when they have a double in life When one number represents two things at the same time Ah, I wish I was as lucky as Stadmuffy Here I am. Born in 94 with an IQ of 185 Stop the cap If only I was so lucky as Stadmafi Life ain't fair Okay, Borough viewing researched here for the Fuzzy Wazi, who's by the way doing a great job expanding Creep spread Well, let's not talk about that It's not been great, but the expanding I've been a fan of I really have been a fan of that Mine's doing some work Love the positioning of them as well 27 meters have gone down Stadmuffy not quite understanding that this game perhaps is over. as he's technically right now on two bases but the Thor's might actually there's a queen wall this has to be the latest queen walk I've seen in my life this wasn't like a queen brute lord timing which you sometimes see you know this was like a legit Ling Bain muta queen walk the queen started walking as well at like the nine minute mark but because there's no creep on the map or overlord highway overlord speed highway you know there's uh it took him a while to get there this was an anticipated queen attack sadly this base was already gone where these vikings doing 58 bailings on the way holy crap that's kind of wild look the amount of energy we have as on the orbitals i don't quite understand how that is possible i feel like that is one of the things that you definitely would kind of get at this point now it's like okay i have well actually has a lot of how is it possible that he's floating money when he's mining with 24 SUVs. It's not even really mining with 24 Where are the SUVs? What? Oh, they're all just idling Yeah, I was wondering I saw like two SUVs here and I saw like six SUVs mining dispatch I was like, how is this possible? But I guess they were just all idling Legitimately like 75% of his workforce idling It's like visiting France It's insane Every single time in my life that I visited France, public transport is striking I've been to France, like six or seven times, and every single time, like, your train will get cancelled because there's a strike going on. Do French people actually work, or do they just pretend to? You do see people, like, walking around there in business suits as well, but because it's in Paris, it might also just be because, you know, it's like a fashion week or something like that He's trying to look good I'm not completely, my working theory is that there's no work being done in France on a daily basis But I'm open I have an open mind to different theories as well If you, for example, have a theory on what happens in France on a weekday, be sure to leave that down in the comments I'm curious to hear what you all have to think about that If you've ever been to France, of course. I don't know French bashing if you haven't been there It's an acquired taste that you don't really understand unless you've been there You need to get it It's a feeling Okay French bashing You need to be there to get the street crad for it Otherwise, it ain't fair This game is extremely over And the only reason why the Stuttmuffy currently is staying in is because this is his first ladder game That wasn't in the imbalance complaint from him, but I figured it out This is his first ladder game And the Stutmuffy believes that this is similar to the co-op mission where you have to defend the main building for 25 minutes And if you manage to do that, you win the game. No matter how crap your performance was before that As long as that main building survives, he's all good In this case, he's like, oh, I can build multiple main buildings This is fantastic This mission is way easier than co-op Um, while in reality, his opponent currently has actually, let's do some counting with Kevin New segment That da-da-da-da-da-da-tac counting with Kevin Did, do one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, eleven, eleven, eleven, 11 bases for Fuzzy Wuzzy Oh my, he really messed up, didn't he? Told you No point Against one, two, three, four The Stadmuffy That was counting with Kevin Back to you Oh, back to myself, really She was dressed up again. I miss dressing up as different people and talking to myself Always, you know, felt like I had some friends recording these conversations, hearing nothing back But then in the editing room it all comes together That's what really matters This is one I love that Fuzzy Wuzzy doesn't really want this game to end He's like mining more in this game than he has in the past 75 games combined It's like, oh, usually I get like one base or two bays all in, but this is fantastic He's like he's practicing his macro, like building more drones There's 96 workers Eight more, no problem Plus two on the way as well Oh, this is an interesting command It's like a move command through the wall. That doesn't quite work Holy crap I wonder what the actual resources lost The research is lost isn't even that bad Like, it's not good Don't get me wrong, but you would have thought that it would be a little bit better But I guess it really isn't 103 workers are out right now for Fuzzy Wuzzy No upgrades which just disappoint me a little bit There's two Evo Chambers who'd love to see a second spire as well Well, I like this getting plus to a flyer attack Well, in my mind, he's never going to build a muda in his life because every single time he builds mudas, he just flies them into mines There's still 15 mines remaining. Have we had a single overseer yet? No Do we actually think that Fuzzy Wuzzy is aware of detection and how that works? I'm not sure if that's like, what league do people become aware of things like detection? I think pretty, like, it's really, like, it's a lot It's one of the more important rules, no, is that you can see invisible stuff Because otherwise you just die I remember this absolutely frustrated ever living crap out of me when I started playing StarCraft I think there's legit invisible units and if you don't have something to see them, you lose the game. I always thought it was fairly broken until I started spamming DT builds myself and then all of sudden I started liking StarCraft a whole lot more I like this base stayed up as well Honestly, if you just look at the supply and not at the mini map or at the bank, or at the bank, Or at the worker count Or actually not even at the supply If you look at the army supply currently, you might think that the Taryn is winning But you would be mistaken Because there's currently an 11K 4K bank for the Zirk player, while there is Well, it's actually a 2K bank, or 1K1K bank here for Stadmafi Which is fairly impressive 11 more drones And a second layer. This is the type of spending that you only do when you have too much money, you know? It's like people buying a second yacht It's like, do you really need a second yacht? Like you already had one You can just rent a second yard? It just doesn't make a whole lot of sense Also, yards in general don't make a lot of sense Like, the concept of a yacht just It's very, very odd to me I guess it's just feeling safe, maybe, for very rich people, like on a yacht in the middle of the sea But then again, if you're an absolute billionaire, the people that will want to take you out are also going to be very rich. So they can just shoot you down from like a helicopter or something, like some special mission team coming to catch you on your yacht But what's the point? It's just like a crap house It's on water Like, it's way more expensive to build than a house of the same size And it's going to be worse as well because you're on water You can get seasick What if you get a medical emergency? Like that type of stuff I never quite understood yachts I don't quite understand keeping all the halberts in the same position so the baling splash deals more So the bailing splash deals more damage But then again, I'm also not a a brilliant terran player like Stutt Mafias. I like that he's continuously walling, though If there's one thing that Stutt Mafia has. Done well and right now according to my count he has done exactly just a single thing correct that would be the walling here is that he continuously rewals it and he understands the importance of walling that. To be fair this is a fairly easy wall to make just four Depots so it's very easy unlike a lot of Protoss walls which are harder to make with Pylons and stuff. Oh god this is an actual meat grinder. Like an actual meat grinder. It's only 11K difference though. Oh. We need to add some bases to the count. Oh my god I can't even recall where I ended last time. Did I count this already? This I can I don't know. How many bases are on this map? That would have been easier to count. Oh, it's a bit overwhelming for me right now. There's so many blue dots on the mini map. That I quite honestly feel afraid to uh yeah i feel very very afraid to start counting like what if i miss one and people will make fun of me i'm not down with that that's for sure. Pettingin glance of course i like he's getting all these upgrades for units that i know he's not going to build this is like some high-level posing you know this is not real like i know there's not going to be Infestors or more Mutalisks but he got plus two armor for the Mutalisks i still don't really really believed that there is Overseers on the way. Oh, here we go Okay, that was a really bad fight I'm almost starting to believe And the 25 minute is getting close So right at this point in the game, the Stutt Maffy was getting ready He was like, oh my god, this was the big final wave You know, at the end in the co-op mission, there's like drop pots coming from the sky That's also why he left the main The mines in the main base and the Reaper there is like, oh, what if there's a drop pod in my main base? It's like, this is brilliant He's already preparing for this stuff I really, really do like that There's some brilliant stuff He's like just walling again and again. It's like doing the countdown 52, 51, 50 Meanwhile, the big final wave is being set up 2 2 halfway done Seven more halberts being produced Boom, another commenced I'm so rich anyway I'll morph it into a planetary I'll float it to the corner Just 35 more seconds and I got it Mother Refinery Oh Is this the first time Fuzzy Wuzzy sees this base? I think it might have been though I think it might have been The Stutt Muffy still is not worried at this point Yeah, this is fine I don't need this I still have three commands, now two command senders over here It's all good Oh my God, it's going to be another one of these, isn't it? Oh, cheesh. That's the zoomers would say Yeah, right now the countdown is truly happening here for Stad Maffy Four, three, two, one One Well, what a big win there for the Terran player Very, very impressive No, just kidding All right, let's get back into it Got him People that weren't paying attention for a bit They had me on on the background Absolutely in shambles right now Oh, is this the first moveout? I think this is legitimately the first move out that the Stutt Mafia has done in Well, ever since the Reapers, I Oh, no, the Hellbad drops I forgot about the Hellbad drops How could I? How could I have forgotten about the Hellbad drops? Oh, harsh them You silly goose. You silly, silly, silly goose Four more Thor's on the way as well You know, the funny thing is, is this is an army That could almost beat the opponent's army No, it could It actually could Look at this Eleven halberts? If the mines were here especially And if there were more helbats Why, hell? No, no Fight! Fight the lynx! If all of these were helbets and imposition, I think these lynx could have died Legitimately If the mines were there, definitely Okay, now this push is gone This is starting to feel a little bit like the Black Knight in Monty Python. You know? The studmuffy believes it's just a flash wound, but in reality his heart has stopped beating like 25 minutes ago or so Now stand aside, worthy adversary Tis but a scratch A scratch? Your arms off No, it isn't But what's that then? I've heard worse The moment the Proxy Rex Reaper stopped working 45K against 27K So he's almost, well, well, Fuzzy was his doubling the resources lost, but at the same time he's also like quadrippling the amount of bases that the stud mafia's had Because we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen bases Had it very fast Oh, I forgot to do the jingle Ah Counting with Kevin jingle A modern day classic. I consider selling the counting with Kevin concept to TV studios or maybe to Netflix But I don't think the world is ready for this yet We have another attack One of my favorite things, I kind of want to just show this fight again My favorite thing is that the Stutt Muffy, rather than just closing the wall entirely, leaves one open because he knows that Fuzzy Wuzzy will go for a move command in So then you keep the small funnel for longer If you fool wall, there's a good likelihood that the Bailings bust through it immediately and then there's a bigger hole, you know, because you kill two depots at the same time or three depots at the same time. That's actually a pretty clever move I believe that clever move is unintentional The only reason I believe it's unintentional is because we haven't seen any other clever moves yet And clever moves are something that is kind of related, you know? Like certain things in life is like random You don't know Like the things aren't necessarily completely connected to one another another But usually when it comes to intelligent place, these things are connected It's the same with intelligent thought And so far the Stutt Maffee has shown very little when it comes to this Although, I have to admit, I like the planetary I'm a fan of the planetary in this position as well, because this position has seen a lot of blood. This position has seen so much blood I don't like how close the mines are to the planetary That I do not enjoy as much Because then with the bailing splash, they get a lot of blood This position has seen so much I don't like how close the mines are to the planetary That I do not enjoy as much Because then with the bailing splash, they get taken out And one of the big things of these minds is because there is no overseers, these might have been way too efficient. If these bad boys would have been here from the start, like just on the low ground for the past 15 minutes or so ever since the Muras died, I feel like they would have been helpful I actually really believe it would be helpful I'm also thinking, is the planetary actually good? I think the answer might be no, because it's a structure that can be taken out relatively quickly And it makes the Stutt Muffy feel more secure in the forward position Well, he should be hiding behind the wall He's shooting stuff from there I like that there's a tank now That's a really high tier decision making Poof! 40 kills! What is this? No way What? This mine has 91 kills. I clicked it before it died It had 101 I've never seen a mine with 101 kills That is actually the most insane thing ever No? I think this is the highest, this is a world record, my friends This is actually a world record mine Look at this guy Poof 101 is what I saw Yeah Before he dies due to the bailing splash I actually cannot believe that 101 kills That is crazy There is more kills than the Stad Mafia has brain cells N I Q Combined Got him 102 workers left for the Fuzzy Wuzzy This is a fantastic game I feel like it's slowly but surely creeping towards an end though. As, well, the economic situation for the Stutt Murphy is rather dire at this point There's nine more drones Fuzzy Wuzzy just continues with the drones as well It's like, I feel like the one thing I'm currently lacking is not tech or maybe better upgrades or hive No He says, yeah, that's a hive He's getting a better upgrades Oh my, my, I said nothing Or maybe, you know, broodlords or investors or roaches or ravagers He's like, no, the one thing I need right now is nine more drones I just love that he has a plan and he sticks with it The plan is Ling-Bain-Ling drone and sticking with the plan I'm a huge fan of that. But I say again, don't fix it if it ain't broke And, I mean, this strategy definitely ain't broke It might be broken because it's very overpowered according to the Stadmafi, of course That's still a claim we're looking into right now Don't forget that Don't forget the entertaining factor here It might be kind of obfuscating Nice word Obfuscating The fact that we're also doing on a very serious endeavor here, and that's trying to figure out whether this is imbalanced or whether the Stutmuffy sucks We need to take all evidence into account Ah, no, the drones get taken out Better rebuild those We only have 102 left while your opponent is mining with six workers Well, mining with two Ooh, e-base. It's like it has more HP, more bang for your buck when it comes to Walling I like that A little bit late into the game to think of that when you have 53 supply I mean, he knows Okay, this just doesn't make any sense to me What is this? He knows that there are bases here He sees the creep here as well He knows this He is fully aware of how crap his position is Why are we still in here? Maybe it just doesn't value his own time very much Surely there are better ways to spend your time than this, but you know it ain't working Some nasty mine shots 75 Ha ha ha! 75 Gigi. Fool? How is he the fool? This is coming from the guy that stayed in the game that was over 18 minutes ago Holy crap How dare you complain about any other race? If Taryn has this many good defensive setups, that it was impossible for our brilliant Zirk player Fuzzy Wuzzy to finish this game He was up, legit, with like nine bases He had nine more bases than you He didn't just have nine bases, no He had nine more He had 13 bases You had four at the game end You didn't even mine from one of the base You didn't even completely mine it out This is insanity You just, you just, you just wasted Fuzzy Wazi's time. And this person, Fuzzy Wazi is a very solid member of society You can feel it, you know He's doing good things for the world He's smart He's fast He builds links and bainlings He loves a good economy It's huge onto the economy But you, all you do is you spam mines, hell, bets and Thor's Your thors are absolutely never in position for the MUDAS ever You freaking scout the spire And you still manage to lose infinite workers to Muralesk, you never move out on the map, you open up with a freaking triple factory double reactor build and you take no map control with a unit whose entire purpose is to take map control, the Hellion or the Hellbat. You could have killed your opponent with an initial Hellbat push extremely easily, even with your micro, which to be fair has been extremely bad There just got awful I don't think I've seen a single split on any of your Hellbat's And yes, I also haven't seen a single split out of your opponent, but your opponent actually was macroing during it and doing other things You weren't macroing You weren't microing I'm starting to believe that you were doing one of those challenges where you do multiple games at the same time and not just two games I believe that you were doing a challenge where you're playing nine or ten games at the same time. You're like a trackmania race, winning a game of Dota two, playing League of Legends with like your left pinky, the same of your feet, you're playing like some racing game or whatever Like everything at the same time And then you lost this game It's like, oh, they look pretty broken I don't understand how you can ever in a million years complain if this is legitimately how you play There's no sense of build order There's no sense of any decision making or coherent decision making that makes any type of sense to me You, my friend, suck And he suck extremely hard And that is it All right Yeah, that is actually it as well Rather long episode of IOLIS I'm sorry for that. I don't enjoy that either These long episodes, you know, they hurt my brain, this type of games Oh, also, final thing If you think that 57 is the birth year, the year of birth, of what is it called, Stuffy Mafi, Stutt Mafi, leave that down in the comments below If you think it says IQ, also leave that in the comments If you have a better theory, be also sure to tell me that in the comments I'm very curious I'm a big comment reader I'm not many people know this, but I love the comments But usually there's no questions that I ask to be answered But today, two questions I can't remember the first one anymore, but two questions for the comments. That will be it Like the video and share it with your friends It's also important, especially if they haven't played StarCraft before And just keep sending it again and again if they ask why you're sending it to them So to kind of add on to the confusion as well You send it the first time It's like, hey, what is this? like no response, just send the, keep sending the link until they watch it or they block you There's no in between All right, thanks for watching Bye-bye."

        "text": "Dear Harstam, Terran Widow Minds and Battlecruisers are the biggest form of Imba I just played a 30th minute game of Protos versus Terran as a chill FOF game tonight What in the world is FOF? OF meaning Stends for in texting It stands for frown on face Related words, middle finger emoji So he played a middle finger emoji game tonight and got absolutely destroyed by widow mines and battle cruisers Widow mines are just way too easy to micro, and the fact that they are also invisible when armory is existing is even more ridiculous. In this game I outmined and outsized my opponent's army at many times, but that does not matter for his widow mines just bang, bang, bang and poof, all of my army is gone In this game I remixed at least three times, and each time his imba widow mines would just destroy my army over and over again I'd just like to note that he mentioned this is a 30-ish-minute game, and he says he maxed out at least three times That's not actually that much, is it? Three times in a 30-minute game That's not that impressive But whatever There's no reason he should win this game when his micro and macro are considerably worse than mine. I know I'm in no position to say that I'm skillful But at the very least, I think that 140 APM is greater than 40 That is indeed true 140 is greater than 40 Nice Showing a good understanding of basic meth there Listen to you I hope you'd agree with that Yeah, I do And after my whole army gets destroyed, he just comes in with his battle cruisers And yay! My whole infrastructure gets destroyed because battle cruisers, OP And also, at the end of the match, when he had his massive battle cruiser swarm in my main base, my stalkers outnumbered him one to five one to five He repeated that, so I repeated it as well. And his battle cruisers just melted them the same way that his widow mines did For these reasons, I believe that widow mines and battle cruisers are imba, and that they deserve to be nerve-hammered to the absolute ground, as they are no skill one-click win cons, which trade way too well against any other race For these reasons alone, I believe that widow minds and battle cruisers are imba, and there is no doubt about it name, AS Frog, race protos, league silver, with 2,513 MMR on the North American server And the question is pretty simple Are battle cruisers Inba? Or does he suck? Here we go with AS Frog against S J Tiny Heads DC Tiny Heads DC. Maybe that's like Marvel DCs? Like one of them comics Maybe he's a comic hero It's very possible I'm not a huge fan of superheroes, but we'll leave that rant to another time We're playing on waterfall here, which is a beautiful map, not only because there are birds flying around here I spotted one earlier, but also because it is not that large of a map with just really like six and a half viable bases per side Well, yeah, six and a half bases in total per side Ooh, this is an interesting opener It's going to be a 60 Nexus Look at that Well, technically this is now a 17 Nexus He just forgot to build the probes No, it turned into a 70x. I think this could have been an 18 nexus So skipping gas, I think, is a pretty cool move in PVT, and there are some build orders that work quite well with it But it only really makes sense if you're skipping gas so that you can get a faster nexus If you're skipping gas and then floating 150 minerals while you're building your nexus, the skipping gas part doesn't make that much sense, and I'm not actually a huge fan of it This is very similar, though, to the parting build order except poorly executed It's just a, it's a poor execution of a bit builder and that makes sense because we're in a silver game. I'm not going to be too nitpicky on all of that crap You know, I'm expecting, my expectations are a bit lower than usual If I'm seeing this in a Grandmaster game, you know, like floating the 250 mineral before the piling goes down, an inevitable supply block, this type of stuff, I can kind of see that You know, I'm sure that S J Tiny Heads DC is also making similar mistakes here He built a barracks and forgot to build a unit out of it, for example No, actually, it's a Marine Never mind Oh, he sent it across the map Well, then I rather have he didn't build the unit He's just going to send it across the map. You scout with an SUV, not with Marines This is just not very good 99% of the time it's not even going to get across the map alive because in a debt will just kill it for free You should never be capable of running into someone's main base This first unit is obviously fairly late Normally, the first unit from a Protos player finishes at 2 minutes and 22 or 21 seconds This time it's going to, well, finish about half a minute later, which is really not ideal But once again, we're watching a silver game here So we just need to lower the bar overall a little bit This is an eBay This is a reactor This is a base without any defense whatsoever. There are two Marines somewhere on the map, but I don't quite see them Oh, they're right next to the commands They're standing in the shadow of the CC here as we have continued worker production or almost continued worker production A lot of cash in the bank as well Two workers right now considering building a building Now all of this isn't very tight Okay I said we're not going to be too nitpicky when it comes to the build order But this is a particularly bad builder Like it just looks really bad There's no point in floating What was this? So he built two gateways or A pylon Then a gateway And then another gateway, but it doesn't build. So he might as well cancel this one And then he gets a Nexus somewhere Yeah Yeah, so the money disappear I don't quite understand these He's also pulling out of gas Or maybe he never sent them into gas I think that's the case I was going to say that's a very high-level move pulling out of gas, but I don't think there's any high-level moves in this game, honestly I think it's going to be low-level moves all the way throughout I still am wondering why this gate cancel happened Now he's going to rebuild them Or it's going to be tech Two pilots, right? Don't want to get supply block That's fair That's fair Pilons are somewhat important here. I'm just really confused what's going on here I also like the way he's building Just everything, well, I don't like it, but it looks pretty They serve no purpose whatsoever Oh, ah, okay I understand now what's happening here Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I don't know what these probes are doing out there, moving from natural into the main base to saturate a gas That's all good The gateway over here and the gateway over here weren't aesthetically pleasing And the most important thing when building a base in war is not that it has functionality or that the buildings get constructed at the correct time It is that they are aesthetically pleasing from the bird point of view, of course Very smart AS Frog. Really getting the priority straight here It's as if you're building a bridge and you're allowed to hire 10 people And every single person you hire is a color designer And they spent all day deciding on the color of the bridge or the color palais The color palette Why do I keep saying palais? Because I have a little bit of French in me, maybe The color palette of the bridge And then you get one voluntary engineer that works for three hours a week on the bridge as well I'm sure that it's going to be the prettiest bridge ever built But I wouldn't want to be the first one to drive my car over it or the second one to drive my car over it. I'm not too sure if it would survive a second car So let's not even discuss the possibility of a third car Okay Mines get spotted here This was an interesting move there He pokes up the ramp with two stalkers, loses both of them two mines, and then does nothing again, which technically is the correct move, because I think he saw the fact that there was a couple of extra mines So right now, on top of this ramp, we have 13 mines and a tank That's enough mines to take out every single stalker, and then a bit more He has some mines over for the change as well This is actually the first time that I've seen someone build like this. You can see that a lot of thought is being put into where all the buildings are positioned. There was a Gateway here before that got cancelled and because it wasn't nice and symmetrical earlier, it wasn't allowed to be built. But now it's a look. It's actually, he's trying to build different size buildings or different types of buildings on the opposite ends, then Gateway Gateway over here, then Gateways here. So the inner ring is all Gateways. This is fantastic to watch. This is a design mastermind, AS Frog. If you're looking for any designers, I actually have the email of AS Frog and I can forward it to you. He said, we can find this guy a job if he's not working yet. To be fair, so far when it comes to the build order, I don't think he's the brains of any operation, but God does he know how to make things look pretty? Third base is done already as well We have 1K minerals in the bank, not the biggest deal, because there's quite a bit of income We have decent info Look at Four more pylons in the middle beautiful stuff Twilight Council on the bottom side I can't even recall what I was going to say The beauty is just, it is something else You know, it's doing things, giving me emotions, you know I'm feeling these things that I didn't know I could feel It's crazy Fort Bay is on the way. I like all of this Just standing outside There's no reason to attack upper ramp into 35 mines If you're out expanding your opponent this heart, I'm loving this Robo Bay, honestly, after scouting all the minds, getting a couple of disruptors is obviously going to be the correct call here It is 100% what you want to be doing Twilight Council for Blink as well is going to be quite nice I wouldn't mind seeing an observer being built Okay, we already have that And then that observer eventually moving across the map Force fuels could be used here to catch the mines, but you of course also could chase the mines forever and hit them once every five seconds It's also allowed. Both options are completely valid Big warpin of stalkers on top of this ramp, and you'll just take out these mines I actually really like the position currently that A S Frog is in He's up in workers He is getting pretty decent infrastructure He's getting good upgrades I'm a huge fan of the shield weapons here personally But, you know, it is, it is what it is Like, I much rather would have had an armor upgrade, just because of Ghost And given that A S Frog hasn't really scouted yet, except for the mines I feel like it might have been worth the scout with a hallucination as well right now, just confirming that it is Mac. That would have been a very nice thing to confirm There's a mine run by coming in It's one of these things you never really see How did these mines even run past? I guess they went out of the base when AS Frog was chasing the two mines all the way back to his own fort So third base is being set up Despite there being a contain, this is one hell of a contain This is like containing someone in their castle and then allowing them to build a farm right in front of you So they can continue producing food It's like, that's entirely not the point of a contain. With the contain kind of, You want to keep your opponent on the amount of bases they're already on while you're expanding to more bases so that your eco-lead grows so big that you just out-peruse your opponent in a massive way Six more gateways, Templar Archives What is this? He's actually just making patterns At first I thought he was wanting to protect these pylons in the middle, but he's just doing it for the pure aesthetic Because this is the least protected structure right now, these pylons They're on the edge There's no point in that It's actually insane Blink hasn't finished yet We have no disruptors, which I really, really hate. There's no observer with this army yet, despite there being a couple of observers on the map already And having observers with the army would obviously be huge, because then you can take out the mines This base should have never been allowed to get constructed either Okay, so you see the mines there? What are we, okay Send the entire army over here to deal with this one mine If he walks into it and doesn't kill it before it shoots, I'll be upset Okay, I'm not upset Now, we still remember that there were some mines on the other location as well, right? Hello? The mines over here that we just lost two stalkers to? Surely we saw that. What is this repositioning of the observers? Oh, okay, there was one being rallied to it Okay, I don't mind it It took a long time I mean, the mine's got the shot again, but it is what it is The threat gets dealt with There is a lot of money in the bank currently, which is frustrating me, because I feel like this money could be spent rather well on really anything to just kill this base This base should be getting killed right now It is very weak still It has a couple of tanks, but it also has a lot of mines, which should not be useful whatsoever the moment you get a single disruptor. Like a single purification nova, can probably kill five, six mines here in one, shot and you outrange a tank as well Should you just stand over here? Boom Shoot at the minds You do that twice and then you just A move in and you pretty much win the game by killing the third base At least in my mind, that is what's supposed to happen here The one thing I really like that A S Godd, AS Frog is doing here is, well, first of all, obviously the aesthetic of his main base, but also the fact that he continues to expand and has a rather high work account I think that is generally a good thing to do Observer speed. I'm a fan of as well It's just, he's not really using there He's 400 APM just there What was he doing? I don't know I see that again What is he clicking so fast? Okay, right now he has zero APM I'm not even sure how that's possible because I'm seeing stuff happen 160 Hello? Show me the APM, you prick There you go Current, 83 16, 0, 268, 48, 4366 That was very fast He said he had 140 APM while his opponent had 40 I guess that's at the end of the game then Because right now he's at 95 May I also say, by the way, that bragging about your speed while you're losing actually shows that you're not that smart. It's a little bit as Actually, let me just show this one Let me show this Imagine Imagine you brag about how fast you can play notes on the guitar Okay, and you get in a guitar battle with Jimmy Hendricks And then the moment you're forced to play, you just do this Take that, Jimmy I don't think a lot of people are going to be impressed Just like when you press the buttons really quickly in StarCraft 2 and you're not actually doing anything, not a lot of people are going to be impressed either It's not so much about smashing your guitar very fast or smashing your keyboard very fast It's about playing the correct notes or doing things that matter in the game. And so far, you haven't really done anything that matters in this game You went for a contain without containing your opponent You walked multiple into minds that you had full vision of And basically, I'm not saying, you This base is just It's so beautiful Anyway, and also you're just letting your opponent get away with way too much Like you have a massive army, you have a huge eco, massive production, 18 gateways You're capable Like, this How is this base getting up? How are you not denying this? You've had map control since minute three and a half Ever since the Marine went across the map and got killed by you? your opponent hasn't been in control of this game at all whatsoever. You've been in control the entire time and you haven't done anything with it You have vision of this base, but no vision on this base You allow this bad boy to go up, which is a planetary, by the way Third base is a planetary That's a big move Not a fan of it, but it did happen Like, none of these positions are actually very well defended There's 36 mines and four tanks out that means that per base, that's an average of one tank And the way that it's currently set up, it means it's two tanks per one base And that's it Mines should never be capable of defending a base by themselves That's what tanks are for. Like, tanks and mines are a little bit better, but just tanks by them, or just mines by themselves, are completely useless Because stalkers literally outrange them Your tier one unit outranges mine Well, tier one and a half or whatever it is Tier two? What is a stalker actually? Gateway would be Tier 1 and then with a cybernetics cork like Gate, like Tier 1 and a half Because Robo units are Tier 2 or Tier 3 then And then a Colossus would be Tier 4 And actually no Feels very confusing to me So I am not sure. If you have thoughts on what type of unit a stalker is, be sure to leave that down in the comments below and let other people flame each other and we can have a little infight in our community on whether it's a one and a half or tier two, or maybe some people have the weird opinion that a stalker technically is tier three, because you also need a pylon in order to build a gateway first You know, I don't know You can make loads of arguments for anything This move, I don't even mind If it was executed with a bit more Buh, a bit more schwaver, more feeling Because this really isn't quite it. You moved half of your army into your opponent's mines and tanks, and you also manage to stand in range of the tanks that are on the low ground You do manage to spot all the starports though, but at the same time being destroyed by Battle Crusoeuv What are there are upgrades actually? Two two upgrades, two upgrades relatively even Now, a good trick that I want to teach you early on in your StarCraft 2 career is the trick of focus firing, and that's attacking one battle cruiser before the other, rather than spreading damage out over 10 battle cruisers or over five battle cruisers Yeah, this, that is correct No, one at the same time, there we go And don't switch targets midway through either. That really helps in your journey when trying to take out big fat units like the BC Now, you're going to be capable of clearing this eventually, hopefully Yeah, there we go Because you have so many gateways Sadly, everything in your opponent's main base also gets cleaned up because I guess he walked in mines and killed all your stalkers But now you are aware of the fact that battle cruisers are out Now, by some people's standards, battle cruisers are a tier 9 unit In my mind it's like tier 3 and a half You might want to tack into something that deals with battle cruisers a little bit better than stalkers Or, okay, let me rephrase that phrase that. Stalkers by themselves are actually kind of okay at dealing with battle cruisers But the way that you use stalkers against battle cruisers with poor target fire, with no stutter stepping forward so that all your stalkers can shoot is not a proper way I'd much prefer seeing Tempest here in order to deal with PCs Tempest, long range, easy to control, shoot by themselves You can have some stalker kind of support there And then you have a very solid army You're sticking with pure stalkers for now 43 stalkers By themselves, also fine And I would even encourage you move like this if you would ever do any correct movement with these stalkers or honestly do anything that is correct with these stalkers. This base still is up and going You should have, you haven't even scouted that And this base has been mining for a while now I'm soon getting some mineral patches going to mine out I have a feeling that this base is just going to mine out completely as well These mines are going to deter you from ever going up here Like the moment you see one mine seems to scare the ever living crap out of you As five new battle cruiser being produced, five are already out as well If plus one infantry weapons on the way It's an interesting upgrade to get at this point in the game Surely that's where the priority right now should be for the Terran player. On a pure Mec army, does he even have a barracks? He must have one He's building factories He has one barracks He's built three marines, I think, in this entire game, with none of them being alive And rather than getting the planetary range or the building armor, he's going to get plus one infantry I mean, I'm not one to easily criticize people, but that surely is a mistake Probably a misclick We'll put it, you know what, that was a misclick, 100% These mines are still here as well Now the battle cruisers are moving out You spot this with your stalker army So you could move there to deal with the battle cruisers, or you could hold this position for another 25 seconds. Moving in is the correct it, blink under it, target, blink, blink, bink, puff! Shoot, shoot, shoot one more? Can we do it? Ooh, what are these Archons doing? Is there Yamato? There's no Yamato cannon Yamato against Arcons is pretty powerful Do like this blinking, oh my god, the cannons to really finish this base This is the sickest base I've seen in my life I don't even think I could make this You know? I've played Sargra for a long time, but I can't build this this I don't have the, did this eye for aesthetic that you have ASFROC I do have an eye for taking out Ford bases though, which is something that you've still not done. Oh, ah, this is when aesthetic gets in the way of functionality When you completely filled your base with buildings that you can't enter your own base anymore to deal with seven battle cruisers that are there I think this is the point where you said that battle cruisers teleport into my base and take out every single piece of infrastructure Yeah, it's fairly unfortunate when that happens There's actually still one path Look at that They're coming in one by one right now I think you might actually end up killing some of these, all of those BCs actually This wasn't even that bad This was fairly okay, honestly, for you at the end of the day. If your opponent didn't have a forward base, I think you'd be ahead Maybe you're still ahead It's so difficult to say whether you're ahead or not, because in my mind, you've been ahead this entire game, but you just haven't used it So are you really ahead in that case? It's like imagine you're doing a five-kilometer foot race, you know, and someone starts at the midway point and then starts running in the wrong direction Is he really ahead at that point? Like yes, he's ahead in the distance, but you know that being ahead doesn't mean anything It's completely irrelevant to the actual race Beautiful Fireworks God, I wish there was an observer close by that could spot these Sadly, that's not the case. So, I guess we'll just have to live with these mines shooting us at every opportunity that they get Position our entire army on top of it as well And then get seven more mines to burrow on top of us Oh, how unfortunate If only we had some vision close by, oh no, not the second wave Who could have thought that mines get to recharge? Oh, that is ridiculous God Can't believe we just lost 45 supply like that He's going to gather his forces again and max out so he can walk over the same mines once more He hasn't lost enough units yet to these mines There are mines with legit four kills, three of those being arcons. It's like mines that killed more than like 1,400 resources lost It's like the most effective mines in the history of mines These mines haven't seen any action yet I have two battle cruisers securing this base If this base gets to go up, I'm going to be extremely upset Honestly, if any base gets to go up, I'm going to be extremely upset because there's nothing to secure bases There's like four tanks in the natural defending the turrets and the command center And everything outranges this It is just not possible that this is defending this position it should not be possible in my mind And yet it's happening And it's extremely frustrating to watch this Because the macro, he said micro and macro. The macro hasn't been that bad The macro actually has been quite good out of AAS Rock The micro has been non-existent He mentioned out-microying his opponent I haven't seen that yet Because in order to out-micro your opponent, you need to show micro And there was no micro yet There have been move commands Oh, here we go again But this time, with observers Now, does he realize that Arcons don't outrange mines? That is a very difficult question Maybe he blinks on top of him That would also be hilarious in a really sad way Oh, takes out some of these mines Burrow Here we go Please don't kill all He killed every single observer, except for this one. You know what really would make life easier for lower level Protoss players? If we would introduce something on the observer called Observer mode, where it would turn Where it would turn into a static unit that provides more detection vision and more vision overall That would be so helpful So then when you A move or F2A move your entire army into a Mine position, your observers don't fly in and get splashed by the Mines I wish that was a thing, but sadly for AS Frog, that is not the case yet He's now taking his seventh base, but I don't think money is really the issue Now, some people can be as rich as they want. They're still not going to be capable of doing anything useful with it You know, this AS Frog is the type of guy that has like a 5 million inheritance and buys 5 million worth of scratch tickets And he keeps doing that again and again until all of his money is gone and then starts complaining that scratch tickets are overpowered because he can't win anything with it Like this can't actually be serious, right? Like he knows these mines are here How does he keep This mine has six kills Like all of these mines have like four or five, six kills There's just stalkers He's warping stalkers on top of mines If they shoot again, I'm gonna be so upset Okay, now he's walking away. That's good Okay, he spots units on the other side with this Probe Scout, I guess, five Probe Scout, a classic I also do it at the start of my game This is so unbelievable 15 more stalkers to throw away Like this is just one planetary, just go into it He's probably afraid of mines being there or something He's like, I'm not blinking into this Poof, shoots it, two shots it and out Beautiful Next Okay, you follow the SCVs Follow your nose Come on, mate Yes, there we go So SUV is being taken out Hop, hop, hop There's mines here, put it in Observer mode, A move into this position Battlecruis is going in That's not enough BCs Honestly, it's not enough PCs. You can fight this They teleport it in as well They're not safe These are going to die for free Beautiful stuff You don't even have to look at this anymore Just let these units attack by themselves Probably goes better than when you look at it Mine's still over here Five kills on this one Seven kills All stalkers and arcons Uh-oh Oh, oh, oh Pum, bam, padam, pam, Pamparam, Pampadaam Pam, padam, Pam, Pah, bam, Pam, Pahdam Oh, you saw that explode? That's actually pretty sick This is the run by of the century That's for sure Look at this It's legit a pure mine army That's something I've never seen before How many is this? 43 mines total. I think this is almost all of them There's a couple left over here, couple left over here as well I can't believe that this base is still up by the way It has been spotted at this point You can attack this You can do it You can do it It is just mines, my friend They're static Set it up in observer mode Oh, also yes Let's hope he doesn't scan Victory for the good guys I can't believe it He knew how to do it all along Maybe he googled a tutorial midway through Now, the APM went up He's been clicking faster than ever before He lost three or four How many is that? There's like three or two stalkers in his entire engagement. Killed 40 mines or 30 mines Beautiful Now, now that we've done this once, surely we're going to be capable of replicating this success It seems unlikely to be me that after such a sick engagement, you'd go back to your old ways of running stalkers into mines, right? That would seem ridiculous And there is no way that he would ever do that again I can't believe it I just won't believe it It's not going to happen From this point on out, A S Frog is going to clear up every mine position with ease now that he has figured it out After he's done moving around back and forth in this area, he's celebrating the victory I don't even mind that. You're, if you have such a good fight for the first time in the game, you're allowed to you know, kind of bathe in that victory, you know? Just sit there and, who, just let it, let it fall all over you, that victory Ooh, the sweet, sweet victory Beautiful stuff Next one We can do it Yeah Cheeky blink into the mine position Yeah Ah That happens But we're not moving away We realize that after the mines have shot, that they need time to recharge This is honestly still a better fight than 90% of all other fights in this game and thus an overall win for us because we're probably still outmining our opponent as well This base was almost empty. It literally mined out in gas, which is impressive Now, at the same time, S J Tiny Heads, DC is also saving up about, what is this is going to be, like 16 battle cruisers or something, which is impressive If a battle transition, a battle cruiser transition is one of the most difficult things to do in Terran versus Protols Because if you build them one by one, it takes very long to get to a good number If you build them three by three, it takes a little less long to get to a good number But there's a very large period, or still a very significant period in which you don't have enough PCs that they really mean anything. And there's a lot of supply just missing, which is basically in battle cruisers So that point is right now, or well, that point has been for the past three and a half minutes where these BCs have been building and kind of just collecting in the bottom left side of the map And BCs in large numbers are actually really scary, especially if you only have stalkers, because stalkers are a tier one and a half unit and battle cruisers are tier 17 So you're always got to be very careful there If the BCs get across the map and you're not in position, it sucks Now, a quick take that I do have against BCs is to get a Guardian Shield. A single sentry does so, so much against Battle Cruisers, because Guardian Shield provides two armor for everything within the Guardian Shield, which can be honestly basically every single unit on the entire map, because Guardian Shield has a massive freaking radius Now, against battle cruisers that attack at a very high pace, that plus two armor is actually huge It just helps so, so much It's just like having plus two armor against Marines It helps an absolute crapton, except against these Marines, because they already have plus one infantry weapons Let's not forget the Chris He's building a new Marine He's the fourth Marine in the game, this bad boy. The first one, though, with plus one infantry weapons, so surely he's going to make a difference Bob the Marine No combat shield, no stim, but plus one infantry Gonna stand over the mines I'm not sure what he's going to do actually It's going to clear this pylon with two tanks Very cool I mean, surely these mines are enough to stop our good friend A S Frog from ever doing anything whatsoever The problem with allowing your opponent this type of battle cruiser transition is that once they get there, oh, hold that thought Shah Oh, but we learned See? Sure, the start here was rough and we might have lost a lot of stalkers for free, but now we're going to clear up this position. And nothing is going to stop us, except maybe the 17 battle cruisers in the main base That actually might be a minor issue I say a minor issue, I mean, now truly all the infrastructure is being taken out in a big So we have 17 battle cruisers against 41 stalkers The end of the match, when he had his massive battle cruiser swarm in my main base, my stalkers outnumbered him 1 to 5 And he reiterated 1 to 5 in all caps Now, I dropped out all of my math courses in university after 3 5 weeks But 41 divided by 17 I don't think that gets to 5 or even close to 5 Does it? Probably a little bit close to 2 5 or. 3-ish 2 5, 2 6, something like that So that was a lie You're not allowed to lie to me People that lie to me, bad things happen to them Those are facts Can you remember anyone that ever lied to me? No, because I made them disappear See? It's pretty crazy if you think about it Also, you're not really fighting with your entire stalker army against these PCs, are you? It's like half your stalker army and the rest is running away At this point, it's 35 to 15 Honestly, you're not even performing that bad Like, you're actually, no, 13 against 25 Like, this goes way better than you probably would think it is. The funny thing is people always believe that if they have a lot of units of something, that then should beat less units of something, even if the supply of the actual army is way higher for the less units That makes no sense Imagine you would have four colossi against like 20 Marines You wouldn't expect the Marines to be capable of building the Colossi just because there's 20 Marines No, the Colossus A is a hard counter to the Marine and B, even if the even if the Marines outnumber them, that doesn't have to say anything about the supply that is there Like currently there's freaking 12 massive, like what is it, six supply units against 31 two supply units. Like supply-wise, this is better, isn't it? I think so I'm so bad at math, honestly I'm so ridiculous I can't even Yeah, it's bad More supply in the better is just a terrible blink I don't think it's going to matter whatsoever This also was not a great blink, straight into the BCs Honestly, the moment you allow your opponent to ever transition into BCs like this, I'm not saying you deserve to lose, but you really do kind of deserve to lose. It's a bit as if you have a one versus one fight with someone, and the guy starts like mining iron ore in front of you, like makes his own forge and starts just like blacksmithing like a massive sword, a really sharp sword, and then stabs you with it And then you start complaining about how sharp the sword actually is It's like, well, maybe it has less to do with the fact that it's such a, you know, a sharp tool and more to do with the fact that you allowed him to do all of that to get there while you were in such a good position You could have just punched them at any point during the process. Well, it's like doing the mining or whatever And you probably would have won, you know, the fist fight I don't think the sword has much to do with it I honestly don't even quite understand how you would complain about this game game, you legitimately lost, like, how many stalkers? You lost 268 stalkers and your opponent lost 104 minds, despite you outranging mines and having 14 observers as well Like, you just kept walking into the same position again and again I don't think I've ever seen minds be disefficient without doing anything They just sat there They weren't actively being managed They sat there and you walked into them You're like the guy. At one time I went for a game of laser tech or laser quest, I think it might be called in some areas of the world, like England And there was like a Santa, like a static Santa at some point And whenever you would walk past him with like your thing, he would shoot you and he would lose 100 points And there was one kid in my party on my team that kept walking by Santa And Santa would continuously shoot him And my team would lose 100 points again and again and again and again You're that kid that was in my team ASROC You're the guy that walks into the Santa while Santa shoot you with his laser tag gun. And it pissed me off to no end back then, and it pisses me off to no end back now as well Or, well, back now, right now You, my friend, just freaking suck and it's time to accept it Stop walking into Widow mines Widow mines and battlecruisers are tricky to deal with, but they weren't even being used this game My man literally just left the mines wherever he borrowed them and didn't even stack up battlecruisers properly So no reason to complain about this whatsoever You massively sucked And that is going to be it That's the truth Truth of the matter Life is life That also is going to be it for me today Thanks everyone so much for watching. I hope you did enjoy this episode of Is it Inba? Or do I suck where we had another sucker Perhaps next week is going to be different Maybe you're the one that is different from all the other suckers Be sure to send in your replay in the Google form that is below in the description And I'll see all of you next time Don't forget to hit the bell That would be swell and hit the thumbs up as well Bye-bye."

        "text": "Dear Harstam, let's start with one thing I definitely suck I make many mistakes in this game from an unrefined opener, missing several SUVs, and not paying attention when I should have been However, my opponent makes many mistakes too, throwing away units, being totally out of position and having no map vision whatsoever However, these mistakes do not matter for my opponent is playing the Protos race Battery overcharge basically makes Protos unkillable in the early game no matter how large the army difference is Disruptors are such a punishing unit Not paying attention for a second can lead to losing 30 plus supply. What is the worst thing that can happen if the Prodoll is sitting in their bases and paying attention for a second or two? They have to pop Battery Overcharge Terran instantly loses the game To summarize, I feel that Protos can get away with making so many more mistakes than Terran, and that my opponent this game did little to deserve this win So tell me, Captain, is it Inba, or do I suck? Name, disrespect, raise Terran in the Grandmaster League on North America Well, first of all, disrespect, congratulations on your Grandmaster rank, especially giving your, well, rather visible limitations as a person, because you talk about the frequency of mistakes as being one of the most important things in your imbalance complaint. from you say, pro-dose players make way more mistakes than Taryn, and yet they can get away with it But you don't actually talk about how big the mistake is This is as if you go out every single day to the Starbucks to buy a $5 coffee Now, over 100 days, this adds up to $500, which is a lot of money And you could say, in a way, this is poor, you know, poor spending, really I mean, you can make coffee cheaper at home You could say that's a bad decision And that in a hundred days is a hundred bad decisions So many mistakes. And at the same time disrespect, what if the neighbor of this person buys an ice sculpture of his dog every two months that costs 900 euros? Well, it's going to be more expensive Let me tell you that much I was trying to do the math internally how many days is in a month, and I couldn't get to it But 900 is more than 500 So even if you're only going to get a single ice sculpture in a hundred days, you still spend 400 euros more, which arguably is, well, money less well spent I don't think dogs are very much into sculptures of themselves or ice sculptures of themselves But then again, I am no dog expert, though. I wouldn't be capable of figuring that out What I am an expert on, though, is the Terran versus Protos matchup Having played loads of Terran versus Protises from both sides as a Terran as well as a Protos, I feel like I have a pretty decent understanding of this And I'm looking forward to all of this You mentioned an unrefined build order and I'm curious to see what this unrefined build order entails Actually, I'm quite curious because the build orders for Taryn in the TVP matchup are pretty straightforward most of the time You either go into some type of one-one-one, or you're playing some type of 3-1-1 with a fast 3-Rex before the factory. So yeah, I'm just, I'm looking forward to what this is going to be Could also be a triple-CC, obviously It's going to be a Factory I think this is a very good standard opener Marine first into a quick Reactor gives you a lot of safe Safety, safety, safety It allows you the possibility to skip a Bunker in the natural for a little while because a single Adept isn't going to be capable of killing you and neither is a single Stalker majority of the time You usually have to build a Bunker and you can focus that money somewhere else Like, for example, adding more Barracks Okay This is interesting Now this isn't necessarily bad a Barracks Factory into a second Barracks. And this is a build that we actually saw happen a lot in Intellextream MESSAR SCATOWITES, especially from double gas openers Because with double gas openers, often Protos responds with a Stargate, then it can rush out a quick cyclone and then go into three racks And three racks with a cyclone against Stargate openers are really quite strong and have a lot of aggressive potential They scare the Protos player They keep the Terrance safe in the early, so I like that I'm not as huge a fan of it with a single refinery, single refinery, fast command center type of build But yeah, no, actually, I'm just not a huge fan of that I'm going to be real with you. Because the cyclone, it is so late that it really can't be used aggressively as a tool for map control Yeah, I don't know I'm just not a real back fan of it Unless you're going into some type of three-racks tank all in, which is also a viable strategy, just bump out a lot of Marines, one cyclone, and then two tanks, pull eight, nine workers across the map, which is a, it's a build order that gets played You're going to be completely, what is this? You have a bunker Okay? You don't have to chase the stalkers if you have a bunker You can hide behind the bunker This makes absolutely, this is like buying a shield and then standing in front of it. Like hit me with the shield behind your back It's like unless you're being backstpped, it's not that useful It's the case here as well Fast third base coming out of the Protos player who's playing a blink into Robo Build Order with two gates as well. kind of old school mind drop would have done really well against this build i'm gonna have to just add it in here i'm kind of sad that we're seeing this i'm just not a huge fan of this so we're getting okay it's just like a three wrecks follow up this is yeah i don't really like this build too much but it it is playable and i've seen it i've seen it played before as well no ebay being added though and no third gas either um yeah that is Interesting, no SEVs building So the reason why I'm saying no third gas here is because the second gas was quite late We're rushing into a star port. We don't have cash yet for a plus one And the moment this reactor finishes We're not going to have cash for medevacs either because we're already investing in marauders at this point, which costs gas So you're rushing out a starport with a reactor to build half a medevac Or you have to cut in your unit production Like you are, you're not cutting in your unit production It does, it's going to be a single meta-fac This is And it doesn't have plus one This is not an unrefined build This is not a build What does unrefined means? Oh, look The definition of unrefined is not processed to remove impurities or unwanted elements. Now, this entire build is an unwanted element, because nothing in here so far is good You have your marauders too fast so that you can't produce metaphax don't have a quick plus one You're going to hit a late timing, despite not doing any pressure whatsoever Like, the reason why this build is kind of good is because you can hit pretty tight timings You're not investing into a fast metafact You're not investing into extra mines or extra tanks from the factory There's very minimal investment from all of those things You get a pretty quick starboard, and you have three barracks pumping out marauders and Marines really early on But you're not using any of that. You don't have an eBay to actually boost your bio units So, no I don't actually think this is ever a thing It's starting your eBay at the six minute mark This is just an all-in, but it's an all-in that hits late and with less stuff than a regular macro build does Okay, it doesn't Yeah, no, it's not a good build This is just really not a good build Luckily for you, though, our good friend Honda Civic has also opened up with an interesting one He only has a single colossus out for whatever reason I'm quite sure what happened here I wasn't paying too much attention to to our good friend the Civic it feels like you have enough units. The problem here for pros that you need to defend in between this area, right? So we look at this You kind of want to defend here If you're defending in your third base, Terran walks into your natural If you're defending in your natural, Terran walks into the third There's really no good way about it On top of that, we see like five, six marauders, only a single Colossus without range Yeah, without range No upgrades, no nothing So if marauders do a majority of the tanking, which should be possible because, well, Colossus only has six range here, then life pretty much sucks There's an interesting target fire here This is not Grandmaster Micro This is not Grandmaster Micro. What? What was the micro in decision making here? Sorry, one second I'm going to check to make sure this guy's actually GM How do you figure that out? All right, I checked it, and apparently disrespect is at least that Grand Master MMR, but currently not in GM I just want to go over this one again Okay, this is The decision making and the control here makes so little sense to me Like, I just don't quite understand Okay, so here we see Okay, let's just take a look at the vision here What do we have? So we have six marauders in this army, one METAVAC, a bunch of Marines You take out this pylon, which is good. So you have free access into the natural of your opponent right now Then on top of that, you see your opponent is moving into this general area to try and defend their natural, which is probably an okay decision So disrespect sees this and starts jumping on it But rather than just taking out the army and using the marauders to tank, what we're seeing here is a move command practically onto the Colossus, which then moves back But it doesn't just, that isn't just all there is He just stands in the Colossus fire and continues going and tries again After already doing the same trick before, losing half of his army, he goes for it again. This is like, if you're stuck in a hallway and you have two doors and there's like a keyhole and you peep through the keyhole, through the one door you see a monster with seven hats chewing on some human remains, and in the other keyhole, you see a turtle that is trying to get to his carrot Like, you decide to go for the seven-headed monster My friend, if you were a main character in Harry Potter, you wouldn't have made it alive through the first hundred pages of the Philosopher's Stone This is some hot garbage-tier decision-making over here This entire natural was open You could have killed every single worker There was no battery to be used here anymore. So you could have taken a good fight as well in your opponent's natural on top of that Or you could have cleared every worker here, just continued stimming Don't forget, your opponent didn't even have thermal lands yet So chasing with a six-range colossus, trying to kill six marauders and 25 Marines, it's going to take a while And it also exposed you immediately It was like five stalkers with this and two slow zealots This was legitimately the worst defensive army You should have won this game five times over Like, Hero Marine wins fight like this when there's three colossi out Well, that's not entirely true, when there's two colossal and like five, six more units Like, this was a win. Like your build order was terrible and yes, it wasn't all in, but you should have won with it You actually should have a no, you're actually in a crap spot Your opponent has 68 workers, has two Colosses out The only thing your opponent is lacking is map vision It's no map vision whatsoever So it's going to take a little bit of damage here, most likely, at least against these marines Love the focus here on the pylon Just denying that And don't think that's too bad We have a drop here on the bottom This is good Pretty decent movement I like this a lot You kind of realize your opponent has no vision whatsoever on the map and you just go in. Deal enough damage Okay, well, problem solved again Kill like, what, 24 workers or so Have you scouted the fact that there's a fort base yet? Not really? your third base also is it feels like your build has nothing how is that even possible i mean you did spend your money somewhat okay why how is it that you have laid everything and quick nothing it is really wonderful to have this i heard that companies hire disrespect to make things less efficient like you know how you have like efficiency consultants this is an inefficiency consultant you know if a process is going to streamlined you can hire him to go into a different company, like a competitor's company. Disrespect will go in there, and he'll absolutely destroy any processes that they had, that they were very efficient He's an absolute king at that How is it possible like your third base lands at the nine minute mark? And you don't even have plus one yet I just don't see how it is I also don't quite understand Okay, TVP is a little bit like a massage in a way, okay? And what I mean with that is that you need to apply constant pressure all the time, like a medium level of pressure You can just stab the guy your massaging and then do nothing for five minutes, take the knife out and stab him again It feels like that's what you're currently doing. You just had a pretty big engagement over here or like a pretty, pretty decent situation over here Did he get rallied accidentally across the web? No What? What is the adventure of Danny the Disruptor? This is the sickest move I've seen in my life What is this? crap That is legitimately one of the worst moves that I've seen in the entirety of human history And it worked out I can't even recall I feel like I was flaming you about something else before Ah, right The fact that you're not applying any pressure whatsoever I'm sorry, just lost my train of thought there You're not applying any pressure whatsoever after dealing so much damage You have momentum on your side. You had a crap ton of metaphax And rather than actually working with that advantage where you know, you depower some buildings, stop the upgrade from going and continue drop keeping map control, you're allowing your opponent to probe up back to 77 after he only had 50 workers There's like 27 workers they're allowed to build They're on four bases, continued upgrade, storm Everything is allowed Look at that The difference earlier was like 90 supply against, I don't even know what it was, like 90 supply against 140, 130 Now it's 127 against, well, it should have been 160 This move I want to talk about as well Holy crap, what is this? Okay. So, now you might be thinking this is a great piece of harassment And Another reason why Protos is so extremely broken, right? Because that is pretty much what you said He said, this is what it was about What was it like you said? Let me figure that out real fast Disruptors are such a punishing unit Not paying attention for a second can lead to losing 30 plus supply What's the worst thing that can happen if a Protos sitting in their base isn't paying attention for a second or two? Well, first of all, it isn't not paying attention for two seconds This is not having any map vision whatsoever. The furthest vision that you have are these two widow minds, which I have no clue by their hair Why wouldn't you just put a widow mine in this location? So the moment something moves out, you see it, and your widow mine actually shoots at it Why aren't your meta-vex on the map? Why don't you have any vision out on the map? The reason why moves like this are not played at high level is not because all high-level protos players are complete idiots The reason why it isn't played on high levels is because if you are running across the map with a lone disruptor and the terran is on the map as well, the disruptor dies and the disruptor isn't there anymore. This is an extremely risky move that against a Terran that has any type, any resemblance of map vision, it would not work and the disruptor would die for free, which is quite frankly pretty garbage And on top of that, you say, what's the worst thing that can happen if a Protos sitting in their base isn't paying attention for a second or two? Well, what's the worst thing that can happen if a prox doesn't pay attention for a second or two? Yes, Taryn doesn't have a unit like the disruptor, and that is pretty normal because StarCraft 2 is a game that isn't symmetrically balanced It isn't that everyone has just soldiers and they shoot each other It would be terrible. No, we have different strengths and different weaknesses Terran, for example, doesn't really need to worry about anything in the early game, except maybe an Oracle flying in and buzzing down three workers before it runs out of energy No, Taryn can basically block their mini map and not look at the mini map for the first seven minutes of the game Protos, however, blinks for half a second too long You lost two mineral lines because widow mines burrow in there They're at lightning speed What do you mean? What's the worst thing that can happen in two seconds? Literally every single game that gets played We see a freaking widow mind flying kill 14 workers at every single level. Like two seconds is a creptone of time This isn't just two seconds either This is like 30 seconds of this disruptor moving across the map and you being completely unaware because you have no map vision whatsoever If a toss is over here with his army and you manage to get your entire army into their main base because the toss has no spotting either, the toss is that as well You can recall, yes Enjoy recalling into 150 supply army Terran That's going to go real well for the Protos player Quick tip, that's sarcasm It isn't going to go real well The disruptor move was hot garbage and it should have never worked. It worked this time, but this is an absolute freak scenario, which also kind of is on you due to not having any map vision whatsoever or any map control at all So now you're moving out You waited for your ghost You waited for five Vikings You have an entire control group for all of this I find it impressive I'm not going to say anything about this, but a lot of terrorists actually control their army with just a single control group And I honestly find that more impressive than bad Like Clem also does it so I can't say, hey, change it, because Clem has really sick control So if you're good with this, then I guess you're just good with this. Now, there are a couple of Vikings still over here at the third base I would like for these to be added on, just kind of ready on Also shows that he's not F-2ing, actually Look at that Actual army control Beautiful stuff Okay, that wasn't the hottest fight here? I'm quite sure if I'd still want to try and attack into this You see the Super Battery going as well? Surely this is not going to go very well Okay, look, I understand that the Super Battery is annoying, right? It sucks It's annoying to play against, but it is fairly visible You know what's happening It happened before or over. over here as well when the Colossus was there with the initial fight, perhaps you shouldn't make the same mistake twice You know, if you go to a swimming pool and you dive in and the swimming pool is empty because there's no water in it, you're not going to take the stairs outside of the swimming pool, go to the diving board and try a second time No, you figured it out after the first time or you're in the hospital, one of the two, or maybe a combination of the two Here's the same thing. You start with a pretty big purification nova on your army and then you make the bad decision to continue finding despite knowing that there's going to be a super battery there and then you continue to engage into the super battery rather than pulling back the moment you see it activated This doesn't really show that that Protos is overpowered defensively It shows that you just have really bad decision making and don't understand when you need to do certain things You can't read the cues and the cues were there my friend, they really were Just need to read into them a little bit better Okay, end up taking out some disruptors This fight is this guy is Uber over Proto's player just continues expanding. really fast as well You finally have your fourth base Protoss already has his fifth setup, continued upgrades I'm still honestly stunned by the fact that you managed to get to 5,200 MMR on North America without getting your upgrades before the 12 minute mark. Going Getting to not getting to two started before the 12 minute mark It's honestly impressive And this is not like this was a low eco game Now this was just a standard game Protoss actually has dealt two worker kills That's it. Two worker kills total And I bet one of them was like a scouting worker or something like that This has just been, it's actually been unbelievable so far This has just been a really weird game This I like. This is a good move See? Imagine these, one of these was here earlier It would have spotted the disruptor You got a disruptor kill for free That's fantastic That's what you need to do That's what everyone does This is not a new concept that I just made up Everyone knew that we have a salad run by into this base Prol's player thinks this is going to work I have a quick tip there This is not going to work Absolutely not expanding as well Look at this guy, man An actual macro monster I mean, at this point, I think our Terran player is pretty dead He's down 12 workers He's down two upgrades And he also has a significantly worse army. He's still after six minutes, no, seven minutes What is it? Yeah, seven minutes of seeing Colossus has not managed to must drop a Viking force capable of taking out the initial three Colosses, which is, once again, just very, very impressive Just a lot of the things that are happening here, I'm more impressed by than disappointed in a ways Like I don't even quite understand how it's possible That you see someone open up with Colossus and you decide that, you know what, Vikings might just be more of a luxury in this case I'll focus more on building mines Because you do keep building mines, don't you? Despite there being 12 disruptors out already and disruptors being a very solid counter to mines. You've lost 13 mines, you build six more Your planetary gets taken out by Dark Templar You give up on life and start attacking across the map Good move I always liked that Taryn hasn't been capable of fighting the army on their own side of the map for the past three minutes Then when they lose the base, you go like, all right, no, I can It's like no, you still have better chances winning, just setting up that fort base again Yeah, this is actually the correct call going back home here I do like that I appreciate that a lot It's a good call, very good call I also like the mine here. I think a mine next to a planetary when you know the T's are out is almost always going to be a necessity Now, you can lift this You do lift that, which is the correct play Thank the Lord I mean, there's just a gold base You haven't put on any pressure on this Protos since ever, honestly Like, no aggressive rotations, no drops except for the early game It has just been bad, bad, bad And I don't have a feeling it's going to get good anytime soon I mean, Protos has freaking infinite resources at this point, 94 workers It's 3-3 on the way Yeah, 3-3 on the way You also have 2-2, but you lose your third base At this point, you're just behind. And this actually, now here, here I would understand it If you had a maxed army at this point and you were fighting against eight disruptors or nine disruptors, and all the toss does is dance back and forth and shoot purification of us at you And you were to complain about that, I'd say, yeah, I think that is a valid complaint At the high level, at the highest level, disruptors are super annoying to play against It feels like they have no direct counter on the ground The only kind of indirect counter is in the air, which is the Liberator You need very good control as the Terran player while shooting the purification of us takes very, very little to do. You can just shoot a purification over, you can put it even on follow-on units Like, that isn't exactly rocket science, you know? I completely would have agreed with you But instead, what you picked was one moment where James Bond, in disruptor form, moves across the map, shoots his one disruptor shot, and kills 30 supply This is as if you have a plumbing problem in your neighborhood, right? Everything is bad The toilet doesn't flush all that crap And the neighborhood wants to talk to the local government who is, you know, responsible for this terrible plum job, the pipes, whatever, something is wrong And you become the spokesperson for all of these people, your entire neighborhood. Okay, there's a lot riding on this, because these people want to pee again and flush it And the first thing you mention in the meeting is that you can't drink out of the toilet ball anymore because the water is contaminated Like, this is politically very ineffective And it's the same thing that you're doing here This single disruptor moving across the map, killing 30 supply, is not the problem for Terrans against disruptors And every Terran is going to hate you for bringing this up What they dislike is the fact that nine disruptors at the same time can just shoot Protos doesn't have to do any defensive micro There's no energy cost on that either Like, I'm doing the complaint better than you did it. I don't even understand how that is possible As long as there are people like you complaining about not being capable of drinking water out of a toilet ball, I think Protos is going to be safe So not only do I think that you suck, because that I do know for sure, I also would like to thank you from the secret Protos alliance Thank you for keeping up the good fight with Terrans like you We're never going to get nerfed Thanks so much for watching Today's episode of Is it Inba or Do I Suck?

        "text": "Dear Harstam, I am a Zirk noop that plays mostly for fun, but I'm beginning to ask myself, is PVZ really all that fun? Even when I play random, which I do quite a bit, if I'm starting with Protos in a PVZ, I'm always a little more comfortable Granted, there is a high probability that I will lose even SP, but still, dot dot In this replay, my opponent faked a cannon rush, well played honestly, but I did not realize that he was not committing There was even a gateway! I was prepared for a proxy robo I reacted quite seriously, cancelled my natural, get gas to prepare the reveragers that would eventually help me against his cannonwall. After I crush his outpost in my natural, I almost immediately realized he was going for Stargate and a hidden expansion I tried to do my best with the units that I had and with some ravagers, three queens and anidas, I attacked his main base, only to be welcomed by a bloody carrier And a weird emoji Like, dot, dot, dot, man, sure, dot, dot, dot No problem, dot, dot Here I am with four Ravager and three queens, aka where I put all my money in this game And I can't even transfuse against this interstellar galactic carrier of destruction I'm sure you will think a lot about what this said in this case. I can picture your body, bend over your desk while your hands hold your head, trying to imagine a world where this kind of game makes sense But dot dot dot, I know that even the captain will admit that this game awful and this race, your race, is Inba The last paragraph there almost read like a little bit of fan fiction, and I'm not down for that I'm glad it ended in a more normal imbalance complaint form way Our complainie this time around is called Grand Master, not Grandmaster, Grandmaster, who is a Zirk player on the diamond level 3,400 MMR on the European server And the question is, is Protos imbalanced or does the Grand Mister suck? And we're here to find out. And just like that, we find ourselves in the game on tropical sacrifice between Grand and Mr here in the top right And in the bottom left, I know nothing with a capital G and a capital I So really, you know, bringing it home, driving home the fact that he is completely knowing nothing in this game We have a pool first coming out But, well, excuse me Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa This is not just a pool first, ladies and gentlemen This is not your average 16 or 17 pool This is an overlord into 14 pool This is such a rare build that we almost never see and this build, it's actually pretty tricky to play against. It comes at a weird timing and it's difficult for TOS to respond too often because the links are so darn fast Now, this isn't really a weird fake cannon rush because I see a forge here Second probe also being sent out And it's a pool first Now, the pool first is, I don't want to say a blind counter, but it really is just a blind counter to the cannon rush The earlier the pool, the better it is So the fact that this is a 14 pool rather than just a 16 pool makes it even better He's going to scout the first pilot immediately as well. So literally all Grand Mister needs to do at this point is pool five workers, built six links or three sets of links, and automatically win the game This makes very little sense The hatch cancel here Like, I almost feel like this is complaining about not being capable of tying your own shoelaces It's like, oh, tying my shoelaces is too hard, while wearing Velcro shoes Because Velcro is invented for idiots that don't know how to tie their shoes And the 14 pool is invented for idiots who don't know how to counter cannon rush with a regular hatch first, or even with a 16 pool But this is insanely free On top of that, look at this Now, this is even different. This cannon rush is similar to Crocs that's how easy it is to slide into them This is like failing to put on crooks because these cannons aren't even being walled in An actual drone pool by itself would have killed this cannon rush Like completely would have destroyed it Four drones can attack this cannon, maybe even five drones and like nine drones can attack this cannon They're not being walled in, and if they were being walled in with this pylon, they wouldn't be capable of shooting the hatchery This is literally the worst cannon rush that I've seen in my life. you played a legitimate blind counter and you decided to cancel your hatchery and to build a spine crawler in case the cannons start crawling forward Now, there is a theory that I have here back in the very alpha of StarCraft 2 there was a unit called, or a building called the Face Cannon And the face cannon could actually walk So if you were getting cannon rushed, the cannons could walk to a different position as long as they were within a pylon field So I guess Grandmister watched this video of the face cannon I was like, ooh, that sounds dangerous Let me just build a spine against, you know, in case the cannon start walking up my ramp for whatever reason. But otherwise, this spine is completely idiotic And of course, the Roach Ward Like, okay, I'm This entire response makes no sense, and I'm going to go over it Just step by step once more, okay? So let's just call out every mistake as a I see it First mistake here is canceling this hatchery So we built the hatchery here We cancel it That's the first mistake Should have been a drone pool But still not the end of the world What you could have done is just straight up build a bunch of links Pull like two or three drones to deny the initial cannons And then you just rebuild the hatchery You know, not all hope is lost yet Okay. So that's the first mistake that we're seeing here Then the second mistake is taking the gas and building the spine crawler In no word, Is the spine crawler necessary at this timing? Literally in no world Your opponent opened up with a forge first You are aware of that because you just saw the stupid cannons What is he going to do with the cannons that you need the crawler? Are you afraid of the probe walking up, starting a pylon here and then finishing cannons before your links pop out? No, that's impossible because your pool has finished already Your links could already be starting This crawler does nothing. If you want to go for a roach response, you would want the roaches to be out as fast as possible. and does this drone that just built a spine crawler should have built a freaking roach warren and you should be getting a second gas already but you're doing none of that because you have no clue on how to respond to anything whatsoever you could be handed the winning lottery ticket and you would eat it and then complain that you have nothing to eat for dinner it's like well if you would have handed in the lottery ticket maybe you would have gotten some cash this is legitimately the dumbest response with the opener that you had I don't think you could have invented anything worse than what I'm currently seeing I actually think you would need to try very hard. You literally, every single decision, like if there was a decision tree, you always took the wrong branch, basically It's absolutely insane Absolutely insane Also, this is What did you say about this cannon rush? In this replay, my opponent faked a cannon rush, but I did not realize that he was not committing There was even a gateway Yes, there was a gateway because he was committing This was not a fake cannon rush This was a real cannon rush He built two cannons and two pylons and a gateway When is it a real cannerous? What is this gatekeeping of cannon rushing? Unless there's seven cannons, it's not a real cannon rush. Like, holy crap, you're the guy in elementary school that had a crush on a girl that has had a boyfriend for five years already You're like, oh, it's not a real relationship They've only held hands 50 times and needs to be 85 times They haven't even kissed each other's foreheads yet I still have a chance It's like, bro, you're massively coping at this point. this is a real cannon rush and we cannot there's two cannons like and he rushed them out it's literally the definition has been met I don't understand how you can like when is it a cannon rush five cannons in your main base like I just don't understand it like he achieved his goal of canceling your natural now our Protos player is expanding to I don't even know like the seventh base I don't even know why you would do this but you know I don't even mind it Because everything that I know nothing does is just inherently better than what you do Because everything you do is literally the worst thing that I have ever seen So yes, I like this. But just compared to what you are doing. You're the friend that people take when going out just to look good, you know? It's like the bad friend for comparison. Like everyone would want your replays as well So, you know, they can watch their own replays, then they watch your own replays. I was, yeah, I'm not that bad I'm pretty okay at StarCraft Compared to Grandmaster. Man, make okay decisions every now and again Sure, I lost third lings into a cannon, but didn't cancel my hatch with a pool first. Against the cannon rush That apparently also was a fake at the same time All right Let's continue this game. Man, we're only three minutes in, and my blood pressure is already rising too rapidly again Because of people like you, I now at all times have a doctor on standby He's in the other room, and I'm being monitored at all times I get bonus points if I act like I care You know, my block treasure goes too high He comes in, I have to pause the recording, and then we go again It's absolutely awful These replays really get me going Cannon battery Kind of like that I like that you're actually taking these out without walking into the cannons You know, you're doing this from a distance That is a very responsible thing to do. I would have preferred if you started with the cannon so you could have expanded quicker Now instead you went for a gateway and a pilot first, but it is still kind of okay You're hitting them at the same time, which is also good This I actually kind of liked I liked this little interaction that you just went for, I liked Now, you just invented, or sorry, invented, you invested a buttload of resources into those ravagers So the only normal thing to do right now would be to move across the map ASAP And as you've stated in your imbalance complaint form, after clearing my natural, actually let me find the exact wording, I reacted quite seriously and cancelled my natural No, that wasn't it. After I crush his outpost in my natural, I almost immediately realized he was going for Stargate and a hidden expansion Alright, let's see how fast almost immediately is So he crushed this outpost at 4 45 When does our friend realize that there is a proxy expansion and a Stargate? So far, he's not aware of the Stargate yet So far, he's not aware of the Stargate yet of the expansion either Or maybe right now he's aware because he scouts this This is a very weird response to knowing that there is a proxy expansion though, isn't there? Oh, okay, I think now he realized, or he thinks that there might be something like a hidden expansion So we said 445. That's a solid 25 seconds, an almost immediate realization Now, that starts, you know, all of a sudden things start making a lot more sense If 25 seconds is a lightning fast response, I'm really glad that you're not allowed a driver's license because you're going to be a true danger in traffic Okay, now you truly figured it out You were already building a NIDIS network, though And let's take a look at the info that Grand Minister has gotten so far He's seen a Stargate here He's seen a Stargate over here He's seen a fleet beacon, a cannon and a battery in this base, and he's seen a cannon in this base So naturally, the main priority here should be getting anti-air. Right? No matter what it is you do with your NIDIS, you want to get anti-air out In my mind, do you want to attack this base or do you want to go to the main? I'm not even entirely sure, honestly You know that? I don't actually know for sure what the correct call is here Like, do you go Dross down the Nitis over here It's very far back Ravitors moving forward And we have three queens But one queen is in the natural, defending this empty base Smart 20 workers against 43, but obviously the priority here is going to be defending this hatchery and this spore crawler with the queen Now, we need to build another NIDIS over here so we can continue transfusing. We obviously need to get all of our queens into the Nidus as well, so we're actually helping out I love the prioritization here Look at this This is the brilliant thinking that I'm lacking in my life It's like, okay, what do we have here? I'm rushing my opponent with about seven units at the seven minute mark That's a single unit per minute, by the way But let's not get hung up on that You see a cybercore, it's like, ooh, that might be researching plus one armor or plus one air weapons That is a real danger The carrier, however, a unit that can actually shoot and defend Neh Is that really that important? Well, probably not Let's leave that for another time. I actually believe if all of these ravagers would have immediately focused on the Stargate, he missed Biles? How do I zoom this in? Then I can see it I can't The edge of the map is ruining it But he misses all four Biles here Look at this This is a static structure He just clicked next to it Maybe it's like a dog or something that is barking at him or hitting his leg the entire time He plays in a room with 25 Cats is also possible We don't know We don't know the circumstances that Grand Mr is currently playing on It is unfair of me to judge my opponent. I absolutely hate that these Reveyor Bowls managed to hit a flying target, but couldn't manage to hit a static structure here Did manage to kill it, though Kill the Voidre That was good Now also almost get this carrier You know, I looked at this army and thought to myself, there's two queens here, despite there being, there were five queens on the map earlier. There's only two queens there, and that's only two anti-air units but in reality at this level I guess Revengers count as anti-air because no one moves their air units out quick enough so it almost worked I truly believe that if another NIDIS would have been built here and a spore crawler gets added like you send two drones in and you send all five queens which can transfuse I actually believe that Grand Mister with this completely terrible build by the way would have probably been capable of at least taking out this base now does the game end there probably not because we have an expansion going up on the top side of the map I'm not even quite sure why that is happening. I don't even see the purpose of it Like, what are you hiding? Like, the fact that you have no eco anywhere, it just makes absolutely no sense whatsoever Why is everyone expanding like an idiot in this game? I just don't understand it Was it a spire? Okay, spire going up So the follow-up here is going to be corruptors, which honestly kind of makes sense, but also you're down 20 workers by the time he started getting into corruptors Usually the game is pretty over at that point Did he really tech into his pyre while mid-asing with two queens? Yeah, it's fantastic The weirdest thing about this entire game, in my mind, is that Grandmister's macro hasn't been that bad. Like his money has been kept pretty low the entire way through, which kind of pisses me off in a way, because it shows that his mechanics are somewhat okay And usually when people ask me, like, hey, Kevin, how do I improve? I'm hard stuck in plat I'm like, I'll just practice your mechanics and you're getting out But if this is the level of decisions that we're dealing with, I don't even think that mechanics will help that much Like, this guy could have Cyril's hands at this point and he'd be expanding with his natural to the seventh base or this isn't even his own seven base. Like, why are you expanding towards the living spaces of the scantipede? This is an endangered species, by the way You're not just allowed to build there Cirque players have absolutely no respect for the environment It's pathetic 64 supply to 100 Like our Protos player is winning so hard When I was already building Tempest We love to see it A couple more queens Eight queens coming out right now Two spores here in this base Honestly, not a bad of a plan because what are these guys doing? Actually, I want to take a look You know, I take a dive in the first person view here of Grand Master What happens in the brain of a genius? That is truly what I want to know. Did you just click the scantipete? I want to see that again I really do want to see that again Huh? Huh? I saw him I saw him click it One Two Three He clicks He clicks the scantepete He's just insanely imprecise This is how your drone is over here To be sure, they do look a little similar This is why he missed the Stargate as well He's just off by like, what is this? Like five centimeters? Six centimeters How was it even possible? Did he try to I really want to know Can we see inputs in the game? I want to know if he pressed the hotkeys for build hatchery while selecting the scantipede. How long did it take him to realize that it was the wrong one? Is he building an extract? Where's he going? They just send the drone to the top What? In what world does this make any sense whatsoever? What are these doing? What in the world is actually happening in this game? What is this move? He's defending this base The entire point of a proxy hatch is that you pretend like it doesn't exist You can't just go there to try and defend it That's not allowed That's the entire opposite of what's allowed This entire game is entire game is legitimately ridiculous What is this? Ah If he builds at his opponent's natural, I'm actually going to lose my brain. And I don't actually think I have that many brain cells left, so there's not a whole lot to lose anymore, but this is painful, no? This is actually painful to watch One one upgrade I mean, this game is completely over, that's for sure I thought you think you can right click down this mothership, can you? Oh, nice transfuses Actually, transfused, controls his unit? This is pissing me off so much He controls his unit, has different control groups, has been macroing decently well this entire game It's just his decisions are so garbage I don't even understand how it's possible I really did not believe that this was possible with this level of mechanics to make this many mistakes. He's averaging double the APM of his opponent Now if you click the wrong button fast a lot, apparently that's not good enough It really isn't 80 nice apply against 131 And then he ends up losing the game, I guess What's this? How many years do we actually have? 16 corruptors We'll actually get the mothership here, by the way Very nice A couple more transfuses Come on Come on Oh, Gigi Okay, yeah I mean, the game was very over I don't even really know what he's complaining about Like, he didn't complain about anything specific I He thought the cannon rush was fake, so he can't complain about about the cannon rush. It's like, because then you admit being beaten by an illusion, which makes no sense at all But I think personally that the cannon rush is what killed him He was so far behind effort He opened up with a 14 pool, cutting a lot of workers already Then he built a spine crawler for no reason, waited like five minutes to secure his natural, that the worst NIDIS network all in that I've seen in my entire life But his macro during it actually wasn't even that bad It's just his brain doesn't seem to work at all But I don't even know what he thinks is in balance. Is it in balance that seven minutes in, Protos had a single carrier? Like, is that really what we're complaining about? Or, like, I honestly just don't really see it I don't understand what he's complaining about I don't want to, he sucked as well His decisions were really bad, but there was no real complaint So I'm going to do this First of all, you suck because you played awful with garbage decision making Just terrible everything, but pretty decent mechanics And second, I'm going to declare this imbalance complaint form invalid as well because there was no complaint on it Next time, complain about something specific Most of the time I can at least figure out what people are complaining about. But, I mean, it was one carrier at seven minutes That doesn't seem very complaint worthy The cannon rush, according to Grandmaster himself, was a fake? Like, what was the problem here? Was it just that Protos is too comfortable or too easy? I don't know Maybe we'll figure it out If you're Grandmister, please let me know in the comments what you think was imbalanced If you're not Grandmister, also let me know in the comments what you thought Grandmister thought was imbalanced, because I simply just do not know That's going to be it for me today Thanks all so much for watching I hope you to enjoy this episode of IOTIS If you did, don't forget the like, but subscribe to the channel.

        "text": "Dear Hosterm, Protos is completely broken and as a Terran can never win Protos in a macro game I was trading efficiently in the whole game, doing great in multitasking, expanding and macroing rapidly in the behind And perfect micro on those disruptors in the engagement However, Protos' armies and units were just too good to beat DT's were imba They can do lots of damage and blink away with no cost In this game he just warped DTs to defend every attack by me, and being a Terran must focus on each field and save orbital energy to counter- aim of DTs Moreover, Protos army with disruptors in the Super Battery were unbeatable to Terran. It feels like my 200 supply armies were no threat to him, so that his production tap were only probes and disruptors Every time I took down his base, he just made another base, and I can't do anything about it, because my drops and harass can easily be held by warping DTs and super battery Even if I made a perfect fight and killed his main valued army and pushback, he just brainlessly warped lots DTs to run by while disruptors standing in Super Battery and I can't do anything about him I admitted that the opponent was good because his MMR was higher than me, and maybe I made some mistakes. However, the DTs and disruptors were too good and took almost no skill compared to Taryn Dear Captain, can you really tell me? Is it I Mba? Or do I suck? Eternity, Ray Sterran, League, Grand Master, 5,700 MMR on the Korean server Usually when I look at Replace in an IOTIS, I'm kind of nice still You know, I look at it and I'll cut these players some slack But with you, my friend, I'm going to do this This is a bar This is the regular IOTUS level But because you're a Korean, I'm going to raise it a little bit bit and because you're Grand Master, I'm going to raise it so much that right now it's not even in the frame anymore. So every single mistake that you're going to make is going to get called out Every little tiny detail that you get wrong in the first five minutes, I'm going to relentlessly slaughter you over it And every movement error afterwards, every micro mistake afterwards, my friend, you're going to be in some major trouble I'm going to be doing the same thing for this Protos player, of course, because he's also a grandmaster If this Protos makes any nonsensical place, I won't hesitate to call it out I won't hesitate to say, this is garbage, you deserve to win, Protos is imbalanced Okay? I'm very serious about this. Disruptors and DTs, these units are very difficult to play against, and often Terran players feel like they're easier to use than they are to counter Honestly, that's the case with almost everything in the game If you think about the widow mines, easier to use than to counter Benchies easier to use than the counter Most all-ins easier to use than to counter Most of the time, aggressive things are just easier to use than they are to counter, which is why most people prefer having map control and attacking, because it requires slightly less skill People that All-In, usually at the start of any expansion, were the ones that were most successful as well The bar that I just raised was laying on my cable. So I wasn't dancing on my chair I was just trying to get the cable trying to get the cable from under the bar This is what happens when you make mediocre jokes at the start of an episode It's going to annoy you for the rest of the episode Okay, what do we have here? We have a scout heading towards the other side of the map We have an interesting nexus timing We have a later core because of that, I guess This is just kind of an in-between core It probably was nexus into core here We see a bunker being built I kind of do like that I think that is good against the fast nexus This Reaper is out. about on the map already as well. It's going to go across the map and the Marine gets built behind it. Factory. A little bit delayed compared to what it usually is because the Bunker is here so you don't quite have enough minerals, but I can kind of live with it. First two shots were on the Nexus. Not brilliant, but also really not that bad. Did we get a scout? I actually got a scout on the Stargate. That is huge. Fantastic first move. You could say, hey, you're building a Bunker in the natural. Why didn't you just initially go into the natural? But I don't actually mind it that much. I actually kind of like this. I think this was a fairly good call. getting that scout because the product was most likely was afraid of the bunker Good stuff, good stuff indeed Triple Cc behind this as well Now that is something I really do like on top of it That is actually quite cool Then you can just play TechLab here straight away into Cyclone You can maybe even deny scouting with that You put like the cyclone over here or on the very edge And then the third CC doesn't even get spotted Actually beautiful Probably one of the best openers possible here for our, our red tarrant player called Eternity Well, in game they're both called barcode, but we know he's called Eternity Even gets to keep the. What? What? What was that? I'm not sure if this bunker would have survived without the grenade, but the grenade definitely didn't help If you hit the grenade on the stalkers, they don't actually get the shooting again Look at this This I don't want the money back I think the bunker would have died anyway, but it would have been close That was definitely an error though That was definitely an error Another error I'm seeing here is this Helion First of all, this Helion is way too late What happened here? What happened here in my absence, my friends? Let's not forget that I mentioned that the factory was already a little bit later than usual by about four or five seconds. Usually it would finish like 257, 256 but this time it finishes at 301 and despite scouting the tech of the opponent already and keeping the Reaper alive we still see a helion here and the helion just doesn't make a whole lot of sense we'll get into that but first of all I also believe that the helion actually was delayed yeah 302 or 301 the factory finished and we're not seeing a single unit being produced until 314 50 okay 312 or 3 3 3 3 3 So that is 10 second delay on a factory unit That is absolute garbage That is really, really bad I understand you were busy with this SCV, but getting a factory unit out would always have priority. Now let's criticize the unit that you pick Rather than building a Helion, this obviously should have been a Tech Lab For the simple reason that you have already scouted what Tech your opponent is going for, you probably can already figure out their follow-up as well by the fact that you see two stalkers and not adept Most likely it's going to be Oracle into Blink If you see someone open up with two stalkers and a Stargate, 90% of the time that's going to be it But even if you're not sure, you still have the Reaper alive so you can use that to scout On top of that, you're playing a fast triple-CC. And fast triple-CC builds don't allow you to respond very much to what you are seeing It is not like you can decide, okay, I want to build a mine and go for a mine drop It's impossible because you are not building a star port You need to build barracks behind this anyway That is how triple-CC build orders work So instead of rushing out a helion over here, you should be getting a cyclone A cyclone helps in the defense against an Oracle or against the Phoenix and can deny the Oracle or the Phoenix from seeing the third base. If you deny vision on the third base, your opponent might be forced to cut probes because they believe something bad is about to happen like a one-one-one push Instead of that, now because of the initial five-second delay and the 10 second delay because you forgot to build a factory on top of that building a helene which takes 21 seconds I don't actually think your cyclone is going to be in time for an Oracle which actually would be kind of a travesty It actually is going to be quite a travesty You only have four Marines and they can be positioned in the correct location Now you're building a second barracks anyway because that's literally the only thing you can do from this builder anyway. It's not like you can throw down a star port here It would just delay everything way too much, would delay your follow-out move-out with Stim and with Combat Shield Your opponent is immediately going to see the fact that there's a 30C, sees that there's a factory here with a TACLAB and it's like, hey, this is fun I can just go in Now, this still wouldn't have been so bad if you would have immediately started your Helion and the TECLAB afterwards, but because you were 10 seconds delayed, your opponent is going to get even more kills here on this Oracle than he ever should have gotten in the first place This Oracle should have been stopped at the edge. Shouldn't have been allowed to see this freaking command center, but instead, due to your massive failure, now the Protos player gets to expand for free to a third base, kills five workers for no reason whatsoever Yeah, it was five I was afraid there might have been an adept, but it was a stalker opener, never mind And it's just going to go straight up into Blink, not having to worry about building any phoenixes for potential meta-fax or getting any pylon spread or unit spread around the map for any attacks So basically you gave away all the info that the toss needed to make informed decisions for the next basically two and a half, three minutes. And on top of that, you also lost five workers This is a completely terrible start Losing five workers just feels really, really bad, especially if you're playing a triple-CC opener That basically is your eco advantage from that triple-cc, you know, down the drain Well, the opponent right now, look at this Forge being thrown down We see just infinite probes being produced as well Honestly, Protos at this point could probably go into a fort-based straightaway off of three gateways I don't think he's going to end up doing this, but I would allow it And the reason why I would allow it is because he's going to have good map control, good map vision with the blink, with the Oracle. Yeah, we're getting a second force I really, really like this call I think that is honestly a perfect call You could even throw down a robotics facility during this You could play something like double-forged, Robo Facility, Ford Base, straight into Colossus from this point, and there's literally there's not nothing you could do about it, but there's almost nothing you could do about What in the world is this follow-up? Two more barracks before Starport Three tanks? Like, what actually is this? This is the type of build order that when Blizzard released the game in 2010, already wasn't viable anymore. They figured out, the developers figured out in the pre-Alpha that if you want to play bio, that after three barracks, you want to get some freaking Metafax You're never going to put any pressure on your opponent here None What? Nice one You need Metafax to scare the Protos into, honestly, anything Right now, this Protos player is just producing, workers infinitely, is getting upgrades, is getting tech, six gateways at the same time It's like, oh, what are you going to do? Throwing down a dark shrine I mean, why not? Plenty of time anyway Pure stalker right now This is the most insane investment into the future that I've seen in a PVT game and everything is allowed. There is nothing you can say right now about the greed of your opponent Nothing because he has full information You gave it to him and your follow-up builder is so insanely bad that your Metafax are going to hit the field at like the nine minute mark You're not even building a reactor here for your Starport It's like you're purposefully trying to delay your moveouts because you're afraid of moving out Why's your upgrade so late? What are you getting quickly here? Like what are the goals of this build? You know what I think it is? I think eternity over here just wanted to see the supply rise as quickly as possible It's like, wait a second Barracks are pretty cheap Don't cost any gas. I can Marines out of those and marauders They inflate supply pretty quickly, way faster than these stupid metaphics, which are expensive I think that is actually the plan here So then when he shows this replay to someone like me, you can say, hey, after seven minutes and 50 seconds, I was up 20 supply, despite losing seven workers in the early game But the supply is completely irrelevant if you can't move on the map with it And if you're down in upgrades as well, and you're going to be down in upgrades even further Look at this A fifth base is being started already and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it. Is your entire plan just to sit back, you're building turrets already, three turrets in the main before your first two metaphics are out? It's not like you're going to be caught off guard on the map Because you don't have metaphics, and you can't be on the map yet Like your opponent's two-two is going to almost finish before your first two metaphics even start This is actually the saddest build order that I've seen in my entire life I've been doing Iiotis for, I think like two and a half, three years at this point This takes the cake, because you're supposed to be good at this game. Now, do I have anything to criticize the Protos for? Let's just be, you know, let's be honest here Yes, I do have a lot of things I want to criticize the Tosfer Why is this watchtower not taken? Why is there no pylon in the far left? Why is there no pylon over here? Why don't we have Actually, we have units over here, so I like that Pylon in the far right position as well We have batteries So really the only thing is some vision, is lacking on the top side of the map That's the only thing that I think I would have done different in this entire game so far You have an entire, you have like a list, a scroll. If I were to enroll a scroll with all of your mistakes, we would be busy for a couple of years And it's just the first nine minutes Like, you're not even rushing anything out, which is what makes this even more confusing You're just delaying things Like this fort base at nine minutes after a triple Cc isn't that quick Your upgrades are very slow Your Ghost Academy is slow Your MataVex are late The only thing you have a lot of tanks But even that is not like an insane It's not like you have 15 tanks You have six Like that is a reasonable number of tanks to have You just have nothing Your entire build order is inefficient. Yes, there's high supply numbers, but it sucks Everything you have sucks right now Your opponent is going to finish his 2-2 before your plus-1 armor finishes up You have two METAvex right now on the map That's it You have two Menevacs to heal an army of 52 bio units, 20 marauders and 32 Marines Okay, now you have four maraud No, you have four medevacs But one is already empty because you stint your entire army once to deal with a Zellad and a DT Fantastic Your opponent is so confident in his position that he's getting Shadow Stride and DTs before your first moveout Before your first move out He's on 94 workers and nothing in this game. could have stopped him from it because your builder sucked so hard Your execution of this potentially powerful triple cc opener was so bad that your opponent is now maxed out in everything He's tacking into fleet beacon and it's the correct call It's not too fast It is perfectly timed Once again, the only thing I kind of want to actually kind of want to insult this TOSFRA is why aren't you in position to stop this move out? Why is there no run by ready when this move out is happening? Surely five six Zell is should be heading in towards his third base right now Surely the Colossus Army should be in position to stop this move out from happening in the first place. That actually is kind of bad And this fight could, despite all of your failures in the first 10 minutes and 34 seconds, could actually still be kind of okay for you I'd love for these, yep, these tanks to move forward That is good Good call here Although that is a very basic call that you want all your units in the fight You see the Colossus, maybe Viking production would be something that we could consider at this point as well We're really spending these scans rather liberally as well, just kind of throwing them in there How many do we have left? Okay, we have zero scans left at this moment Cool to see, cool to see. You knew the word ETs, yet you just kind of wasted your scans away, like a bit of a prick One one upgrades against two two, but you kill the fifth base So far, your fight has been pretty efficient Took out a base, despite not deserving to take out that base, may I add And after, this is a classic move as well After taking out a base and dealing a blow to your opponent, rather than continuing to push on, you just relax for a little bit in this position Go back home Nice scan forward once more It's like, hey, these DTs are dangerous, but, you know, it would be more dangerous, not knowing at all times what's happening with my opponent. Let me just spend the less of my energy on scanning a position I don't even really want to attack Nice move DTs are still on the map You have a rotation coming in towards the other side Now, please note, okay? please note as an unbiased observer here that all of this aggression is aimed at basis that the opponent is building that are more than what our Terran has So yes, you could say Terran just took out a fifth base or just took out a nexus, but the actual amount of bases is still the same And the income is extremely favorable for the Prodos player here. The Prodos player is investing massively in infrastructure, 12 gateways, three robos, four, Stargates, this guy even has two cybernetic scores, okay? Just two cybernetic scores My man, eternity, just now is adding barracks six, seven, and eight Okay, this is different levels, all right? Different levels A lot more mining has been done already here for our Protos player The amount of investment into stuff is so much bigger Now, once again, this should be a fight that actually, I think it That should be fairly good I was going to say I just want to take a look at the ghost movement here. Paparapa running away from a purification Nova could pick it up with my medevac or I could just keep running away or I could walk them into it as well Poof! Two ghost marauder, two marines, bam, down the train Very cool What did you say in your complaint form about it? Perfect micro on those disruptors in the engagement Perfect micro on those disruptors Wait, on the disruptors Maybe he meant that the Protos had perfect micro, because what the Terran has shown so far is absolutely not perfect micro against the disruptors Okay, move forward Another great scan over here Now let's take a look at the scan energy One, two, three No scans available over here for my good friend Eternity. Uses it to scan a position I love to see it It's like, ah, maybe he forgot about the fact that DTs exist There's no ghost in the army anymore either after that last maneuver, so can't even EMP anymore This tank position honestly is quite dangerous for the Protos Like I would not be willing to bet that the TOS necessarily wins an incoming engagement here Like this is honestly quite scary This army shaving off towards the top side Do I like that? Do I like this move? I guess the Protos can't engage into the army anyways You're just taking out a base for free Yeah, I like the move Good, good job, I guess I liked it Oh, get another scan over here. Beautiful stuff Nice Meanwhile, this DT is still slamming away at your tanks Oh, no, no scans available anymore God, I'm glad I scanned this army for the fifth time to make sure it's still only Colossian disruptors That is just great to see Big drop in the main base Man, I sure do hope that the opponent doesn't have any DTs here But it's insane This is like, imagine you're stuck on a deserted island and you have three road flares and you use two of them to shoot at a mosquito nest And then the other one doesn't work by the time a ship comes by. It's like, well, can you really blame that one flare for not working anymore by the time the ship comes by after you shot two at mosquito nest? First of all, why would you use flares to shoot at mosquito nest? Is that even a fact? Actually, it probably would be a fact of it Probably burned a nest real nice And then again, is that really the priority when you're on a deserted island and only have three flares? It's also a fantastic move This is cutting off the head of the snake while the rest of the snake is eating you And there's five heads of the snake The snake can just regrow a head Like you can literally just build a new Dark shrine. My man just lost like 25 supply sniping a pretty cheap building. Great stuff. I do like this re-drop though. If there's invisible units slashing your bio, perhaps the better call is to actually just pick them up and fly to a different base or wait until you have a scan available. Pick them up and then drop them once you have a scan available. Like the fact that you're building more Command Centers, I think that is a good call. You need Orbital Commands for scans. You also need to be a little bit less, you know, loose with using your scans. I mean, this was a single DT. There was an EMP available there as well. Probably could have just EMPed that DT rather than going for the EMP on these two stalkers No matter how much you hate these two stalkers, surely Oh, nice Another scan forward. and a scan for a single d t should just waste two scans to kill a single d t the type of stuff i love to see and now we'll get into a situation where these two dTs yep there's nothing to scan them anymore and you leave another 15 supply behind god this is this is insane this is like seeing a man walk into the same wall five times and complain about the position of the wall yes the wall might not be in the most perfect perfect location because you keep walking into it but maybe you should also just walk around the wall rather than try to go through it because that always obviously isn't working Hey, more DTs, cleaning up my drops. What a surprise Are building more command center, so it should get more scans at least These orbitals are becoming pretty ready But with these last few moves, you know what you did? You gave up the one tool that you actually had in this game And that was map control Your army isn't necessarily better You have almost no Vikings against the Colossi Tempest army You have a lot of tanks, which aren't so brilliant You don't have too many marauders you're not even maxed right now, but you did have map control for a very long time, and that didn't allow the Protos to move out, especially given his very high work account. The most important thing you could have kept doing is multitasking, which you actually were doing a good job splitting off armies into different groups You are not doing a good job managing those groups Not at all, actually You lost everything to DT war pins every single time Fool me one, shame on me, fool me twice, shame on you Fool me three times Shame on me Fool me four times Shame on me Fool me five times Shame on me Fool me six times Shame on me Ful me seven times Shame on me Fee eight times Shame on me Fee me nine times Shame on me. There's just a lot of shame on you right now because you just keep getting fooled again and again and again and again and again And it's a little bit sad to see Also, just now you're starting three to be 15 minutes into the game Just kind of want to talk about it Nice scan Great one Just absolutely love it After having a massive scarcity of scans this entire game Okay, this scan, definitely good I like it Initial good scan Beautiful stuff EMP, bam, hitting that single starter Huge play Can we get another scan? Oh, wait, that was still the first scan? No, you just scanned again, no? The exact same spot Am I an idiot? I think I am an idiot. That was just, man, scans last forever How can you ever complain about scans? See how quickly I switched that? I made a mistake that should have made me look stupid but now instead I'm complaining about Taryn imbalance God I'm so quick at this Maybe he'll make another stupid scan in the future Yep My man Eternity never disappoints Almost made myself look bad But Eternity No one can look bad when you're around You're the ultimate distraction Did you just poop yourself? No problem Eternity pooped himself twice in a row And wet himself as well Beautiful Absolutely beautiful Actually, did manage to take out this Another good scan here God, I love this so much. Let's hope our opponent doesn't warp in DTs again to take out our entire army Because that would really set up Wait, where's this scan? I want to see it I heard a scan happen Here Is this really an essential scan? When we have one scan remaining Your one scan is being used, where you're a little Liberator is harassing Surely a liberator with 36 HP is not going to be the main priority When you have a massive army that's going to be stuck into a corner and perhaps another warpin of 3DTs will clear your entire army Fool me 10 times Shame on you, eternity We should have like a shame on you meter Like a fool me five times. And they're ping-ing-ding-ing, count it all the way up into the sky Ship weapons level 2 on the way I do like that Plus 3 armor finishing up as fast as plus 2 air weapons for the Protos We have a base over here as well Command center upgrade complete Probably would like a second star port here too Do we have that already? Yeah we do Okay nice I'd like some Viking production against these tempest I'd like some Viking production against these Colossus I'd like some ghost against the rest of the army Oh single DT look at this bad boy Oh my god. I can't believe that the Prolop player is more effective at killing his own DTs than Eternity has been at killing these DTs the entire game This has been a very disappointing one so far I just have to admit it This is actually kind of funny to me because despite all of that, despite everything being cleaned up by invisible units, the resource lost is still in favor of the Terran down in upgrades the entire game, worse tech the entire game as well There's still no one answer for the tempest, no real answer for basically anything in the entire army, the entire game, and invisible units never being spotted, and thus probably contributing to about 5K of the resources lost on the Terran side. Despite all of that, Terran has still been training efficiently And it's not because of the Micro either Let's not trick ourselves here, okay? Let's not trick This actually was good control Oh, that was nice control That was bad purification of a Micro Here, the Terran out-controlled the opponent a little bit until he moved into those last two purification novas That was a little bit unfortunate The timing of when I said the Terran out micro, the Protos, and then we all looked at the supply in all that the Protos is winning Is that imbalanced? Yeah Not really Shouldn't stand on the ramp and there's still two purification novas available Resources lost, still in favor of our Terran player, of course. Massive Zadad by heading up towards the top side You absolutely love to see it Good moves out of the toss Now distracting away from an area Taryn F2ing into this position, making sure that it's not going to happen again, and then you can move forward once again with this army I love that this base is still alive It isn't mining You know what's actually kind of interesting? As right now, we're really just one good fight away from equalizing the game Despite the insane eco that Tos had the entire time, the fights weren't good enough for Prodos They really weren't Isn't that interesting Isn't that interesting? Oh, Purification Nova is gonna hit A single Marine. I guess these are the Purification Nova batteries that the Terran was talking about The disruptor batteries, but his army also isn't really that large Don't think even without the super battery, I don't think you can really break this This is a better move anyway This isn't potentially a nice flank We'll have to wait and see what happens with the purification novas flank Nah, yeah, I can live with this This is nice This is a good move You always judge moves after they happened, you know? It looked like a nice flank, but if he then walks into five disruptor shots, all of a sudden is less of a nice flank This is actually a good flank I really do appreciate that. And now the last money of the protests has been spent into a distraction technique Waste format? What is this? How many We have no scans available And we blindly scan two locations adjacent to each other Explain it to me Explain it to me If you can explain it to me, please do in the comments Terran players Just tell me, I'm so curious because this doesn't make any sense for me The entire game these guys have been getting on your nerves That's good EMP That was a nice EMP Now you can continue pushing this location if there wasn't a rum This pro is playing quite well I really like the movement of this protels actually. Yes, it's a little bit risky and it's a little bit riding your face, but I honestly think this toss is quite good I want all the MMR of this toss is I think it's probably like 6K, 6 1 It wouldn't surprise me if this is a GSL protos This guy is playing quite, eh, maybe a bit too low for a GSL proto, but good player Good player I like that Good split off on the army That was a terrible move by the ProDos Now, if you had a scan available here These all would have died If you had a Oh, no There was no scan available Maybe there was no scan available. You know why there was no scan available? Because you scanned this area twice You could have killed seven DTs there for free You actually could have But instead, you killed none because you wasted your scans Like a wasteful little baby Meam, me, me, me No vision Nice one Where are we scanning? Where do we say? I just don't understand it It's like he has like a roulette wheel that he spins every time he needs to scan It's like what other user's location can I scan today? Let me scan the Ford base that has been mining since minute seven or minute six That probably is mined out to make sure there are still mineral patches there. Like what is the point? What is this information going to give you? Please tell me What does this information give you? What decision are you going to make based on this? Now, rather than not dying against the DTs, you're going to aim off across the map and kill this base? No, there's easier bases to pick off on the right side, which you haven't dropped in a while, by the way, Mr Multitask When's the last time we've seen any real multitask? We've seen some army splits with no attacks coming out of you None of these bases are actually being defended None of them There's no cannons This base doesn't even have a pylon This one at least is a pylon. This one is free for you If you would have scanned this, you know pylon, probably would have dropped there Like, oh, no DTs That could be good Lift it? No, don't lift it You know why he didn't lift it here? Because he's slow That's why There's no other reason Loses the planetary at the same time as well Curification of us start hitting 20 Excuse me 92 supply against 86 The problem is that the income is extremely bad, that we have currently a single scan available, that's it, a single scan, and there's DTs There's only two orbitals, so scans aren't coming back quick, and there's like seven bases that are mining from the ProDos Resources lost? Still in favor of the Terran. God, I love it when, you know, there's certain consistencies in life Eternity will use scans on useless crap, Terran players will complain about everything that exist And I can't remember where my joke was heading Oh, and Taryn trades efficiently against ProDos in the late game, despite Terran's always complaining about the late game God, I hate it when I forget my punchline Such a great setup Hmm, absolutely the best, I guess Four Liberators, what are you doing here, buddy? Move word, nice, quick scan Great scan Love to see it Hitting absolutely nothing When's he gonna realize that he only has two orbitals and one of them is flying? Oh, this one's gonna have a little one scan Look at these DTs. If my man barcode ProDs would be aware of the fact that eternity is completely devoid of any scans right now, this game would be so much better Just send a single DT in every single time Oh no, there goes one of your two orbitals Two scans available That's it Two scans for the rest of the game Maybe we'll get a third one as well Maybe we'll get a third There's way too many D I thought these were DTs These were pro There's way too many DTs still alive Oh, Dick It's a great scam That's just a brilliant I love it Fool me 15 times Shame on you Hamster, you just make up the other four that I skipped Just add it somewhere random. I don't care He sees his observer and thinks to himself, you know what? I know there's still 90 T's on the map and I know I only have one scan remaining remaining But the real issue right now is that my opponent sees the position of my army No, that's not the real issue Oh my god, these DTs He's actually making this scan seem good I hate it when that happens Now, the Protos should be just standing in a single DT at the time, and this game would be Uber over I will blame the Prodels for that Instead, what we're getting here is a tempest flank from the left, disruptors from the top, and DTs from the bottom but this is almost as good. And now there's no scan available Oh no! And there's observers on top of your army Ah When it rains, it pours, doesn't it? Eternity Oh, when it rains, it pours indeed And when it pours, you get wet And you, my friend, are drowning right now in the water I'm not sure why this orbital is lifted, but that means that no scans are going to be available There's also like nine bases still mining for our barcode Protos player This has been one hell of a game to watch Resources lost? Yes Terran does it again Lower in the resources lost It is What? Hello, Mr Protos? I bet he has rapid fire on purification nova or something like that. You read that on the internet once that it's good Literally shot seven purification novas and killed half a marine That's to be the worst purification nova to kill ratio that I've seen in my life Almost making this game close There we get another good scan Don't want these observers to get away Out of range Nice moves Nice moves Very nice moves Still have 57 army supply, actually A lot of that in Vikings though Yeah, it's game's pretty over This game is pretty over Bang, bang, bang, bang Grification over my car really hasn't been that great this game Gigi At least he taps out Holy crap All right Let's go over that imbalance complaint for him again what they say. I was trading efficiently in the whole game, doing great in multitasking, expanding and macroing rapidly in the behind Now, you were trading efficiently in the whole game That actually is correct I'll give you that You're doing great in multitasking If by doing great in multitasking, you mean that you had more than one group, then yes, you were doing great in multitasking If by meaning doing great in multitasking, you were getting stuff done with your second groups, then no, you weren't doing great in multitasking You said you were expanding and macroing rapidly in the behind, compared to like a silver player or, or I don't quite understand. Is this like your personal record? Because the game that I watched, we saw a ProDos player at like 12 different bases And I think you barely mine from a fifth at some point Like, I'm not sure if we, maybe you send in the wrong replay That's possible Maybe Perfect macro on those disrupt micro on those disruptors in the engagement Well, the Protos didn't micro those disruptors properly, so that definitely isn't the case And you didn't micro your army perfectly against the disruptors So it's doubly not the case Double wrong Protos armies and units were just too good to beat This directly contradicts when you said you were trading efficiently They were too good to beat. You beat the army and the units again and again and again That's why you traded more efficient like literally everything you complain about in the first three lines is either not true or self-contradictory and thus also probably not true well if you contradict yourself you're going to be correct one time you know if you say I trade it efficiently and I trade it inefficiently one of the two is going to be correct unless you trade it evenly in the end but that's not the case taran actually traded better your main complaint seem to be about the DTs that probably has something to do with your scan allocation. If your opponent is on 12 bases and he's been mining from the fourth base for about 12 minutes already, you probably don't want to scan there if you only have one scan remaining Maybe in the future DTs will be less of an issue DTs actually are pretty strong, but they also die quite quick against bio if you see them They're good when there's no bio around They're bad when there's bio around You manage to make DTs look good when there is bio around That is an accomplishment by itself and I'll congratulate you on that What I'll also congratulate you on is getting the suck award because you, my friend, sucked massively in this game The Protoss completely outplayed you. Way more bases, way better macro, great runbys Your fights were quite okay, but that was about it You, my friend, suck And that is the reality of things All right If you believe that I am wrong and our Terran player didn't suck, be sure to let me know in the comments I love reading wrong opinions all the time Yeah, smash the like If you believe that you have a replay where ProDLS really was imbalanced, or Zirk really was in balance, or Terran perhaps, is really imbalanced Sure to put it in the Google forms down below, and I'll see all of you next time for a new one Thanks so much for watching, and bye-bye."

        "text": "Hello, Mr Captain Lurkers are insanely broken I was dominating the game since the start, but immediately when Lurkers came out on the field, the game was over I could not attack him anymore and would eventually die Lots of people say that Ghosts and Liberators counter Lurkers, but to me it feels like that's only true if you are Maru I do recognize that I had a really late third due to starting out with a two-base all-in, and my macro was a bit sloppy at times Still, I think the advantage in the early game should have been enough to win the game No other unit would have kept him alive and in the game to make him win. So please tell me, are lurkers broken, or do I just really suck? Name Lujolis, race, Terran in the Grand Master League on Europe And the question here is, are lurkers broken or do I just really suck? And we're here to find out All righty then, friends, here we go a game on Cosmic Sapphire between Luolice and a barcode Zirk player on the Grandmaster level on Europe Now, it's always interesting to see these Grandmaster Square off This got scouted that it was a hatchery first Kind of a standard opening It is single, no Double Marine, into reactor, into factory Not completely aware of this build order Usually if you open up a Marine and then a second Marine, you first build a factory. rather than first building the reactor, but I'm not even going to complain about it You know what? This is just an alternative build order, and just because I haven't seen it before doesn't mean it is as good as the other build orders There are just no professional terran players that play this specific build And there's probably no good reason for this Professional terran players are just dumb And Louis has figured out the early game here Building a bunker, there's also one of these things you don't really see that often, unless you go for a complete no scout maybe with CC first, I don't actually think it's common at all to have a bunker, and especially not in a position like this. It's always going to be in a more defensive position Right now, this bunker is completely isolated If roaches, if links, if honestly, if anything shows up, the bunker gets surrounded You won't be in time to repair Even if you are in time to repair, it's such a far walk that most of the time the bunker is going to be half killed already your reinforcements are going to be delayed in helping the bunker Like, the thought of having a bunker is nice, but this is a bit as if you were tasked at securing the president And what you decide to do is you drive him out on a boat into the middle of the ocean with two men of security personnel. They take a picture with the president, and you upload it to your Facebook saying, just chilling with the press It's not a brilliant plan, because where's all the other security? security personnel, well probably on land So in order to save you, they need to come from very far And by that time the president has already been shot by the gangsters that want to kill the president In this hypothetical scenario, it's not my best work I'm sorry for that But yeah, it's the same with the bunker It's just difficult to come to assist it with SCVs, with your extra reinforcements Usually see a bunker like over here Sometimes you even see a bunker on the high ground blindly. If they really believe they're being Roachalind or something like that So what is this opener? This is a MataVec For a hell, okay, this, this, honestly, this feels so much like a hellbat all in, but it isn't But it kind of is, you know, it smells like a hellbet all in Starport is just not doing anything or what? He just gave up on life It's not worth it Wait, double Double taglapse, okay Another interesting move We have a free reactor yet Barracks are being built on the complete opposite end of the base rather than going near the reactor Now, I don't know that much about Taryn, but I do know that you can't just have random add-ons laying around that you'll use later. Like, especially in the early game, the add-on management is one of the most important things It is first of all really rare to see a Starport build its own tech lab if you're going into Raven or Benchy I hope it's not Benchy because your Benchies are going to hit so late It's actually insane how late this Benchie is going to hit if this is a Benchie This should be a Raven or a Fusion Corps No, it's going to be indeed Benchies Now, okay, this entire builder, I was going to actually let the build order go, like, you know, the two Marine into the reactor into the factory, but then you started doing this crap This is actual garbage again. So you add two barracks indicating that you want to hit with a fast stim push, which means that you need quick Metafax For quick Metafx, what do you need? You need a star port that is available with a reactor pumping out medevacs pretty early on in the game Instead, what you're doing here is you build one, wait, where's your medevac? You build one medevac, then you don't do anything with your star port for 25, 30 seconds Then you throw down a tech lab and go into Benchy Cloak takes freaking 79 seconds 179 seconds, then you still need to fly to a reactor, or maybe in your case, you're probably just going to build the reactor near the star port. So that's another 30 seconds added on The thing that limits your timing is going to be Stim, Combat Shield and your MEDAVX And if one of those doesn't line up properly, your entire timing is going to be delayed because you can't push without one of these three things I also don't understand why you're building barracks away from reactors Well, it's obvious you want as many units as possible I'm curious if this is going to be tanks, I wouldn't even mind it too much You can do a two-based push with tanks That is actually a completely fine thing to do But your entire early game here made very very very little sense. Also, whenever you're playing a 2-base Al-in or a 2-base push, most of the time you don't want to get more than a single Starport unit because of the reasons I mentioned earlier Now here you're at least going to get one METAVAC and already one Benchie and you'll need to wait for the cloak so you're probably going to get a second Benchie as well This is absolutely not how you're supposed to be playing this matchup Absolutely not If you wanted to play two Benchie with Cloak before your 2Base Al-in, at least you shouldn't have built your MetaVac so that these barracks could have just straight up flown over to this tech lab to start stim. Because right now you're adding two more tech labs, you already have two tech labs, you're just going to have an empty tech lab, just like you have an empty reactor over here that hasn't been used in a very long time If you dealt some damage, you've killed 16 workers That I do appreciate, but you would have been capable of doing that without your terrible build order as well This is the funny thing is that some Grandmaster players, they kind of have this little, this little trick, that they use or this little, this build that they've been doing ever since they grew up, you know, they advanced through the ladder And they think that is the reason that they're grandmaster now. So they're sticking with it Well, in reality, they have gotten this high on the ladder despite their hot garbage build order Because what in the world is this? Look at this Starport isn't even on a reactor yet We're six minutes and 33 seconds into the game This is the timing at which Bunny hit against Rainer in G S Season 3, I think it was, the last GSL season He hit with two tanks, three metaphics, I think it was, or maybe two metaphax, one Viking and like 18 or 20 Marines Stim, combat shield, I think plus one probably was also done. You, so far, I've hit your opponent with a Benchie that is a minute and a half too late, a little bit of Helion harass, and that is about it I think Bunny had 120 supply at this point in his opponent's base, while also having Helions in the early game It wasn't like he just rushed into that No, he had Helions in the early game He built a Viking in the early game This is how much worse your build is compared to your opponent A lot It is just a lot Triple taglaps That is obviously incorrect This is he saw that he had a tech lab left over I was like, oh crap, I need to use it. Are people going to make fun of me? Let me just fly in another Paris there He's building a lot of marauders Now, I never see marauders in two-based parts push us in TVZ, probably because they cost some gas and it makes the build a little bit less tight But I don't mind the thought, honestly If you think about it, this is actually kind of smart You want some extra tanking So despite this not being standard, people always say, oh, you only say the standard thing It's like, no, if I see something that is smart and isn't standard, I can say that is smart and not standard I think marauders here are actually quite smart They're definitely a good call in my mind. Yeah, because you can tank banlings with them If your opponent is building roaches, they're going to be good as well And it's either going to be banlings and roaches Having a couple of marauders, yes, it decreases the damage output your army has, but it increases the tankability I wonder how important this I've never seen other terrorists do this, though I'm not sure if that is because it's just not common because it isn't standard, or if this is, I don't actually know why this is I, I legit don't know All right, I got my answer real quick I asked my friends on Skype They said it is because it uses up too much production time Two Marines are better than one marauder. And usually with two bas-a-l-lins, it's not the cost that you're lacking You know, it's a You actually just want more damage, more units Make some sense I don't mind the thought, though I actually think this is an okay thought It's an incorrect thought, apparently, but I hadn't thought of it either, so I'm not going to flame you for it That would be very hypocritical of me to do I don't mind You have a lot of tanks Wait, what am I hearing? These guys are tapping the rocks Okay, look This is, I think, everything you need to know about your build order is we don't even have to look at you We just look at the Zirk. What is Zirk doing? Zirk is going into Hive, infestation pit, Lurkerden, double Evo chamber upgrades, range, Carapace, 66 workers and 4 bases, okay? Your opponent thinks your build is so bad that he can can get away with all of this He doesn't even scout if you have a third, but he sees you hit at the eight minute marks He's like, okay, this guy's an idiot There's no way this is a two base all in Because the two base all in supposed to hit two full minutes ago, Grandmaster player This is how bad your build order is People just don't respect it Is that what I said? And I ain't taking it back There's two little queens here from the Zerk side. This actually should be a win This actually should be a win Scan the creep or scan this creep, move the tanks forward Oh my God, you have no killing Killer instinct What is this? This is not having brunch with your mother-in-law You're a, you're a hitman, my friend You need to kill stuff They have some killer instinct You can just stand around and do nothing for, for, for 30 seconds This is an all in This is also not quite how you want to use the marauders, I think You need the marines This is, this is incorrect No, come on Okay, the fight still was good, but the tune of it, look at this, okay. The way you want to use the marauders is obviously you use them in front as tanking and have the marines kind of behind them They need to be used as tanking They're not your main damage output If you want to use them as main damage output, it's not what they're used for Usually send like three or four ahead You force your opponent to engage into you and there's more marauders in the back, but half of your marines aren't even covered by marauders here This is, I really like you figuring out the marauder thing, but this is kind of like, inventing the light bulb just to stick it up your bum It's like, well, it's a great invention We have light. It's like, yeah, my bomb It's not entirely what you want now, is it? This was garbage, but still a fight that you completely want because you're just so far ahead Your early game must have been fantastic I completely missed it, honestly I was so upset by the other things you were doing I really believe that if you were to have a regular build order, you would be quite good Like your, your macro seems completely fine He did this without upgrades That's a little yikesy actually This is another minus How's it possible you hit two minutes late with less stuff and without upgrade? This was one hell of a fight as well Woo. It's not a good type of who, you know? That's the type of who you have and you fall in a coy pond or something like that This is not nice Holy crap That's a bad fight Lost three tanks, I think, or four tanks for free there This is better, maybe? Micro the Marines back Keep the marauders in front Almost correct Tank dies You're still so far ahead, though You have a third base, right? Third base flying over, long distance mining The one thing I don't mind, which is the one thing you mentioned that you did wrong, is that you have your third base a little bit late Yes, it's bad for you, but it's completely irrelevant because you're so far ahead anyway. That I don't really mind all that much Okay, now we have eBay Second eBay Armory coming in as well and you have 67 army supply against 22 there's 21 links two queens and nine morphing baines against 25 marines nine marauders and eight meta-ex this game is unloosable if you had any killer instinct whatsoever here you would have just eaten this guy alive but you my friend legit have the killer instinct of a llama they don't have a lot of killer instinct instinct i think they only eat leaves i do believe they're the ones that spit on people though aren't they there they're these guys I also think it's spelled with two L's the Lama It's a weird spelling. You feel like there would be an H in there somewhere, but I don't think there is It thinks there's LL-A-A-L-A-L-A-L-A-L-A-L-A-L-A-L-A-L-S-me-E-L-L-E-L-E-L-E-L-E-L-E-L-E-E-L-E-FX I mean, this game is still completely over I'm really looking forward to seeing how you're going to manage this one Okay, a little bit of overstimming, well, a little bit You have nine meta-fax for 12 units, and all of them are in the orange And all meta-vexs are empty This was a bad fight again Do you have a little bit of money issues as well? But not the type of money issues people usually have to know In real life if someone tells you they have money issues, you wouldn't expect to see them float 1500 minerals in the bank and 600 gas. No, they usually be in the red. Luckily that's not possible in StarCraft 2. But this doesn't look great for you. Well it, no, actually still does look great for you, but given how bad your fights are, it doesn't look great for you. You know, this is, it's like if I were, if I were to do a foot race with someone, and I am 40 meters ahead of them in a 100 meter race, that looks good for me, unless I'm racing against Usain Bolt, and I have to moonwalk. Now, I can moonwalk pretty quick. I don't think I'd be capable of beating Usain Bolt in his 100 meters, when I still have 60 meters to moonwalk. Although, maybe I'll have to try it. I call up Usain one of these days I'll make a video out of it as well Me and him have been tied for a very long time already Humble Brack Well, it's just a regular brag again Vehicle weapons Plus two was this Infantry weapons, level two Two liberators on the way Two more liberators on the way Four tanks coming in as well No ghost No nothing but an army supply advantage of about 160 supply. I just, I always, so I said this before, but whenever I look at a game, I always think what are the, like how can the underdog party right now, how could the underdog party win? And I also always think to myself, how could the winning player possibly lose? And if you're the losing party, you want to increase the chance of the things happening that make you win And as the winning party, you want to make sure that you can finish the game or make sure that you don't lose You just eliminate all the options that your opponent has And right now, I'm looking at this situation It's going to be four base against, I guess, three, three and a half. I mean, this base is dead So one thing could be you run out of scans that is one thing that I can see you have four tanks you have four liberators there's only three vipers if you get ghost I don't think there's a even without ghosts I think if you just split up your army and attack into any position there's nothing that the zirc can do six lurkers just aren't enough to fight against an army this big it's 14 marauders as well it feels like you can just walk in of course after killing the hatchery that's being built at the gold That would be a detail that I would like to add I think that is actually a good play. Although it takes a little bit of time away and might delay your timing in this case, I do believe that would be the correct move to go for There's marauders over here I could definitely take out this spot as well Okay Loses one tank Loses two tanks Why did he scan this area for a creep? It doesn't kill the final creep tumor There's another impressive move Now another scan for it Scan this area three times already He isn't quite sure if we can engage into this Now decides not to And then goes for the hatchery, okay So we wanted to see if there was an opportunity to attack into this before killing the hatch I don't completely mind that honestly. There was no macro behind this Do we have a ghost academy yet? Yes, we do Do we have ghost production? Yes, we do as well Very nice Five ghosts on the way More liberators as well Now, a thing you would want to do over here is you deny all the creep on the map, and you just go rotate between these two bases Your opponent can literally never move out You're always fighting on your terms Counterattacks are going to be close to impossible You have liberators for harass You have tanks for safety at home You're building ghost You're getting better upgrades than your opponent What are these liberators defending? The Hill? He's just playing King of the Hill with himself, maybe Oh, Adios, Crook-Tummer. This is a good scan There's just no speed here whatsoever I feel like Luellis heard the word slow push once I was like, all right, that is now my spirit animal And other people try to explain that that's not how spirit animal works And that spirit animals actually need to be an animal You can't just say that slow pushing is a spirit animal But we'll count it This has been some really slow pushing this entire game Oh, this looks like some potential here for the fight Oh, parasitic bombs being cast Nice split Good splits there on the meta-fax Very nice Snipes going down as well Beautiful stuff Lurkers moving in right now to, oh, this is just great. Now, there is a really sick trick actually, but not a lot of people know about Then I'm going to tell you right now is that if that lurkers are in the middle of the map and you're up 50 supply is that it most likely means that lurkers aren't defending any of the other bases Oh, actually there's two lurkers here Can't just kill that with two drops though Whenever a lurker army is out and about, it means defense is weak as well So what you can do is you can send some metaphax around the counterattack to kill the bases because eventually your Liberator Ghost Army should be capable of clearing this I hope hello, scan Okay, also fine Well, not completely fine. Parasidicot takes out what, five liberators here or just three We're going for four Oh, just two That's a lucky liberator here with 3 HP Might want to repair that as well More ghost on the way Honestly, these fights have not been bad Yes, you lost three ghosts for no good reason, but I still think You're fine Cheeky tank split off over here Thomas the tank engine Wait, you're actually going for a run by with a tank? That's unheard of You're up a base No extra More extra ghosts are being added These guys are dying Surely at this point you realize that if you just go attack and keep map control, there's literally no way that you can lose. The Lurgers are only scary if they're on your side of the map You're completely going to be out-expanding your opponent You should not be chasing into this arm If the Lurker army is in a position already where you are not, because you are out of position, then you can't attack into it anymore That's the one thing where Lurkers are good at, my friend Literally the one thing Liberators set up, not all at the same spot because of parasitic bomb Oh, fly away all at the same spot Also fine Lose three How many are we going to lose here? Four? Four Liberators, I think And we killed nothing Instead, we're just chasing these guys Lost a bunch of SCVs as well. I think he was actually starting to become a little bit close Not a huge fan of that Still nine ghost out So once again, if you're in position, you have some map vision You know where your opponent's army is This should not be an issue Because the thing about ghost is the way that they're used defensively here is actually beautiful You're in position The opponent tries to move in and you do the phew, phew You snip him and he has to piss off again The problem here is that you're just never in position So you're always going to be engaging into a lurker spot. Rather than doing that, what I would say, if you're out of position, it's like, hey, keep the ghost over here, put some liberators on top of it, and a cup of Ooh! Okay, I'm going to come to this First, if your opponent is in a position like this and there's 12 lurkers, now what you want to do is snipe off the lurkers one by one with your ghost So you snipe, snip, snip, snip, use eight snipes per lurker, and then shift click your ghost back So that the moment the snipe gets cancelled or it goes off, your ghost move back to safety. What you do is you send your entire army in while you're sniping, every single snip gets cancelled, all of your bio dies There's splash damage If the lurker is attacking one ghost or 10 Marines and a ghost, it doesn't matter to the lurker Well, ideally they attack more, but it's still going to hit the ghost So you'd rather not have the Marines there for the collateral damage It just doesn't make any sense Instead, what you do is you keep a little bit of the bio behind, and the rest is counter-attacking, picking off bases that are out on the map, or maybe dealing with this single lurker or with this link run by that is coming for you. Then with the two liberators that you still have, and you could keep one over here maybe defending this base that is mining, one SCV at a time, you could actually maybe have to be forced to lift it, but at least you're dealing damage on the other side as well, and you can snip them off one by one eventually The Zerk is going to realize what's happening over here We'll need to lift up all lurkers at the same time, and then you snip five more lurkers all of a sudden your opponent only has 20 links and four hydras and three vipers, and you win the game. Congratulations, you're now Maru, as you call it, or just any regular Terran player with more than 85 IQ, which apparently only is Maru Now, next up, after this absolutely awful fight, you say something very interesting I'll speak to it G G I guess Lurker's Inba Now, you don't have to say Gigi if you don't want to If you don't think it was a good game, don't do it But this is some weird backhanded compliment, which it's not even a compliment I'm not sure what it is It's in between Imagine you just had dinner Imagine you're seven again You just had dinner and you didn't like it. Your mom, you know, slaved away in the kitchen, your dad slaved away in the kitchen for five hours And it made the most amazing dish But you just didn't like it because your taste buds are underdeveloped and you're a spoiled little bread And then rather than saying, man, this sucked, you could just say nothing That is a fine thing What you did instead is here you complimented the food You said, oh, this was okay, I guess And then there's a pause and then you go, but a dish sucked or potato sucked It's like, what? First of all, how can you hate potatoes? Potatoes are literally delicious Fries are made of them. And second of all, why would you do that to your parents? That's a messed up thing, Luo Liss Just like it's a messed up thing here to pretend like you thought it was a G And then immediately kind of discredit your opponent's performance by saying that he only went due to the lurker being in balance Despite it being obvious, it was you who was the idiot who walked his entire bio ghost army into a position with 12 lurkers rather than just cleaning it up It's like, yeah, you have different ways of cleaning things up If you have, imagine you have like a puddle of water and dirt Like, you're not going to use the vacuum cleaner for that most of the time. You'll use something else, like a mop or something I don't know I don't clean Everything is dirty in my house But, you know, specific dirt requires specific solutions here, you didn't use the specific solution at all Just a quick recap here Your build order was garbage from start to finish Your bunker was out too far I'd just like to mention that, although it had no impact on this game Your third base flew over late, but we weren't going to talk about it You put a light bulb up your bum, which is always incorrect And on top of that, you microde like a complete idiot in every single fight That included ghosts Oh, and the final one, you had no killer instinct. literally the killer instinct of a llama We put all six of these together and it only leads to one conclusion You suck, my friend And that is what it is All right, that's going to be it for me today Thanks so much for watching I hope you did enjoy this episode of Is it Inba or Do I Suck? If you did not forget the like, but subscribe to the channel, hopefully I'll see all of you next time for a new video Thank you and bye-bye Thank you."

        "text": "Oh, Captain, my Captain, I must say, Harstam, you are looking quite dashing today Unfortunately, that is the end of my kindness today After much deliberation and consideration with an elite group of StarCrat 2 players, the All Things Protos Discord, I think I speak for all Protos players when I say, Terran is Inba First of all, if there is one thing that the All Things Protos Discord is very elite at, it's either wine or being idiots and probably both things at the same time, but I'm not quite sure if it would be considered an elite group of StarCraft 2 players But I digress It's so simple to play Terran honestly I got placed in Diamond 3, drunk and without a build, exclamation mark. You know what I did, CAF? Dot, dot, dot, dot I made Stim Stim is the most broken upgrade in all of StarCraft 2 All you need to do is press Z for my grid enjoyers and A move in 3-3-prudus Don't matter Marine's Shred And the cherry on top of this melted ice cream Sunday is the ghost Oh boy, the ghost That puppy can invalidate a 200, 200 Trotus Army with the click of a button I need to micro my heart out and Terran gets the aim move There is a reason Starkriff two offers Terran as the beginner race It is so easy And I know this isn't a skill issue or the problem with me My builds are crisper than an autumn apple. I would give Hero a run for his money Honestly And I am a known, of duty and joyer My mouse security is impeccable, as I have a very high headshot percentage in modern warfare too Keff, I implore you, please observe this game and give us Proto's the answer we all know deep in our heart Terran is Imba P S Hamster, I love you and you're looking quite good today as well All right Name Echo Soldier, race Protos in the Diamond League with 3 1K MMR And my boy, Echo Soldier is very angry, very upset about Terran and asks whether they're imbalanced or if he sucks So let's figure it out. Before we continue with our scheduled program, we hired private investigator Herbert Amster to look a little bit deeper into those claims Echo Soldier made about Terran He said he immediately got ranked Diamond 3 and just a move to victory But the last official record of his Terran career dates back to late March with a whopping 33% win rate in Platinum 3 So he dropped the race after just six games Of course, Assytupils is not an official Blizzard website, but those heavily support our revelation as his Terran is just level 11 So to conclude, obviously, Echo Soldier is a Terran expert, and his A-Move Strat worked flawlessly against the whole two people We are in for a great one. All right, that brings us over here to Cosmic Sapphire, the map that dreams are made of Pretty beautiful map Good for Protos as well we see a gas-first opener coming out of our Terran player An Echo Soldier opens up with a gateway first into an assimilator Cheeky gateway scout, not checking around for any proxies as he just right away moves across the map and goes for a scout We'll figure out immediately what is going on here Now, the moment you scout a gas first, you know what's coming for you It's just going to be a faster factory most of the time Reaper into factory, the most common option. Although sometimes you see Marine Interfactory in which the factory gets built, before the command center gets thrown down Against both of these things that the Tarrant can do, you need to be extremely careful of early aggression because it just hits a fair chunk faster than it usually would Ooh, Nexus coming down at 19 Would you look at that? 19 Nexus, 19 core This is actually one of my favorite builders at the moment, except the core didn't really get built at 19? Hey, this is not okay, all right? I'm just, I just kind of want everyone to see this. I don't mind if you're playing 19 Nexus, 19 core, I'm a fan of this build order, but if you play this, build the core at 19 Don't build the core at 19 while you're floating 70 minerals, because then it's just a 70 core, and it's a 20 core where you're floating 20 minerals That's incorrect I do not enjoy that If you're playing a build order, play it correctly, especially if it's such a tiny, beautiful variation that's become a lot more popular recently again, that I'm a huge fan of This also pisses me off already I did not want to press the B button, which makes me go back about 15 seconds in the replay, before the two-minute mark. That's one of the rules I have in IOT is that I don't want to be too annoying in the early game But this just pisses me off And I just want to have a look at the first person view here Because either Echo Soldier can't count or the second option is he has absolutely no idea about priorities here Look at this Look at this Hop, probe micro, oh my god, look at that sick probe micro, managed to block his opponent's CC for almost a full nine or ten seconds While floating 300 minerals, forgetting his second gas, forgetting to continue building workers and not getting a second pylon, meaning that he's actually going to be supply blocked when his core finishes. My builds are crisper than an autumn apple, which means that there's absolutely no use whatsoever here in getting that fast core or in even trying to get that fast core Now we get, oh my god, that's beautiful Chrono booster here on the probes as well, no pylon whatsoever Completely new build order here to start with That's exactly what I like to see Here on my, what is it, Monday morning, Wednesday evening I don't even know what day it is anymore Life flies by It's like I'm paralyzed by it Now, we have a reactor as well as a factory following up Do we believe that Echo Soldier understood that this was a gas first? I don't truly believe it I don't think so. I don't see anything. Well, it's very difficult to see whether he's playing safe or not, as his Nexus just finished at the exact same time as the Pylon. His first Gateway unit is starting 30 seconds too late. 30 seconds! That is very, very impressive. So you could forget your Pylon entirely, then build it, and then still be finished around this time. He also could have just not built the second Pylon because his Nexus would finish before his Pylon would finish. How many workers did this bad boy kill? Three workers get killed by the Reaper as a result of that. You make a major error in the early game, and it actually gets punished. Now, I didn't know this happened at Diamond 3. Usually I thought what would happen at Diamond 3 is that one player makes a massive mistake, and then the other guy looks at it, goes like, yeah, I think I can do worse than that, and then sends seven SEVs across the map accidentally, walks it into a cannon, lifts both of his command centers at the same tau, while simultaneously being supply block for 30 minutes in a row But apparently diamond, what was this? I think it's Diamond 1, 3100 MMR Maybe Diamond 2, I have no clue Whatever it is, at least the Taryn is playing a real build order, and that kind of makes me happy Actually, pretty decent build order as well So far, marine production has been on point. Out of our Protos, so far nothing has been on point, except for the gas mining We have five workers in a single gas So just in case two workers get killed by another weeper hop in, there will still be three workers going at it On top of that, these gateways were also way too late What was this builder? I haven't been paying it out Nice We also did a chrono boost This is one of my favorite things to do is when you build your gateways too late, is to chrono boost out your warp gate to truly kind of put a focus on the fact that your gateways are so late already. I'm not sure if he's trying to kind of reinvent the wheel here with a terrible build order This is twilight cancel Insanely late Like actually insane late Holy crap My builds are crisper than an autumn apple I was going to compare this to a regular build, but I don't even think it's possible Like, it just wouldn't make any sense Usually, Blink is supposed to finish up in about 25 seconds from now But instead, it's going to finish up in about 7 No, what? In about 100 seconds from now You're legitimately a minute and a half behind the regular timing Or a minute behind? No, minute and a half behind in the regular timing That's very impressive Your gateways were too late as well. I don't even think you can use all your gateways You should have just stayed on two gate because you have so little workers It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever You're reinventing the wheel It's like you've been stuck in the lab for five years, reinventing the wheel You'll come out with a square It's like, well, first of all, that's worse than what you came out with And second of all, it's really not a wheel It's way worse than what you came out with That's the same thing twice that I just said That's completely okay It can be creative all the time Now, we have a double mind drop four marines coming in. Blink should have been done about 20 seconds ago, 25 seconds ago, especially given the fact that this was a Nexus before core You usually have a little bit more gas with that But none of that You basically had all the risks and none of the rewards That's a very, very cool move That's like juggling with crocodiles in the morning for no reason whatsoever, not even putting it on YouTube Like what's the point? And also why are you hurting these crocodiles by juggling them? What is this? Solid response ones Always wonder what these people look at when this happens Three pilots Now, you might be wondering why they're being built in an almost perfect triangle formation That is because. I guess this is the smallest amount of vision that it could grant you while still looking like you randomly placed them So you create a lot of space to build gateways But you get no vision with this whatsoever It actually costs some amount of effort as well to put them this far apart Rather than just clicking them, bam, bomb, bomb, you have to go all the way up your miles and then down again It's quite impressive Still didn't quite see what you're looking at right now Let's have another look at it First person view, first person view, first person view Here come to three pilots, a beautiful little triangle She's that there's five workers in gas here Looks at the mini map. Oh, she's the Metafact flying to vision right now Like, hey, that looks interesting Ah, dang it didn't manage to right click this Should I split? Probably too late I'll just lose all of my workers instead Very cool indeed Huge fan of these moves, personally Absolutely huge fan of these moves So far, you've lost 14 workers in a 5 minutes game, which is an impressive pace, honestly A very impressive pace Armory is on the way Okay, the Terran Build Order also makes no sense, though Double eBay? An armory already on the way? plus one before stim and plus one before combat. Now, this barcode is very lucky that he didn't send in the replay, because I would have tore him another one for this build order Luckily, Echo Schroeder is playing so extremely poor that it doesn't even really matter I mean, what is this garbage? We have some oversupply right now We have 33 workers We still have five workers in gas I don't even think we have a follow-up plan here yet That seems absolutely impossible to have any follow-up here whatsoever There's just no cash in the bank either Two observers are being built Adapt dies for free Observer goes in and scouts right now sees, what is this? This is another barracks coming down She's the star port producing metaphax already. There's no stim or combat yet This game is insane Do we have a robo bay while staying on two gas? And two more gates I love that you looked at your base You looked at your situation and you thought to yourself, what could I really need right now in this spot? I have no money I can't afford any of my production structures I have three gateways and a robo already Let me just add two more gateways that I definitely cannot afford Wasting 300 minerals, which could have been used for a faster nexus or for some gases in your next row To actually get a colossus the moment this robobo finishes, you decided to just waste it into these two gateways. My built are crisper than an ultimate apple This kind of feels like that we're stuck on an island together, and after I spent five hours long building a shelter, You come over and you tell me that you used all of our medical supplies to build a guitar that you can tune It's like, what? Why would you do this? First, you waste our medical supplies and then you give me a useless guitar, which only has four strings as well It's like a crappy bass And no one likes base This is also. What do they have that these don't? Do they allow you to stay up for 20 more minutes to play another video game? Do they bring you coffee in the morning, these assimilators? What do they have that they don't? Now they're good enough for you Now they're good enough. all game long they weren't good enough but first you take these assimilators on the third base and then on the natural very cool moves some nice prioritization there my friend definitely the smart thing to do the base that isn't finished yet getting the gases there that is just fantastic it's like if you can't make ends meet at the end of the month and you're not quite sure how take a look at your bill see that you spend $400 on dental floss and that is despite you having no teeth because you don't understand how to operated toothbrush Now, here you go with your fancy assimilators at your third base Base is going to get taken out before you get any mining from it. You're actually completely dead already And the rest of this game, I can already feel it, is going to be me wondering why you haven't realized that yet, and me then figuring out that you haven't realized it yet Actually, no, you have scouting information I'm going to think that it's because you don't have any scouting information, but you should be rather aware right now that you're pretty dead There's six barracks here There is one one upgrades on the Terran Army already You're down 40 supply, down a base, down 20 workers You don't even have charge yet, which I don't quite understand as possible You researched thermal lens and then went into a disruptor Did you already lose a Colossus? No. He just decided not to build it Solid waste of money into the thermal lens You love to see it Boom Why would you get a disdemeanor? disruptor after getting thermal lands first How is it possible that you only have one robo units, but you could afford thermal lens? This makes no sense Your priorities are so insanely off It's actually ridiculous Why are you taking out the rocks? You're obviously in a defensive position where every little bit of map texture, anything that blocks your opponent from moving up, is going to help you It's going to force your opponent to move through a tighter choke in which maybe you get the disruptor shot of a lifetime Like, I don't quite understand it Solid move. To the far left side I'm not sure if this is making sure that there's no gold base here, or maybe Echo Soldier believed that the Terran actually spawned at the gold and thought he had full access to his main base In that case, this observer must be really confused Like, wait, he also has three bases over here, but I thought the gold was his main Man, this map is a mess Observer speed? Why are we getting grapetic boosters right now? Surely Yeah, I guess because you have four observers How can a man with so much vision be so blind for his own mistakes? Kevin the Conning, 2022 Actually, not that bad It's a good quote to end the year with. Like, you have literally done absolutely nothing correct You're just randomly moving around the map You're not trying to gain map control Like, the one, whenever you look at a game, you should be wondering, how can I win this game? Is there anything I can do to win this game? And immediately a couple of things come to mind Like, either I'm going to get insane disruptor shots My opponent will attack into a super battery and I'm defining with Colossus And maybe I can go for a run-by with zealots while my opponent is moving out For all of this, you need very detailed information of various opponents' armies You need observers over here You need this watchtower You need disruptors in position. You need batteries in order to be capable to actually defend when your opponent decides to attack None of this is happening You're pretending like this is a normal game, but you're down 50 supply You're going to be down freaking infinite amount of upgrades Your opponent legitimately is going to have more barracks than you have gateways I think this might be the first time that this ever happened in the history of Starcraft If this wasn't already a completely new, unique game by the insane amount of terrible move that you had made, the fact that this Starrant just got more barracks done than you finished gateways in this game would have made it a completely unique game My man is building four turrets. He's afraid of you right now That's just because he doesn't know you, because anyone that knows you would never be afraid of you, not with this level of play This is truly horrific of the concepts of making a comeback have been used so far None of it You've literally been dead since minute four Then you died again when you lost your third Then I died looking at you play Like, you probably killed a couple of my viewers today Maybe with boredom, maybe just due to the terrible decisions It makes people's heart beat faster I actually quite often get emails from doctors telling me to not put out IOTuses anymore because it hurts a patient that they have. It's like their blood pressure can't handle it This is going to be a push where you need to throw the disruptors into your opponent's army First disrupt the shot hits absolutely nothing, which is impressive This taron honestly micros quite well I'm actually somewhat impressed by this Terran I don't quite understand how both of you are the same level He also has like 60 APMR What's this super battery doing? What? Did you just use the best defensive tool around? To heal up your army a little bit without fighting? Not using it on top units? This is like scratching your butt with a stinger while your opponent only has helicopters It's like that's not really what it's supposed to do, my friend. You shoot it at the things that fly with the propellers This has truly been a horrific game Why would you even send this? If you couldn't spot mistakes in this Like, they were so clear as they I don't even quite know Usually there is some Something, a slightly redeeming quality to the play But here there was nothing You lost four workers to a Reaper your initial cybernetic score was 30 seconds, or your first unit was 30 seconds too slow You got supply blocked after your first pylon This is literally still within the first five lines of a build order guide. If this is the elite of the All Things Proloss, I don't want to see a bad player from the All Things Prodals Discord Stay out of my emails Stay out of my forms This was the worst game I think I've ever seen How is this diamond? I know North America wasn't doing that halt, but holy crap, you guys are in trouble And it also once again shows that call of duty players truly are there with inferior IQ Like this is just complete garbage gameplay You lose every single worker to a mind drop Then you lose your third base for free And then the game is over And you stay in for six minutes, seven minutes, waste everyone's time, including mine. And then you write this complaint form, which honestly was quite good decently funny, this is the worst game I've seen I can't believe that you honestly look at this game and think there was nothing wrong with this It is simply impossible I'm a very bad artist, okay? I've drawn things before in art class And one time I went to a thing called, I think it was called the wine bar where you drank, like the wine art studio or something, where you drank wine, and then you had to make, I think it was tulips My two lips ended up looking like wine glasses And it wasn't. good, but I looked at it and I thought to myself, I could improve a lot of things on this It was one of the worst art pieces that I've ever seen in my entire life And it was the same with this game I would never dare sending that to, you know, the paintbrush manufacturer or the paint manufacturer and start complaining about the quality of their brushes or the quality of their paint I knew that it was my own terrible painting skills that sucked so hard It had nothing to do with anything else and you, my friend, should really get that same self-awareness because this was not imbalanced You just suck And that is how it is. And that is going to be it as well for me today A little bit sick I'm going to go to bed, sleep for 25 hours I come back tomorrow I hope to have some better IOTIS forms in my inbox If you think you can do better than this, be sure to leave something down in the description below There's a Google form there where you can click it, you can upload it, and I'll have a look at it But this is the last time I'm doing something like this Last time I got a game this bad Like, I urge people to leave their email I'll just flame you personally, but I'm not going to subject other people to this garbage. Because that is what it was Utter garbage Thank you for watching And bye-bye."

Now that would be a wild confidence boost for our NA friends! But maybe Marines and Marauders are just IMBA over there. They have THE nation of guns after all.",
        "video_id": "KLQ1_R_v05E",
        "text": "Dear Harstam, I am a super fan of you from China Terran Liberators and Sensor Towers are just too Imba and Marauders My Gateway Units are as fragile as paper in front of them I came to study in Canada, so I had to create a new account on the NA server to play This game happened again before I was promoted to Master Three I have reached the top 100 of the Grandmaster in the Chinese server, 5,200 MMR But as of the time I emailed you, I only hit 4.3K MMR on the NA server And my record is 19 wins and 4 losses I also often watch a rank roulette show. I thought I could come to North America to show my strengths, but this 4,000 MMR diamond tarrant beat me back to Iyer I'll admit that I made a few small mistakes in my early game defense But the timing of his first airdrop was so weird that I lost seven probes at 5 5 minutes But I countered immediately and destroyed his raven and perfectly defended his first push with tanks Maybe I underestimated the enemy I saw a 4,000-em-mar diamond terran I think I just need to complete a normal build here, build some gateway units, block his first push and end the game quickly, like on the Chinese server But this dude's macro and micro are beyond my understanding of diamonds. So I tried multitasking with DTs and Prisms to weight my high-tech AOE units, such like high-tech Templar and Disruptor I laughed at the screen when I saw that he couldn't even operate his own bio to avoid the disruptor's attack God, what a loser? But what does it matter? When I saw swarms of Liberators drawing circles over the heads of my people, when I saw my multitasking was easily blocked by the sensor tower, missile tower and the fortress When the ghost hides behind the tank and the Liberator and releases an EMP bigger than a ball, I skillfully press F10 plus N. So please tell me, Captain, it is Inba, or do I suck? Sincerely, Kwan Li Liu, also known as Sergio, and the in-game name is 6KM, a protos player right now in Masters 3 in North America, Chinese top 100 grandmaster, struggling to beat a North American diamond terran player with EMPs bigger than a ball And he asked, is it Inba or do I suck? And we're going to find out today All right, here we go inside and out Six kilometers versus Echo And this seems to be a diamond TVP on the North American server So far, I'm not that disappointed honestly by the builder Look at this CC went down at a normal timing Reaper started at an okay time as well. We have an SEV patrolling this area Why I'm not so sure But these players seem to have some idea of what to do in life and in this game in general Opener to be player Oh my god, a core first and the core finish is at 201 Pylon finished a bit too late, but I can live with that This is a very impressive thing to do this wall All right is I think currently the only map in the map that has two Reaper jump-in spots Which means if you're going to wall a Reaper jump-in spot, there's still another one left, which is annoying, but yet we still see it done a lot. What I haven't seen before, however, is out of the three locations that are wallable, is to pick the one location that is not actually a Reaper jump-in spot There is debris here, we can see it better on this side, that blocks the Reaper from jumping in This is a Reaper jumping spot This is a Reaper jumping spot And if you want to block it, usually block this entire area This does absolutely nothing This is as if you have two cold feet, you have one sock and you decide to put it on your dung It's like, well, that's not going to keep your feet warm for a very long time, my friend Trust me on that We have blink, okay, at a decent time. Wait, this is a third unit blink No Not a huge fan of this personally Blink starts very late with this type of opener If you get a third gateway unit before you start the blink You might as well just not throw the tech down as fast in that case I just don't quite understand why people would play like this I also saw some minor cuts already in the work account Chroneboos not being spent nor on Blink or on Probes, which is bad as well So yeah, this hasn't been the most tiding opener here out of 6KM or the greatest opener in general Gateway timing is solid The robotics facility timing technically is solid as well It's not getting supply blocked. So, I mean, it is an opener, but it's just not very tight Once again, Chrono boost very late, Probeckham a little bit lower than it should be We have no pylon spread at all around the map We have nothing here on the bottom Usually your third pylon is in a location where it helps you spot something So you want to think about your buildings and your pylons as things that actually can have a purpose as well So your first buildings will create a wall often in the main base, either on the ramp or around your mineral line in case of like a Reaper jumping in You can block that off Maybe it's easier to hide your tech as well. Then your second pylon is often used in your natural to create a bit of a wall there So you have a gateway, a robo, in case of like some massive halion attack, or it can even be nice against TREX build orders as well, where you just have a bit of a wall It makes it harder for your opponent to just straight up run in Now, once we get to the third pylon, the third pylon is often used to provide extra vision on the map So we see it on the very, like, the six o'clock over here on the very bottom part of this base So the moment a matter of fact flies in through this angle, you can actually spot it. And then the fourth pylon often gets positioned over here It's like a double purpose One, it spots this general area And on top of that, it can provide a position for a battery to defend your third base, as well as just have a fast warping possibility for your third And all the pylons really serve a bit of a purpose Now, in this case, this third pylon doesn't serve a purpose at all This fourth one at least spot something on the side, but still, complete blindness on the far right side of this map, and it forces these stalkers to be in this position. Ideally, you want the stalkers to be kind of in between, and then you have a spotter over here and a spotter over here, and depending where the MataVec shows up, you can quickly move into position to figure out, hey, what's going on here? Where do my units need to be? I have blink I can probably still catch it Blink is really late If this was a standard mine drop, this would have absolutely not been in time And the matter of fact, drop would have just gone in and gone out with all their mines still completely intact, most likely Because the stalkers are severely out of position Well, unless the matter of fact comes from the bottom side, of course. Like this has been a pure gamble so far out of 6KM man, let me just read what he said again in his thing He said, I'll admit that I made a few small mistakes in my early game defense, but the timing of his first airdrop was so weird that I lost seven probes at five and a half minutes Now, I'm going to say to you right now, 6KM, that you should be very, very happy with the fact that the air drop or the mind drop wasn't any quicker. Because rather than losing seven workers at five and a half minutes, you would have lost seven workers at four and a half minutes or four minutes and 20 seconds because you simply just weren't in people position and did not have the correct tools, the correct vision, the blink in time to deal with it And now you had a little bit more time Losing seven workers, if you have 49 workers, is a lot less bad than if you were to lose seven workers, if you have 35, because the percentage of your income that you lose is just a little bit smaller And it's also easier to reproduce as you have a third, as you have a third base finishing up soon. So workers are already kind of easy to reproduce This sucks, don't get me wrong, you don't want to lose it But you can just rebuild them You have plenty of kronoboose saved up in case you want to krono boost your carrier switch, I guess I'm not quite sure why we're not chronobusing anything at all I'm also not quite sure we're building a cannon in our mineral line That seems like a massive waste of money This is the famed raven snipe So loses two stalker, kills a four stalker, kills a bunch of marines and kills a raven Now, I have to say that is a little bit different. than what you said here in your balanced complaint form, I'm not entirely happy with this one yet, I countered immediately and destroyed his raven Although that information is technically true, it's technically correct information you countered and destroyed his raven, you admitted a very important part is that you also lost four stalkers here, which in my mind just isn't completely fair It's basically if you told your parents you came home, you know, after a night of drinking, you came home and fed the dog And in the morning they wake up and they see like a yellow lining on the car because you decided last night in your drunken haste to also, you know, pee on the car. In theory, you didn't lie to your parents when you said that you came home and fed the dog But you kind of forgot a very important part is that the car now smells terrible and your dad can't drive it to work anymore It's the same here You lost four stalkers Yes, he killed a raid and a couple of marines, but this actually wasn't that great of a trade for you at all You pretty much lost your aggressive presence on the map Your opponent feels solid enough now, or strong enough, to go with a counter mine drop already as well So I'm not so sure if that was a biggest win as you made it out to be Observer still providing vision. Of course, it's nice because the raven is gone Upcrites are really fast for this terran, by the way I honestly feel like this Terran maybe got a little bit lucky in the early game and perhaps got away with a build that shouldn't be completely viable, a really late mindrop into a really quick third CC, but he got away with it He's now trying to spend this money the best that he can He's getting quick extra upgrades, getting an armory, Ghost Academy on the way as well Pretty solid macro all around I really like the call of a fast fort base again, something like this Fast-forth base going up to 10, 8 or 10 gateways. Was this 8? So I think if you're playing a build that is so focused on minerals, it is not necessarily bad to go up to 10 gateways very quickly Because you're mining very little gas And the reason why your army is going to be good is because it's going to be big, not because your army comp is necessarily going to be strong. You kind of want to destroy your opponent with lots of zealots and Zellet run by, Zellet attacks in the main base with prisms once he moves out, maybe going into the natural with a bunch of zealot or going into the third, and the moment you meet on the map, oh, this is not a good army either, is it? No, this is really not The Stalker is a unit that you have to make, but you don't want to make, like at least in the mid-game stage against Darren There's no real purpose to the Stalker It doesn't fight very well It dies kind of easily It's nice for kiding It's nice for catching. dropping initially you can use it for solid aggression as well but in defending attacks in the midgame or going for attacks in the midgame you much rather have zealots and invest your gas into something that is way more useful and whether there's going to be a robo bay or Templar archives or just a sentry or you know the term arcons I don't know I think I already said Arcons but I said it twice like this army doesn't trade well at all against Terran armies because If there's even any amount of marauders in the Terran force, your stalkers are absolutely going to melt, and even more so if you're down in upgrades. So here, you're getting completely blasted for no real reason, except for the fact that A, you had two little gateways, and B, you decided to build 22 stalkers rather than, and like five zealots rather than the other way around Usually you see five stalkers, and then the rest is going to be zealids The rule that I would use here, 6KM, is that you want to build as many stalkers as you need to defensively And then the rest is just going to be zealots and immortals and maybe a century or so and then quicker attack Because the more stalkers you build, the less gas you have for actual good units Stalkers are a unit that keeps you alive. Loving this vision here, by the way Making sure that whenever there's an eruption of lava coming out of this, whatever Is this not really a volcano, is it? Whatever it is, this lava erupts, this volcano erupts, you have double vision of it with these observers, which is just really nice You could, for example, instead of just looking intensely at this lava, you could have an observer over here, or you could have one in this position, one in this position, and then just a zealot in the middle You'd be capable of covering pretty much the entire map Right now, despite having vision of this third base completely, you still kind of managed to miss the move out I'm not sure how it is possible. You've also been floating an insane amount of money, due to the complete lack of having extra production facilities Currently you're on eight gateways and one robotic home Interesting synchronized attack Loving the stalker flank here Didn't come quite at the same time as the zealots, but I'm sure you tried your best Yeah, you basically have the production for someone that is on three bases That's it And even on three bases, you'd probably be struggling spending your money with eight gateways and one robo Like, but you have an extra have an extra fort base that was entirely mining with 16 probes and you had a fifth on the way that is now done. Like, you had absolutely zero preparation for the money that you were getting It makes absolutely no sense at all Like so much cash coming There's no point in getting extra bases if you can't spend the money Like, then it's just an investment that doesn't really pay off at all Not a huge fan of that usually I think increasing production in general is a great, way to improve at the game Like when you're struggling, like often it is, if you're struggling spending your money, often it's a, it's a lack of production that you have DTs, okay, now this is, this is just really interesting, okay? This is really interesting because a dark shrine is one of the slowest transitional tools that there is. It takes a really long time for a dark shrine to build You also need a shadow stride, the Dark Templar blink, in order for the DTs to be very useful at this phase in the game against Darren So it's a very slow, transition and it doesn't add anything in your actual army composition While the main issue right now for 6KM is the fact that this army comp is so completely terrible, like there's nothing in here that couldn't have been built at the freaking three minute mark All of these units are pure gateway units No colossine, no disruptor, no high templar And yes, maybe on the Chinese server, this is good enough for top 100 grandmaster, but this is North America, baby. And it's different here I believe. And I'm defending North America. The one thing that I vowed not to do in my life is not become a North American fanboy and here we are. It's actually kind of painful to watch. This is also painful to watch because there's no scan yet. This defense shouldn't have worked. It upsets me. This DT run by is also not going to work. I do hope you send them away. Nice. Actually pretty quick responses. Still way too much money in the bank as well as you get a proper clean on this entire army. Terran is still just outmining you better upgrades as well. Currently 2-2 against 2-1 with 3-3 on the way. More command centers coming in as well So, yeah, overall, I still think Terran is in a good spot, especially given the fact that it's 13 or almost 13 minutes in the game You don't have a single disruptor out You don't have any colossal You don't even have a single immortal Like, your army composition crafting is some of the worst in the world because you just built zealots and stalkers Maybe 6KM only played like the first campaign mission. You know how in the campaign mission in order to help you tutorialize they usually only give you one or two types of units and it's like 6km played the first campaign mission I was like all right I like these two this is going to be my life from now on like what have we lost we have lost 57 zealads 17 stalkers one adept and then 3dt's just now not even a single sentry sentry by the way with the Guardian Shield is a hundred gas investment that allows your entire army to gain plus two armor that can't be gained from any other source. It's one of the most amazing spells, one of the most broken spells in the entire game, together with the Raven anti-armor missile These two spells are so insanely good The fact that you're not using any of this is actually quite upsetting Now we have 12 gateways, finally, that's a good amount, maybe still too low even, because you already had such a backlog of money in your bank that you couldn't really spend Not really warping in either Once again, more stalkers being warped in I'm not sure why your army is split God, I wish I could see what your hotkeys look like Because it's obvious to me you have some hotkeys Like very different types of hotkeys You have your stalkers separate. Then you have your zealot d T separate No, just your dT separate Your zealots are separate from the stalkers and separate from the DTs Maybe they're together It's so hard to say Disruptors are in the stalkers group Then you have random zealots just set up around the map Oh my god, these disruptor shots were huge, or one of them at least was pretty huge The base is still going to end up falling because half your army wasn't in position These three Zell is not doing very much of anything This seems like a massive F2 move in which every unit is going to now show up to this fight There is this is in a fight you can win? I wouldn't have thought so. God, this really is powerful if the Tos wins this Okay, never went yet This is not going with this Holy crap That was a slaughter One more disruptor shot Not bad I mean, I guess this is the fight where he said that he was laughing, that his opponent couldn't even operate the bio, but Taryn is still very far ahead right now Like 160 supply, a pretty sizable bank as well, decent enough production Seven racks, would have loved to see in eight racks here Double Starports done already Fifth base on the way I mean, this just looks fine, to be honest still with this terrible vision out of the Protos player I mean, the TOS still just has a garbage army as well. Like, I It is literally just four disruptors, that's it There is no runbyes that are happening He mentioned that the censor towers and the missile turrets really annoyed him, but He also didn't really try to do anything aggressive all game So you can't really complain about being annoyed by the sensor towers and missile turrets Especially, you know, if you park your zealot straight into a missile turret to a sensor tower range for the past minute and a half Okay, now you do have some vision Here we go This looks like a fight with no potential whatsoever 140 supply against 190s Holy crap Okay, this might have been the fight. Okay, that was a fight with no potential that went way better than it ever should have been Way, way better Holy cow Eight disruptors are out, so I'm starting to believe again Almost starting to believe again Sadly, I always know that whenever I watch an IOTIS, this is a good catch That actually was good Nice, nice awareness here I love that these two observers actually proving their value Here I was making fun of you for having two observers at the exact same place But who's laughing now? Well, still me because you would have seen the same thing with one ops, but whatever The sad thing about Iota is that I know that this Protos player is going to end up losing. But there's actually some potential These moves right now honestly aren't that bad Look at this You have some rotations coming in You have some disruptor use, maybe a little bit slow at times Maybe very slow The zoning hasn't been brilliant here at all Oh my God Just threw away like five disruptors for free That was actually really painful It's going to be like seven disruptors for free Holy crap I kind of want to go over that fight again Okay? Because that fight, the start of it went so well, and this rotation was good This is the fight where I think you could have just straighted up won the game If you do this well There's no ghost in this army. There's not a large Liberator count The army consists of a lot of metaphics And you have freaking, what is this? Seven? Seven disruptors in this army Okay So how does it start? It starts by you blinking back, sending in a disruptor shot that most likely is going to hit Your next disruptor shot should already be coming out The problem with Protos armies that don't have immortals, that don't have arcons, that don't have zealids, that don't have colossal, is that there is no backbone in this army This is an army where the only reason why the Terrant can jump on you is because you have disruptor shooting purification Nova. The moment there's not a disruptor that is threatening the life of the bio, the bio is not afraid of this army because stalkers once again freaking suck at fighting They're okay at shooting from a distance while your opponent is running away from your purification Nova or trying to run out of the colossi range But stalkers are complete garbage in a straight-up engagement So the moment there is no purification Nova active, like there is half of this fight or they're missing, you're not winning You need your opponent to be running away for your stalkers to be effective They can't be trading They need to be shooting for free I'm not sure if you ever had a. If you've ever had a bachelor party, I'm not sure if they do bachelor parties in China, like we do them in the Netherlands I would play paintball at a bachelor party And then at some point, what they do is they put the bachelor, so the fella that's getting married I'm not sure where they call him the Bachelor, but they put him in a bunny suit and they make him go around the entire paintball area And then all of his friends that are at the Bachelor party shoot at him Okay? Now, the friends of the Bachelor are very similar to the stalkers You know, they don't actually want to be shot at by the Bachelor with a paintball. They're just standing there while the guy in the bunny suit is running around It's the same with stalkers While the marauders and Marines are running away from the purestores, purification Nova, your stalkers are standing there with your paintball gun shooting at him The moment the bachelor turns around and starts shooting the stalkers, all of a sudden the bachelor party isn't fun anymore Trust me, I've tried as well So yeah, make sure that whenever your army consists of pure stalkers to always have purification Nova active, because you didn't do that, you got completely blasted here in the fight, which is a bad thing Obviously, because you got destroyed in this fight. Which is why often I prefer to at least have some type of zealots in an army because A, they're a little bit cheaper, and B, they tank relatively well against high marauder force It sucks a bit if there's ghosts nearby, but ghosts are also not great against disruptor, so, you know, it is what it is On top of that, whenever you have pure stalker disruptor, you're really forced to keep your entire army together because both of those units suck without the other They have pretty good synergy They keep each other safe in a way But at the same time, it's very vulnerable, and also you definitely can split it up. And also, the moment you're caught out of position, it's impossible to engage into a position, which is probably what you're about to find out over here, is that it's legitimately impossible that if one of your bases is under siege, that you can do anything about it whatsoever Now, these liberators are annoying, but I don't really feel like liberators have been the problem here whatsoever In this game, like, you literally just lost a massive fight over here, and you lost every single fight before this all, because you're probably building pure stalker against a bio army You're really lucky your opponent doesn't feel comfortable enough having more than half a control group. Otherwise, if there were ghost in this army again and a couple of EMPs would have hit you, you'd have been completely blasted even harder in every single fight And now we're seeing the ghost being built again Okay, now the game ends This had nothing in no, Gigi The fact that this is a no GG actually kind of upsets me because it makes me believe, that 6KM looked at this fight and thought to himself, this is reasonable for me to expect to expect a win here, basically Well, I think that is extremely unreasonable There's seven liberators There's a decent chunk of marauders There's a decent amount of Marines as well, more reinforcements coming in. And all you really have is 24 stalkers and seven disruptors I think none of these purification novas actually end up hitting And you fight consistently into the Liberator zone without moving away So you're attacking into a siege drop Actually, these purification hours were good You attack into a siege drop position You blink into marauders and liberator freedom zones And then you lose the game And then you're surprised that you lost And then you tap out without saying Gigi, which is just a little bit silly I think with your, the problem here, my friend, wasn't so much that the liberators or the marauders or what else did you complain? There was one more thing Right Censor. Tensor Towers are absolutely nothing to do with your loss I don't even want to talk about that It's just a massive cross to the Sensor Tower complaint But even the Liberators and the Marauders is like the only reason you lose the liberators and Marauders is because A, you don't constantly have purification over out to zone out the Marauders And B is because your army composition is legitimately extremely bad You just get pure stalker It gets countered by Marauders and you don't have any real backbone in your army You never build any R-Cons you never build a good amount of zealots The only time you built zealots was, I think, here on the bottom side, and then you send them in by themselves. Every single time you actually build zealots, you just kind of lost them randomly before any fighting actually happened Even in this last fight, I think you had some zealots initially up here It's like the zealots are there for tanking, and if you lose them before there are units that can actually deal damage, then the tanking just doesn't make a whole lot of sense in a way It's just like a guy getting hit It's basically, if you're a real, boxer and your only skill is being able to tank hits but you can't actually hit them back So yeah, basically what I'm trying to say is that my friend, it is you who sucks and not the marauders, liberators or censor towers that are imbalanced. And that is going to be my verdict Thank you all so much for watching I hope you enjoyed this episode If you did, don't forget hit the like button, subscribe to the channel and I'll see all of you next time for a new video Thanks so much And bye to the bye Thank you."

        "text": "Dear Harstam, Protos is imba Each unit is imbalanced, like this game I used unclear meaning construction process As long as you can't understand it, your opponent can't understand it even more I think what this guy means with this sentence is that he purposefully plays terrible build orders so that his opponent gets confused Kind of like it actually Then, in the midgame, the opponent gathers imbursed Baselots to attack, but I am perfectly defended After that, he chose to transform into a high quality army, carrier and disruptor I choose to fight him The Liberator destroys his disruptors, but not his carriers Tor also can't beat an aircraft carrier G-G My Terran versus Protos win rate is only 37% Protos will not be able to play. There is no need to play this game Now, these last few sentences made very little sense Overall, highly confusing balance complaint form The name is Iceland Race is Terran The leak is diamond at 4 5K MMR And the server is Korean Oh, yes We got a Korean diamond player at 4 5K MMR And he says that every single protos unit is imbalanced Or perhaps, he sucks Let's figure it out Now, before we truly get into it, I want to note two things In the loading screen, I saw that the opponent of Iceland is actually a 5 1 or 5 2K Korean Grandmaster Protops player So a solid, what, 6, 700 MMR above Iceland. That is going to be the first note that I will make And on top of that, there was a couple of things that confused me a little bit The way the form was written was, they were sentences, but sometimes they didn't make complete sense And it reminded me a little bit of how the chat GPT would talk to you You know, sometimes there are just sentences and words in there that don't quite belong there Then the second clue that we might actually be dealing with an AI and not a real person is the fact that Iceland's email address, the one that they need to submit on the imbalance complaint form, consists of pure numbers. Now, my theory is that is because that is his microchip number and not because for whatever reason he decided to pick a number Because I actually, I've met many people in my life I've exchanged many email addresses Not once in my entire life have I met someone whose entire email address consisted of pure numbers That makes absolutely no sense And from now on I will be treating this game as if we are watching an AI And if you're a little bit familiar with my videos, you know, then I'm not super fond of AI's I mean, Chad GPT was incapable of providing a decent build order to me. Alpha Star took like three years to figure out that oversaturating your main base with 35 workers wasn't the most optimal place So whenever we take a look at these build orders, we kind of have to keep the limitations of regular artificial intelligence in mind and that it doesn't function optimally They don't have the big human brains You know, it's a little bit different They work in different ways as well So we've got to keep that in mind Perhaps that is also like the cool creative thing that my man Islin wrote in the complaint form saying that his build order makes no sense, so his opponent doesn't know what he's doing either That's the type of logic you love to hear from a bot. And indeed, this build order makes absolutely, well, actually, this build is not that bad I actually kind of like this one Just a pretty fast helion from a marine, really quick factory, with an armory as well I'm actually kind of a fan of this build Good creativity here Double helion into mines, because we are seeing the armory, and then you just go for a four or a triple mine drop and it should be fine I even, well, do I like that we have the CC on the high ground? I actually don't The two helions should give you, oh, okay, that's a lot worse actually Yeah, that's not good doing a supply drop like this But we'll get into it later. The two Hellions should give you enough presence together with the Marine that you can clear any units that come towards your side of the map until your Widow Mines finish up And the moment your Widow Mines finish up, I mean, you can just burrow them out the ramp and your CC should be absolutely safe So, yeah, I'm not a huge fan of this, but maybe I understand it Maybe he's afraid of like a proxy gate or something like this He's lost too many times to proxy gate It's like, all right, every single time that I can, I'm going to build my CC on the high ground Now, the Supply Depot drop is always bad. A depot drop saves you 100 minerals, but an actual mule could get you 225 minerals So every time you see a depot drop, that means that someone just lost 125 minerals, although I guess you can also count the building time that the SEV has added on top of it, which I didn't do So maybe 100 minerals, but it does cost a fair amount It's really, really bad for Taron, especially in the early game It's almost an entire barracks that you can produce due to being delayed Luckily for Ice Lin, the one thing he doesn't need right now is money, because despite it only being four minutes into the game, he was already floating a solid 500 It's going to move this out. Although this matter of fact has already been damaged and we didn't quite see a repair, He's still just moving out with it straight away No, goes back, sends it across the map Not entirely sure what he wants to do with this, but it doesn't look very solid so far Not a huge fan of this build order Not a huge fan of the fact that this Helion just morphed into a hellbat eater and then didn't attack any workers Surely, if you do have a Helion, you want to kill the workers Now, I know AIs have trouble with object permanence and also kind of understanding that if something isn't in one position, that it probably is in a different position. But this is really taking the crown in bad decision making Look at this Just look at this, okay? What are we seeing here? Now, technically, phoenixes could be in three locations, logically Either the phoenixes are harassing the terran player or they are defending That leaves two locations left for the phoenixes Either they're defending the main base or they're defending the natural The hellbat in the natural sees a complete lack of phoenixes in the natural So what would the logical thing be to do is to send something in the natural. If you're not sure where the phoenixes are and you're afraid of them being in between what you could do is you drop one mine at this location, you walk it into the natural as you boost into the main You split your chances that way The worst thing to do is to boost your meta-vec into location where, according to my logic, 95% of the time the phoenixes, and in this time, in this case also an Oracle, are just going to be waiting for you Not a very fantastic move Quite a bad move, actually It's not going to get a single mine to burrow This product is quite fast Not a surprise because he's about 6, 700 MMR above Islin over here. And at this point, I would almost say that the game is completely over If you play a Thor rush, one of the most important things is to have a very high Marine count with it, and then you pull SEVs and you go ASAP The timing of this Thor rush is hot garbage There's no, no, there's still Medevac alive I was going to say there's no Medevac alive anymore, but this one's still barely alive Never mind Just died There's no Medevac alive anymore, which means that Marines can't attack So this Thor rush has already been stopped, despite it never having left the base. And Thor rushes are generally quite bad to go into a later game because Thor's are really expensive and they don't really contribute anything I mean, they're okay anti-air, but so is a cyclone and a cyclone is a lot cheaper You don't require an armory for it So in this game so far, we've seen a lot of investment into units that aren't being used whatsoever, which most of the time is not the ideal thing to do in StarCraft 2 Another Viking coming out I'm also not entirely sure if this is a macro build or an all-in It is really difficult because the Eco sucks, but the unit count also sucks So it can't really be an all-in. It can't really be a macro build either And he's taking four gases Oh He's taking four gases before infrastructure He plays Mac It is a Mac player And I should have figured it out as well That's this All the clues were there All the clues were there The imbalance complaint form made absolutely no sense The email address was an number Hey, this guy was different than other people I could have figured it out He dropped as a third depot He dropped it on top of his depot because he couldn't remember to build depots People that play Mac, play Mac for the simple reason that Mac units give more supply and thus it's easier to spend your money They're also more expensive. Mac players are basically Protos players in disguise, but then playing the human race They wish they were Protos The funny thing is, is that Mac players complain the most about Protos, despite them being the exact same thing You know, they wish they picked Propos when they were young Oh, they wished it so much Oh, they would have loved to be a Prolis player, sitting back at home, building big bulky units, winning games they don't deserve to That is the Mac player standard Aye, aye,oy, yoy, yoy This feels absolutely terrible right now here for Iceland Honestly Technically, this game is already over Except Iceland isn't aware of it yet And the reason why this game is already over is because he doesn't. meet the requirements to win a game a game with Mac has never been won a woman has never been won has never been winner at a high level and I'm going to explain this to you the it just doesn't cut the requirements it's as if imagine you're entering a competition in which the goal is to draw Donald Duck you know the Disney character and make it look as much like Donald Duck as possible everyone you know draws Donald Duck colors it in as well and you show up with a dog turd on a plate and you painted it blue the judges are not going to judge your your doctor because it is not a drawing of Donald Duck just like this game isn't an actual game you're you're not meeting the requirements of what it takes to be competitive in terran versus prolos because what it takes to be competitive in terran versus prolose is to play bio Mac simply doesn't work it's a composition that has been tested again and again by many people, and it is always shown to be incapable of winning games, at least at the higher level. Now, I'm going to assume that the same issues are still here for Mac that there are at the higher level Yes, you can win individual fights, but you can do that while having high eco, and it's also impossible to kill Protos players or close to impossible to kill Protos players Protos players really need to mess up in order to die against Mac, so you're making life extremely difficult for yourself The funny thing is that if Islin were to play bio, he probably would be lower MMR, but he'd have more potential to grow further because Mac, there's like a hard cap to where you can grow It's like a Mac glass ceiling, basically Like, you can't get through it because Mac freaking sucks. And, I mean, we're already kind of seeing it Not much has happened this game Any Mac opener always is going to be behind in supply, majority of the time Or it's going to be extremely unsafe of the way how the production works You can't get that many Marines or Marines that you do build if you build a lot of them are going to be useless How is it possible that legitimately out of the seven depots that we currently have, four of them have a hat on top of them and have like the super depot drop? That's a lot of money that has been wasted here Now we get one of the worst attacks that I've seen in a while into a Mac army. And I still believe that it's kind of okay for the Prodos, just purely based on the fact that he's upper base already, that he understands that immortals are good and okay this game is practically just over isn't it just target down some of these immortals just wait for your next round of zealots and you're going to kill 10 15 workers here and the beauty of this is that you reset a lot oh actually this is an okay defense 57 yeah even after this it doesn't matter that much you can rebuild very quickly as protels you have superior eco still you can expand to a fifth base and terran actually needs a very large amount of units to continue expanding because their defensive rotations are so slow. They just need a lot of units So there's always some units in every position Sensor towers are a great tool, but aren't being used at all Tudits aren't being used in the main base either One of the easiest ways to die with Mac is to have a zealot happen into your main a zealot warpin happen into your main base That didn't quite kick off here Now, transition is going to be triple Stargates, a fleet beacon M plus 1 We already have a Stargate Is that a second Cybercore? I love this This Proos player is actually quite good If it wasn't for that terrible fight, that he just took here, this game actually would have ended already. And you and your dog turd would have been kicked back to the lobby screen But instead, you're still in the game here, Islin Okay, let's have a look Robo Bay, good decision This pro is actually making a lot of correct calls You should have taken a fifth base already, maybe even a sixth I think double expanding against Mac is almost always worth it as well Double Disruptor is good if you see, what you call it, a high Thor count Now, I just kind of want to, also take a look at what both players have seen so far in this game. So for our Protos player, he's fairly aware of production facilities, the army composition of the opponent, the amount of bases, all of that good jazz Iceland knows nothing The last thing Iceland scouted was the fact that there were three gases, two gateways, and a Stargate That is it Not aware of any of the transitions coming in, not aware of the amount of bases How can you make a solid decision without knowing any anything in the game How can you change your unit composition based on what you scout if you don't scout? How can you stop your opponent's eco from absolutely snowballing if you never harass? You only have 67 workers, 12 minutes into the game. Your opponent could have anything from 45 workers at this point to 96 Like you haven't stopped your opponent at any point You haven't killed any workers Zero, none, Nara, Niantos You tried initially with the mind drop, but there you failed And since then you haven't tried it And you have plenty of aliens to try and get some map control, plenty of aliens to try and deal some damage There's not even cannons here Honestly, the one weakness that this Protos has is the lack of static defense and the fact that the fifth base was actually kind of late, making him economically a little bit vulnerable Maybe you even had a push-out timing here Look at this You have seven Tours, ten helbets, four liberators. Maybe you were the one, the King Arthur of Terence, the one player that could make Mac work at least one time during this transition But you didn't scout, you didn't scan, you did absolutely nothing, you defend that, and then you allow your opponent to build up an entire army again, go up to 90 freaking workers, and transition into carriers all at the exact same time Fantastic job You have to be the most passive person in the entire world You're the type of guy that gets a drink spilled on him in a restaurant and then apologizes to the waitress It's a little bit pathetic, my friend You're getting abused over here by this Protos. Fusion Corps going up on the third base, we have two how many planetaries are you building? What is this? Why are you defending your third base with two planetaries? If this is also going to be a planetary, I'm going to be really upset This just makes absolutely no sense Why would you even want to defend three like You get the third base for free You don't have to set this This is something you do once you have the fifth over here and you need to spread out your army But right now, your entire army was in this location You don't need planetaries in every single base and still leaving your main vulnerable to drops. My man is going to walk up here and see, hey, oh, well, there's a planetary, a couple of tourists there Hmm I wonder if there's a way around it Surely the main has tourists on Boom Prison flies in, 10 Zalazwarp in You instantly lose the game Literally nothing you can do anymore Your upgrades are actually very good compared to your opponent But you're still playing with a composition that is practically being hard-countered right now The Thor does get hard-countered by disruptors usually, and you don't have Vikings to deal with carriers I guess if you have a lot of Liberators. I'm not even quite sure what is the ideal comp here against Carrier Disruptor if your plan is to play Mac, because I've never seen this before Like usually it would be like Ghost Viking Maraud or Metavac, a bunch of Liberators there as well. probably going to be fine against an army like this but if your entire goal in life is to play a non-viable unit composition i'm actually i'm just not entirely sure what you what the plan should be either like if you if you put such strong limitations on yourself it's really difficult okay we are going to see a pushout now at 1450 is this the first time you actually maxed no you've been maxed here you've been maxed here okay so you basically maxed out at the 14 minute mark And then you wait it for a minute so that your opponent also gets his final carriers out Plus two is almost done for the toss. And that is the timing where you decide to actually push out I like that Okay Good call Very, very good call So your opponent is completely set up Look at these disruptors If they actually get controlled semi-decently, yeah Disruptors are so good against Thor's honestly So, so good against Thor's Just lose a couple of disruptors but as long as you lower the Thor count, say, you know, a decent amount, your carriers are going to end up winning That's always what happens And also, if you clear a lot of the halberts, a zealot warping can do the job for you, because there's nothing to really tank for the zealots Yeah, to tank the zealots with anymore. Who sets up all of the liberators in positions that aren't really fighting anything? It's an interesting call Coal disruptors is awesome It's awesome It's a good fight out of the toss, honestly Some disruptors are going to hit This This wasn't great I would love to see these liberators actually being unseed so you can fight the interceptors with them that would have helped massively because it really lowers the interceptors down significantly at a very high pace This fight honestly was actually quite good Look at this Resources lost overall is like 8K in favor for Islin right now I can't believe you're still in this game despite playing Mac You're also expanded to a fifth base I can't actually believe my eyes. You're almost winning with Mac against someone that's 700 MMR higher than you You're playing a completely nonsense build order with like some weird Thor rush which you don't actually attack with Then you play a non-viable unit composition in which you hit a timing that is 50 seconds delayed And you're still I'm not sure if you're ahead, but you're alive I mean something out yet? Okay, you're now aware of the fact that there's a third base Not aware yet if there's gases or not I guess you have figured out your opponent's unit composition as well, but I don't actually think you care I think your entire play from the start was to go into Thor Hellbad, Liberator, and then eventually add Battlecruisers. Like, there's no countering here. Your unit comp doesn't change based on what you scout. Your unit comp changes based on what time it is in the game, just like with most AIs. Most AIs, they just have like a progression level you know they start with links in the early game the three minute mark they get some roaches at a five minute mark they'll start they'll start adding in some other units you're like one of the very primitive AI still that's what you are here iceland beep boop fifth base is up a raven now i know for sure you're not a real terran human because there is no terrans in the world that would admit to a raven being useful in the late game despite them being useful they're very, very good and I would compliment you on this play, but it also immediately supports my theory that you're not actually a human. Because there's, Terrans have a single control group You can't have battle cruisers and liberators and Helions and Thor's and a Raven You need more than one control group It's not possible Do we have any upgrades here for this? You have ship weapons level one flying around Honestly, still somewhat a viable game here for you It just Oh, didn't blink away It kind of Oh, there's no blink No wonder it didn't blink away It still kind of pisses me off that you haven't tried to harass once with Helions A lot of these bases would have actually been quite vulnerable to Helions. Like if you just run around them rather than running into the cannons, even here, if you go towards the left side, you could actually kill a lot of workers And if you done it a bit earlier, it's maybe one of the ways you can win is you take a very good fight and your opponent doesn't have the Eco to rebuild Yeah, then you can actually win the game Oh, this is a cool move He attacks the Rockstar to then try and go into this What's happening here? Why these BC is dealing so much damage? This is a cool move, by the way This is actually a really nice move here out of Islin This is good. Completely tricking the Protos player into going to the bottom right with a simple 2 BCs, then teleporting top left while also pushing out with loads of Thor's And then taking out this base This was a very good move Now, an even higher level play is then if your next BCs go to the far bottom right again the moment this army moves away So that way you're killing two bases still You're going to get this one for free and then either your BCs are going to get a kill here or you're not going to get attacked and you know it for sure. I almost feel like that if you hold the next push, which seems somewhat impossible, you're going to be in a good spot There are three to two, two upgrades BCs are just getting owned, aren't they? Freaking Voidraiser are really not that bad Who? Liberators, though Look at an interceptor count It's not actually going down at all Still lots of this I feel like the Protos really just kind of figured out that Mac at this point isn't a viable composition To be fair, with the amount of time that Islin gave to our Protos player, Protos probably could have just tapped down and looked for some guide online Like, hey, how do I beat Mac? Because Islin decided to absolutely do nothing with his lead. I'm a huge fan of that Third base died It's like, ah, okay So, gave my opponent a lot of time He crafted the perfect army, took out my base Let me see if I can keep everything everything together and then just have a better fight despite absolutely nothing changing Another raven on the way? You think we'll ever see an anti-armor missile? I'd love to see that Or just interference matrixes That would be the sickest thing A terran that actually uses like 10 interference matrices on an entire air army would be so cool That actually would be super sick A couple of scans I love that he's scanning around the map right now right now Yeah, it's just going to lose his base again. His army is just garbage It actually, I don't understand how you got to this level by playing Mac just straight Thor's every single game It legitimately makes no sense And I love that he kind of tried to deflect criticism of that move already by saying he played a nonsense build order So there's opponent also, this is not how it works It's like saying at the start of a football match that you're going to score in your own goal to confuse the opponent It's like, yeah, they might be confused, but they're also just up It's like confusion is only good if it's followed up by, you know, something strong. If you knock yourself out in the first round in boxing, your opponent is really confused, but you're also knocked out Like, I can draw infinite analogies with real-life situations here that would confuse the opponent, but would also just be bad Walk into a Starbucks, buy a drink, pay for it, throw it on the floor Starbucks barista is going to be insanely confused, but you're without coffee Do you want more? I could keep going all day Going to the grocery store, grab a bottle of milk, smash it on the floor, then punch all the wine bottles in your side and break them You're probably going to get arrested. But I bet both the police officer and everyone working in that grocery store are going to be extremely confused Good job Confusion isn't a positive Just because someone else is confused doesn't mean that's necessarily, a good situation Oh my god, this is a sick fight That did Now that was confusing and almost worked But then again it didn't Maybe because eight of your tours weren't, you know, weren't really in the fight Maybe because you had slightly too many liberators But you almost got your opponent And I'm kind of proud of that Now the game is completely over You're flying over with a command center From over there I mean, Tosius has too much money Overall resources lost is now even as well. So after ProDos realized how to fight, I think this game pretty much ended Gigi gets caught I'm happy to see that I guess most bots are capable of typing out Gigi So maybe not too surprising But yeah, it is a ridiculous game I don't even know what to say How can you say that every single unit is imbalanced? If you've been training perfectly fine in this game with freaking Thor Hellbad Liberator, until your opponent got the exact counter against that composition, you didn't change your comp once You just continued playing this same thing Like, I think in this case, you seriously just, you're just not allowed to complain at all You don't deserve it, my friend You just do not deserve it. You suck Prado's is an imbalance And that's my verdict here today That is going to be it as well for this video Thanks all so much for watching I hope you to enjoy this game If you did, don't forget to the like, subscribe to your channel, and hopefully I'll see all of you next time for a new video Thanks so much And bye-bye Thank you."

        "text": "Dear Captain, I play ProDos because I'm a gentleman and because I want to feel like I've actually earned my wins If I try a dumb strategy and it doesn't work out, I generally just lose the game However, Terrans can do whatever strategy they want and then Turtle behind their core three base setup for an insane amount of time My opponent had no business being in this game, but because of Terran's ability to Turtle eventually grinded it out to a victory I played bad in the early game, I walled for the wrong matchup, supply blocked myself on my second pylon and lost four probes to the Reaper. I managed to spot a strange move out of Marine Meneavec Marauder and navigated that engagement to a healthy lead While working down a small float of excess minerals, I managed to supply block my opponent and then devastate his economy with constant drops, all while improving the quality of my standing army Instead of leaving like an honorable gentleman, my opponent turtles in his three-base setup with tanks behind walls and on the high ground I probably could have killed him three different times, but with my imperfect knowledge and the understanding that a turtling terran can trade extremely efficiently, it was difficult to make that call. After being stuck in his base for the entirety of the mid-game, my opponent is three bases to my five and manages to navigate to a victory while I'm transitioning into carriers They should have never been in this game, but Terran's ability to Turtle is so strong that they had fate the whole time they could still win It's not fair So Captain, is Terran truly imba? Or do I just suck? Dassem Race Protos in the Diamond League on the North American server And the question here is very simple Is Terran truly imbalanced? Or does he suck? All righty, friends, here we go Dasem Ulthor versus Miko is going to to be our match. And Dossum Ulter is the person we're looking at our Protos player that struggles oh so much with the Terran race for whatever reason, mainly because of the camping, from what I understood A weird opener out of the Terran Now sure, Dossum Ulter messes up a little bit in the early game And he was very honest about this as well I appreciate that You know, too often I get these emails I get these forms filled in Of people saying, oh, Harsham, I played the perfect game I've never played better No one in the world has ever played better No one does it better than I do And then I see the game and their course 35 seconds late and they forget their nexus. They don't build a single probe And it's all garbage My man Dossam Ulter says, you know what, Kevin, I am not perfect I'm a human just like you And is that a bad thing? No Yes, I lose a couple of workers to a Reaper Sure I can't remember what matchup it is And yes, my build order is probably garbage But I still manage to get ahead And I believe that when I get ahead, I'm allowed to to win But against Terrence, you're never allowed to just straight up pick to win Terrence can always fall back on that nasty, nasty, three-based turtle style with tanks, with a good little choke Moon Dan's beautiful choke, by the way, look at that. Bam, bam, that is hardly any structures you need to build there in order to get that full wall going here And even if you don't have a wall, it's already a very tight choke, difficult to attack into And I'm already empathizing here with my man Dassem Dasum, you know, he struggled here And I can feel that I definitely can feel that Nexus actually at a normal timing, core actually at a normal timing RECalls the probe as well, a high-level move, very high-level move Correct move as well, if you believe you're going to lose it Did recall it a little bit too early, probably could have walked away, but we're going to forget about that here for a second Gas goes down. The actual early game build order here, the order of things is correct the timing isn't quite correct I mean, this adapt is going to start at 212 because of a supply block That is about 12 seconds too late That would have been significant if this Reaper was in time But for whatever reason, the Reaper also is 5 or maybe even 6 seconds late So this is a diamond level game And Dossum doesn't say that it isn't Dossum said that it is You know, I said, yeah, this ain't perfect Okay, this is really not perfect Perfect There's some interesting adept moves over here Losing four workers here seems more difficult than losing no workers Oh my god Feels like every shade is a miss. That is actually impressive That is actually very, very impressive Literally every single shade He just missed it And didn't even get the Reaper in the end here Reaper got the full tour of the base, got every single bit of information that he ever needed, and then balks out alive Now, I've seen a lot of bad Reaper defenses, but this definitely takes the cake This was really, really, really poor This was actual garbage And he really didn't understate how bad he was in the early game Did he scout here? What does he get? Okay, seize the barracks, nothing else yet Has a stalker Oh, man, Miko has pretty decent Reaper control I'm gonna be real here. SCV production probably hasn't been brought, and the build order also is really terrible. A double Tech Lab, double marauder production is not good. Especially not if you're going to concussive first. All of this does get scouted, but he's Desim is already playing blind Robo. So this is oh wait, blink into Robo. I still think this is practically a free win just because of how bad Miko's build is. You just build any amount of units here. And you, like, this is the type of build you hold accidentally, you know? This is not on purpose. This is if a mosquito is bothering you in your sleep, you roll over and you crush them with the weight of your body. It's like, you didn't even know there was a threat to your blood coming and you just held it This type of push can be held like this If you just have any, any normal type of build order, you're going to hold However, After scouting it, Dossum decides to throw down two more batteries It's an interesting call Because technically here, he's fighting a fictional threat There is nothing coming for him that could do any real damage Once you have your immortal health and a single battery, you're fine This is like watching the Twilight movies and then starting to eat like 20 cloves of garlic every single day for the rest of your life. It doesn't really help because, like I said, you're fighting a fictional threat and you're just going to smell pretty bad I do believe that if you eat a lot of garlic, that the smell kind of oozes from your sweat and from your skin It's really not a good type of smell 20 gloves of garlic is a lot as well I would really not recommend that Believe it that that can be good for you, 20 gloves of garlic Not good for your personal relationships, but also just health-wise I know garlic's supposed to be healthy, but you can probably die if you eat 20 gloves of garlic of garlic every single day I would not recommend it And that's what you're doing here Triple battery. I would also not recommend that Single battery here would have been enough Would have liked to see a robotic facility being thrown down because robotic facility against three racks openers is 100% the correct call if you're planning on playing blink into Robo anyway Third base is kind of late for a standard game, but you made this a weird game and not a standard game due to the triple batteries Now you move out on the map because you have the vision there what the observer I kind of like that, but at the same time, you're really exposing your main base. What would have happened here if Miko would have just picked up two of these metaphics dropped into the main base? You would have had absolutely nothing in position Your stalkers were on the wrong side of the fence in that case, and your immortals and zealots, well, you don't even have charged yet It's not going to be capable of cutting it Recalling into a drop with stalkers is also something I usually don't recommend So this was a move that actually had a bunch of risk involved there There was definitely a lot of risk and you didn't really cover your bases there Luckily, that didn't happen, but it's still important to point out Was that a triple stim? Like a double stim? Oh my God. Miko is very keen here on getting stuff done Look at this This is the cleanest hold in the world The super battery by itself would have been enough Like, I don't think any of the energy of the next two batteries is going to get used Hardly any He's like 27 energy right now That's about it Could have had more units It was all floating a magnificent amount of money here Look at that Oh my God It's like a mutual fund manager over here This guy He's rich Oh boy Now, hold that thought What is this? It's an interesting micro This is the type of micromanaging that I really like You know, this entire interaction. I just kind of want to go into first person for the Protos here So Protos right now is on four gateways, has a robotics facility and is floating 1,800 minerals 1,800 minerals, okay? If we translate that into supply, and then we always pick the zealot as a unit, you could warp in 18 zealots That means you could have 36 extra supply Now, of course, you don't have the production for that So maybe it's like four gateways, and then what is it, like a bunch more zeal Maybe you're going to end up adding 20 supplies to this army if you macro well It's definitely possible that right now you would be at 90 supply. Instead of trying to spend any of that money, what does Dassem Ulter do over here? Look at we're going to watch it at half-time speed Look at this Ooh, yeah, in the dead space, picking up stalkers, removing the damage output from the stalkers Like, what is this micro even doing? I don't even, this is not micro, this is just clicking very rapidly at things I want to go over this again because this is hilarious to me Like, there is no actual micro that is being done here Like, he's just picking up, he blinks forward Then he picks up two full health stalkers. So he lowers the actual damage output of this army, allowing the terran to get more shots off with the tanks and the marauders Then look at the following move over here Then starts dropping the weak stalkers Picks up the healthy stalkers, starts dropping the weak stalkers He's absolutely fabulous This is the type of high-level move that you just don't see at the Grandmaster level anymore. Because a grandmaster would have looked at the bank, thought to himself, maybe I just aim of this fight, it's probably better than what Dossum did here, and I probably have to just add six gateways and a fourth base and a fifth base at the same time, and start a fleet beacon and two stargates, and then still we float in cash, because holy crap, is he rich? And just like in regular life, you never actually want to have money in the bank Any good money manager, if that's a word, money managers will tell you that They'll tell you you don't want to have money back You want to have it in your index funds, in your buy property with it for all I care. Or, of course, you can invest in the very volatile cryptocurrencies But not so volatile if you invest into Harcoin Roll the tape Harcoin is a cryptocurrency based on blockchain neural networks, which explored a natural dichotomy between men and robot I invested all my hard-earned cash into it and already made over 200% returns on my investment in just the past three days If you too never want to work again and let your money do the working, be sure to invest in hard coin And soon your life could be like mine, spending all of your free time on hobbies, like playing guitar Sounds absolutely great, Kevin, and that could be you in a Hawaii shirt playing guitar. Man, smoke on the water, never sounded so good before Harcoy for all your blockchain needs Say it, Dossam The choice is for you Where do you want to invest it? Loads of pigs I'd go for the harcoin because good Lord, that guy could play some guitar and he can only do that due to the hard practice that he's been capable of putting in Now, this game, despite every single mistake that Dussam has made in this game, still looks very good for Dossum I mean, he has a bank that he can eventually, hopefully, use for something It's getting extra gates, getting a nexus down, robotics bay as well, which I think is a good call We're lacking gas in a big way. I mean, we technically are on four gas, but we're only mining off Look at this, what is this? We're only mining off half a gas Like one gas total, maybe But one and a third, I guess, technically We're going to get real annoying about it Still 2K in the bank Classic 2K bank Love to see it Third base on the way for Miko Third base is slower, actually, than the Protos 4th base So, Proz in It's actually so far ahead right now I think it might be impossible to lose this game If I look at this, if I look at this game, I don't really see a way for the toss to lose. You always kind of got to think, what is the worst thing that could happen here? Maybe like a drop into the main base could go very wrong There's not a lot of vision on the map, right? So this is one of the things actually If you're ahead, you kind of just have to go in your head over the things that you could lose against So it's like, okay, if I get caught out of position and I lose a base, that would be really bad for me. So you want to get a little bit of map vision, right? Is there any unit comp that I could potentially struggle with you should consider? It's like, okay, my opponent gets ghost and I don't have a solid, consistent way of dishing out splash damage I might be in trouble So you're getting Colossi already, second robotic facility as well I think those are actually very good calls And I think that that probably lowers the risk of you losing an unloosable game You could also say, hey, I'm not great at getting map control Maybe I'm just going to put four or five stalkers in my main base I'll put a battery. I'll add a cannon in there as well and I'll be safe in my main I think that is genuinely not a terrible call I'm loving this harassment as well, A, because it's harassment and it can deal some damage, but B, it also scouts your opponent It sees, hey, what is my opponent actually doing? Here we go, double drop heading towards the main I think this is really common for Terrans to do if they're behind But I mean, you're also dealing so much damage Look at this 34 workers here 33 workers 31 workers Again, 62 And you have plenty of units in position, loads of gateways as well. This is a good enough defense, I think, that this game is becoming less and less likely for me to see the comeback happen One one Okay, maybe upgrades I guess that that is the final thing There is a world in which the Terran maxes out on 18 workers and 2-2 upgrades No, but we already have upgrades on the way Yeah, I don't actually see a way here for the Tarrant to win Like, I feel like a lot of the boxes are being checked right now, and the only box that isn't checked is the drop box Like, we're lacking some vision on the map That's about it We have very good vision of what our opponent is doing here 17 workers against 68. This feels like a close to impossible game to lose Army supply is quite close, so I guess there is a timing right at this moment There's one ghost, two more on the way, and there's three callsai There's no timing here There's also 10 gateways And we have a fifth base on the way with cannons coming up That's a good call That's definitely a good call I mean, you have an observer as well, so you see when a major moveout happens and you're building disruptors after triple colossi Theory-wise, this is actually a pretty solid play The only thing that Decim is lacking is vision Is vision on the edges? That's it. And it's the only thing I can see here that could potentially go wrong Six racks, seven wrecks for the Terran Weird builder, by the way Okay, here we go Big Stim Ford No scan All these This marines just going to get absolutely blasted These marines are going to get, yeah, this is not it Nah, it's too many colossus It's too many colossus There's too many units there in general Also, two immortals are This is just a really powerful army, honestly It's a Like, at this point, you can just aim of and straight up win the game There's obviously nothing that Terran can do about There's three tanks. tanks are not that good against zealots though you can aim move or you can get 2-2 and go up to 6 bases you don't have to attack into it i mean if your opponent stays on 3 base forever on 28 workers like you could just add more and more gateways and better upgrades you do need to attack eventually but you're so far up it really doesn't matter could also scout ahead with the observer to see what's actually going on This army isn't big enough to defend this But even if you don't see that, then there's still like 50 options that you can go for That would be completely okay I like the plus two attack I like the plus two armor. Fifth base is up and running Don't want to get more than 77 workers I don't think so at least I like the thought of just staying on 77, 76, 75, something along those lines You can have a large army and you're also creating a bank way faster than your opponent Now here comes a double drop out again There's already cannons in position Double drop into three cannons and two batteries is simply just not going to be enough And 60 Marines also get spotted by these salads And you can just send your units over there Yeah, this is no issue Fusion Corps being constructed Is this for BCs or for Liberty? Why is this Terran actually staying in? You know, I wasn't upset initially. I thought that Desham was just meming and said, okay, you know, my opponent is supposed to leave when I get ahead But in this case, yeah, I'm actually feeling Desham What did he say exactly here? My opponent had no business being in this game, but because of Terran's ability to Turtle eventually grinded it out to a victory I kind of agree This Terran has no business being in this game right now There's legitimately no chance, but people like Dasum Ulthor apparently give this Terran hope because we know that Dossam Ulter eventually is going to lose. And I bet that Miko has played games like this before, where people like Dossam Ulta are too stupid to transition in time or are too dumb to get the correct unit comp or take an absolutely atrocious fight, giving Miko the win But right now I'm having a very difficult time seeing how it's going to occur Stargate transition I kind of like the Stargate transition here as well. 2-2 upgrades halfway done i mean you're going to be up in upgrades you're going to be up in tech you have static defense everywhere you're maxed out all that we need to do right now is at like six more gateways or more star gates yeah this is this is completely fine this is completely correct there's even cannons in the main base already as well you have zela drumbys being set up honestly you're playing a very solid game here dussum a very solid game game Is there no thermal lens? Oh, there's no thermal lens Okay, that's kind of a big error Not having thermal lens is always bad, usually I have needs to watch the kit Tough luck, buddy. More important things going on right now Do you really think you can win? This guy's a bit of a prick This guy's a massive prick Yep Okay, Miko is delusional So that is how he loses So that is how he loses Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Very funny, Dossum Ultour Let's send a replay to YouTube man and write a nice little story So YouTube man gets tricked into reading my form And YouTube Man uses two fantastic or maybe three fantastic anecdotes on your game And then I leave the game and my opponent doesn't actually win And YouTube Man is going to be confused and I beat the system. No, my friend, you didn't beat the system The system is about to beat you Because you are going to get a suck stamp But Hamster, wait with it Ah, shit Now I need to fix it Kevin! Where's the glue? A few moments later All right, should be good enough I know you're usually a bit trigger-happy with that suck-stamp hamster, but here we have to hold off Because usually we give a suck-stamp to people because they're not good at the game But you actually played a fine game You played well You outplayed your opponents You won Congratulations, Desham I hope you're happy with yourself But you still get the suck stamp because you suck as a human being. wasting my time, wasting everyone's time, and being a dick, the poor old Miko Miko doesn't feel like he deserved this win He's going to watch the replays like, oh, I didn't want this win He'll feel dirty getting this MMR And it's because you, my friend, suck as a person Hit it Hamster Twice Trice Four times All over that form Perfect If you're sitting at home and you're thinking to yourself, ha ha, very funny, Dassem I bet I could also pull a prank on YouTube man Don't do it I'm not interested in it This was a one-time thing And people like Dassem is not okay Okay? I do not approve of this The last time we're doing this This is the last time. Next time I'm sending an angry email and making sure that this won't happen again. Come on you, Protoss. If you do, however, have a replay where you truly believe that something was imba, then be sure to let me know In the comment section, no, in the description, there's a form that you can fill in You can send it over and we'll have a look at it and we'll figure it out together Thanks so much for watching. Hope you to enjoy this If you did, smash like and subscribe I'll see you next time. Bye-bye Thank you."

        "text": "How can a single unit be able to dominate everything on the ground and be balanced? Upgrades don't matter to it Army size doesn't matter to it I did some good early damage, had decent macro for my level I was ahead in upgrades He nearly crumbled to my timing attack Yet, on defense and offense, just because of the lurker, he wins the game I feel robbed I had full control of the game for the longest time, but as soon as this one unit comes out, my entire lead goes up in smoke I only get a few games a day after work, but seriously, losing like this repeatedly is crushing my soul. Lurkers are not honorable, and I hope everyone that wins like this feels bad Now, all that there is left to answer is, is this unit just Inba? Or do I suck and should consider retiring? Name, go to you death Race Protos, Leakmaster, 4 3K MMR on the European server And the question is very simple Is the lurker imba? Or does he suck? And we're here to find out All right Here we go Tropical sacrifice Go to you death versus a Zirk barcode player And the Zerk barcode player starting with this is not an ideal hatch timing This is, this is, this, okay, this is, usually we don't criticize the people that don't send in the replay, but this is not it. My man, Zirko over here, build a hatchery at 19 supply while floating 200 minerals on top of the already 300 that he was having in the bank to build a hatchery, which means he could have built a pool first and then a hatchery The pool would have been like, what, 40 or 30 seconds faster than now, and the hatchery would have still been at the same time, or even earlier, because usually you're not even supposed to do any of this at 19 supply A hatchery usually at the natural goes down at 16 supply, and if you build it at the third base, at 7 team supply. But for whatever reason, everything got delayed, you know, Zirk player got a little bit greedy like Zirk players usually do And, well, now we're going for some triple hatch as well 20, 20 hatch on the third base This is not a very good build But we're not here to look at the Zerk player Of course, we're here to look at Go to You Dad, who also reinvents the early game of the Protos Look at this Completely unique game I often mention chess And for the people I don't know In chess, whenever a game hasn't been played before, isn't in the database yet, they usually call it a completely unique game. So for example, someone plays like a pawn to, I don't know, like E4 or something, and then they play some pawn moves, and then boom, all of a sudden, a knife moves like an idiot, boom, it's a unique game like that Now, this game, if you compare it to chess, would be more like, if you know, both players use the first pawn, and then the second guy takes out a flame thrower and burns the chess board Technically, it's a completely unique game, but also this isn't entirely the way that chess is supposed to be played And that's the same that we're seeing here Like, this cybernetic score legitimately just finished, what was this? Like, 45 seconds too late. I'm not even quite sure how that is possible But I think this score went down at 23 supply after a second pylon and a second assimilator, which just delays your tech for no real reason So, yeah, I don't really quite get it But, oh wow, fast forge has a follow-up as well Right in vision That is just beautiful I really wants to rush out those cannons, I guess Also has failed the wall here at the front Did he say that he had a good early game? I recall reading that he felt that his early game was decent and that his opponent almost crumpled under the pressure Yeah, let's have a look at this early game then A depth coming in. What is this build, are there? This is a true abominate This is a true abomination Good Lord Forge Twilight before third Single Void Ray Did he lose his adapt yet? No, it went back home Single Void Ray into Forged Twilight, pre-third base And then a second gate that isn't in the wall, but a star gate that is in the wall So whenever a Zerk wants to, they can scout what Stargate units you are building I don't think a single thing so far in this game has been correct, which is kind of surprising because this is 4 3K, but this build order actually is giving me big bronze vibes This Nexus is delayed by a solid 40 seconds. So it's not like he got a better eco by delaying his stack for also 40 seconds, or just delaying everything by 40 seconds, I guess Maybe it's a little bit slow There's only one person that's going to be happy with the 40 second delay, and that's going to be his girlfriend but everyone else is just kind of confused This overlord is going to get taken out No Oh wait, he already used the prismatic alignment earlier I guess on an earlier overlord, interesting call We're now getting this third base What battery position as well It's not really covering the mineral line at all. Usually you build a pylon over here and battery in the mineral line and you cover and the mineral line and you cover the units there in between your pylon and the nexus And on top of that, it makes it really easy for you to make like a semi wall over here or a full wall in this general area But so far none of that is happening yet What is the follow? Okay, we're working off of two gases Two gas What's this? Six gate? Five gate Two gas, five gate Still no wall, which is impressive So at any point, the Linkflot would have killed. How did this void ray get this much damage on? I kind of hope that it dies because it really doesn't deserve this much damage I just want to see this move again, because this is one that astounds me So he looks at this void ray right now Microring the void ray, microing the void ray, warping in salads, moving it back One Okay, you see the attack right now? That was at 541 on the mini map, we saw it When does he realize? Does he look over? Or did he realize already? Are he still waiting for his void rate to come on? I'm not sure if he knows that his void raid just died It is so difficult sometimes. Maybe just thinks it's in the corner or something These two queens never should have gotten that kill But I'm quite happy with it Now, let me just punch this build a little bit more because this makes absolutely no sense This is poor Eco and also a poor attack We're going for a plus one charge timing, which is going to hit at a regular, timing of a charge lot arcone timing that can be done with two oracles This was done with a single void ray and that that build would also have better eco It would have six gas already, 66 probes most likely, maybe one less gateway, but we also already have two arcons. And with that type of push, you 100% would win the game Honestly, with this push, you're also 100% going to win the game because your opponent literally has no units whatsoever There's currently five queens and four links out There are, what is this? 11 zealids with plus one This is completely game Like, this is 100% game right now You can right click the hatchery You can right click the drones You probably can do both things at the same time, but I don't think it's possible to lose this Behind this, you could macro up Blink is an interesting call One that we don't see very often This is something that Hero perhaps could play, but Hero always gets oracles as well. And he would already have a fort base done at this point if that was his actual plan We get the Zealot attack It actually runs it away I like this attack You know what? I thought this was going to go terribly and he was going to accidentally lose all the zealots for free in the end, but it actually ended up going pretty okay Delt a lot of damage to this hatchery, ended up forcing these drones away from mining for a long while Sure is floating a little bit of money behind this, but I mean, who hasn't floated 1,200 minerals in their prime? I sure have There have been many games where I've floated this much money. Do I like the fact that we're going up to four gases on three base that we're playing a that we're playing a pure gateway unit army, despite fighting a Roach Hydra-type army Yes, I don't actually like that very much I also don't like the fact that there's no gases on our natural, despite it already being seven minutes in the game, and the Ford Nexus also not being rushed out yet That is not entirely brilliant, but honestly, I don't think it really matters This game is so insanely over that losing this is going to be a bigger achievement than winning this. Because let's face it, there's 11 hydras, four roaches, without any upgrades against a complete Protos army that can be reinforced with a prism that has an upgrade, has a plus two on the way, with a Protos player that is up 11 workers, actually up two upgrades right now, plus two has finished as well, this game is literally unloosable at this point, okay? This is the time in a movie where the villain is so sure that he has won the game that he starts explaining his plan to the protagonist, okay? That is where we're currently at you death currently is our villain And the barcode is the protagonist Now, go to you that could have done a million things here. Okay? He could have scouted if there was a fort base He could have tried tacking into something else He could have started building cannons because, let's face it, he's playing against a Zirk player that has stuck on 56 workers, on four gases, without any upgrades Yes, this Zerk is all-inning And what do you usually do against an all-in? If you have better upgrades, more eco, and probably, does he have a robo? If a robo also probably kind of superior attack already, you just defense, sit back and the moment your opponent moves out, you counterattack with a prism or with a zealot warpin, a run by, towards their third base There is no reason for you to attack into your opponents all in. Your opponent is about to all in, all in to you All you need to do is receive it You don't have to, you know, get out there on the street, wave at him and then fight him on the street No, you have a superior position already, let's just keep that position No need to throw away all of your units And that's pretty much what GoTo-U death is doing here And probably is also the only real way of potentially losing this game is by not capitalizing on the current lead And just tacking into a superior unit that can never be countered Whether that would be the disruptor or disruptor into carrier or Storm or Colossus even at this point. point, honestly, like literally anything would have been better than throwing away stalkers into a Roach Hydra composition But then again, I am not go to you death This has actually been a very, very poor performance But I am not worried at all We're 72 workers We're still upgrading, which actually, Go to You Dead has been doing extremely well, despite his poor early game build order in the first two minutes, despite his poor follow-up in minute 2 till 5, and then his garbage attack that he just managed to do, he did do a pretty decent job here with the upgrades, so I'm kind of happy about that, honestly I feel good about these upgrades. Plus 3, we have the Glaves I'm not so sure about I've never seen Glaves being useful in a late game, but still don't completely mind it Do we have any minor arrest being set up? Is there any scouting going on as to what our opponent could potentially be doing? We could be seeing the double hatchery in the main, maybe scout if there's a hive yet or not, and maybe you could see what type of units are being pumped out I like the call here of a Robo Bay I think this Rupter definitely counters everything that is out currently, and it's just a really, really good call. So despite all my earlier reservations, Go to UDet is still in a position where I'd say he has about a 95% to 98% chance of winning I think if you were to give disposition to any pro gamers, I actually think the win rate for pros would be closer to 100% than to 99 Now that I look at this I mean, TOS is up 20 supply, has better upgrades, has complete map control, up in bases There's literally nothing worse for the TOS in this current game, except maybe the unit composition Okay, the TOS unit composition is really bad, 25 zealots and 17 stalkers But the ZERC composition is honestly worse like a freaking 14 roaches I just had it open. 14 roach and 15 hydras Like that's not very good either And I don't even really mind an attack here I'll have go to you that, but I would love for the attack to be multi-pronged So for zealots over here, the third base, Prism with 10 zealots in the main base And then you just kind of stand outside of this general area, pretending to run up this ramp And you're basically killing the bases and the drones of the opponent And then wherever he sends the units, that is where you run away So he goes into your main to deal with the prism, you fly the prism away It goes to deal with your run by, you run the run by away. Goes to deal with your army, you run your army away Or you can fight in the middle in a good position Like you basically just want to be out on the map with the ability to run by, with the ability to kind of dance with your opponent's army, either with disruptors, with immortals, or just with, for all I care, glaive adepts You know, I don't like this as a run by, but I like this more than not having a run by So if you shade in 10 adepts the moment your opponent moves out, I'm okay with that move, my friend I'm completely okay with that What I'm not okay with is not tacking at all into something else. And then letting your opponent get up to some pretty vital units, like vipers and lurkers And in combination, these actually are kind of scary against the pure ground army I'd like to get, well, most of the time I like to get just Storm Immortal, and if you're on the map, you're usually fine But in some cases, getting carriers is a good call So I like that we're seeing a Stargate transition here. go to you that is going for that Stargatter's and has the adepts as well shading in look at that one lurker actually this is like five lurkers dealing with this at the same time we have a push here so one run by got taken out no prism in the main base which is definitely a mistake here come the viper without really any energy though so should it be too big of an issue but they have been spotted okay this base is going to end up dying and you still leave a safe retreat for yourself purification of it didn't really hit anything maybe not the end of the world though Okay, you've scouted now, you know what your opponent has. You can continue building Disruptors, you can warp in some Templar, while continuously going into Carrier. The one thing you shouldn't do here, go to you that. The one thing you shouldn't do is moving back completely home. It is so important that your opponent does not get the setup aggressively in front of your bases, okay? You need to see the Lurker army, my dear friend, as a tank, as a Tank army. How would you play against Tank Marine? How would you play against Tank Marine? If there's 35 tanks outside of your fourth base, there's no way you're breaking that. Unless you have air units or, no, actually just unless you have air units. The way that you deal with that is by never letting it get to your base And against tanks and lurkers, that is very possible because these units don't shoot unless their siege This time this lurker player doesn't even have seismic spines or adaptive talent, so neither of the lurker upgrades And you also have the ability of course to transition into carriers, which is absolutely great I just want to pull up a quote that I remember from the balance complaint What did it say again? How can a single unit be able to dominate everything on the ground and be balanced? How can a single unit be able to dominate everything on the ground? This unit dominates everything on the ground. Okay? Let's just keep that in mind here for a second If a guy would come up to you and tell you that tomorrow a 200 kilo absolute gorilla of a man, the best MMA fighter in the world, great at wrestling, great at standing fighting, a brilliant kickboxer, is going to beat you up What are you going to do? Are you going to go home and think to yourself, hey, let me train some MMA? No, of course not You're not going to be able to compete with this gorilla of a man What you do is you buy a gun and you shoot him And that's what you should be doing here. If you truly believe that there's nothing that can compete with the lurker on the ground, then why in the world does your entire army consist of pure ground units? I don't necessarily agree with the premise But if I were to agree with the premise that the lurker gets beaten by nothing on the ground, wouldn't it make sense for you to transition into carriers as quickly as you could, or into Tempice or into Mass Voidre or any air unit, the moment you have the chance, the moment you scout your opponent has lurkers? You're showing me right now with your unwillingness to try transition into air that you don't actually believe that this unit can be beaten on the ground. You think it can be beaten on the ground But you just believe you're incapable, or you are just incapable Because why else would you try? You've seen other people do it so you know it's possible Otherwise, why would you do that? If you truly believed what you said, you wouldn't be out here building zealots and more disruptors and going for ground upgrades No, you'd be throwing down five more stargates and pumping out carriers at a high pace you're not a man that believes in your own worth Someone that doesn't believe in their own worth What can they believe? If not even themselves Kevin the coin, 2023 That's a quote. On one of these posters, you know, the old meme templates that they used to make? And people had deep quotes I'm one of those Why does no one make those for me? An editor Never makes one for me Unbelievable Yeah This is the one thing that I said shouldn't happen is allowing your opponent to siege in between three vital bases with a powerful siege unit Okay? The funny thing is, is that a lot of Protos players, they complain about the Lurker What they don't realize is that this is us against Taryn. If I position myself in between three Tarran bases with nine disruptors, which functions fairly similar as Lurkers, I would absolutely destroy every single Tarran, unless they get like the perfect surround from five angles And the same wood is here The one thing you can do is come with a surround from ten different angles Or you could have a unit that flies A bird, perhaps a carrier, that carries interceptors A bunch of them You could have had upgrades for them Or you could have shot this ruptors the moment your opponent was walking up this teeny tiny ramp There was a lot of options here But instead you decided to be out of position and not have an army that you believed in. You had an army that you didn't believe in That's sad, my friend What is these drones doing? It's like backpacking drones, you know? It's like people that believe they've seen everything in their own country already And they're going to some country far away to sleep in a cheap hostel And then explore the world They could have done that in their own backyard as well It would have been a lot cheaper Could have just done it after school Instead, they insisted on taking a gap year These are the gap year drones Look at them go Mining from a faraway country God, they're going to have so many good Instagram pictures This game is extremely over. I know some of you are getting upset and I'm looking at these drones Some of you are getting upset because you guys took a gap here and was some of the most meaningful experiences that you've ever had in your entire life And now every year to recreate it, you take a faraway trip to a country for a week and a half Sleep in cheap hostels, but it never feels the same as when you were 18 This is your life now You're one of these drones Wake up, Sheepel I don't know what to say either This game is extremely over These probes are not quite sure what they're doing I like that you had good upgrades. This is the one thing I can complement you on, is that you have fairly good upgrades Shield, armor, plus three And you had maximum upgrades But you got upgrades for units that you don't believe in You get one air upgrade You know the lurker is unbeatable on the ground It's the perfect unit The ultimate 200 kilogram gorilla of a human being with the greatest MMA fighting skills in the world You're trying to fight with him by getting your own upgrades No, you get air units You get a sniper rifle Shoot the guy Should be practicing your archery You're a sword wielding Cheat Why would you fight this guy on even grounds? It makes no sense Get a brain Oh no. Well, your upgrades are not going to finish either You know what I think that GoTo You Death is doing right now? He's kind of like gaining the courage, gathering the courage to type out Gigi You know, I've seen this happen before People need to kind of charge up You can sometimes see it in the eyes of a pro gamer before they're about to leave They don't feel like it deserves a Gigi, but they know that if they don't Gigi, people are going to make fun of them forever It's not even Back in the day, people would say, oh, it's so bad, man. But nowadays, I think people just think it's a little bit sad if you don't have the emotional control to type out Gigi at the end of a game You know, like, is this really what's going to get you? Like, a fictional, a different fictional race that is slightly better than yours This is what's going to get you to not type out the Gigi, really? That's what makes you lose your emotional control People cut in line all day at the supermarket, but there, got your emotions in check But then here, this is where it gets you Unbelievable You get made fun of forever Never if you're a pro gamer leave without duty It's a bad move It's a bad move. Just like staying in this game, but I love that he's still blinking as well I truly believe It's like, man, I couldn't do it earlier when I had 35 more supply Now that I'm down 130, this might be possible Only have half a lack remaining, but going to hit him real hard with it He's still mining as well. does type out the GG here so I managed to gather that courage I appreciate that I appreciate that go to you that but I don't appreciate it's the fact that you didn't believe in your own words you said lurkers are not honorable and I hope everyone that wins like this feels bad if lurkers are not honorable why would you try to fight them on their terms why wouldn't you go into there why didn't you get your carriers why didn't you try the base trade why didn't you run away every move that you made in this game showed the intention that you wanted to fight straight on with the lurkers You always engaged directly into lurker positions You never went around. And you didn't go air You didn't use the two best tools against the lurkers You already knew Everything I'm telling you right now, you already knew You knew the lurker was unbeatable on the ground according to you Yet you didn't play like it You played like you could beat it And then you were surprised when you couldn't How does that make any sense? You already knew you, sir You just needed the validation I'm here to give you that validation, my friend But you already knew that deep down, that you massively sucked Stamp him, hamster Chich All right.

        "text": "Dear Captain, I want to complain about Terran versus Zerk However, I am not complaining about any specific unit that makes it imbalanced I just felt like the whole meta of Bio versus Ling Bain is slightly unfair, especially in lower leagues Terrans in general get punished harder than other races for their mistakes, and it is really frustrating that a leading game could suddenly be reversed in just a few seconds In this replay, I must admit my early to middle game is pretty sloppy, as it is my first Terran v Zerk in many days, and also my first game on this new map I floated some minerals, but so did my opponent I killed a few drones and overlords, but not too much. I won't say I necessarily outplayed my opponent as I had some macro issues, but I also gave myself a pretty nice lead with my multitask and denied his bases to a point that he only had three left Overall, our supplies were pretty close throughout the game, but just one minute after I victoriously denied his own basis, the game theoretically has ended What happened is that I was caught out of position as I moved commended my army into my fifth base location, where unfortunately is also where his army is at. I definitely wasn't expecting to see his whole army at my side of the map and wasn't paying attention for a few seconds, and that is all it takes for a bioterran to face a sudden death I did try to struggle back into the game by turtling behind, like how Maru and Cure sometimes does, but it turned out I am not either of the same them I cannot transition into high-tech army because all my barracks with tech labs are destroyed and I cannot afford new ones In the end, I felt frustrated and unfair that this game got reversed so suddenly I am not saying I deserve to win, but at least I should be given more chance to create a comeback. As soon as bioterroran is forced into a defense position, the Zerk economy expands crazily and there's barely any chance left Mac may still be playable defensively, but I despise Mac players I do admit that it is my fault for not paying attention, but why doesn't the game end when my opponent is not defending his bases properly? Doesn't we all make mistakes? Please tell me, Captain, is Terran v Zerk imbalanced? Or do I suck? This balanced complaint form was sent to me by Gan Sini, a Terran player in the Diamond League, 36002 MMR from the North American Serb And the question is very simple He asked Captain, is Terran versus Zirk imbalanced, or do I suck? Let's investigate All right, here we go. Storm versus Gansini Sounds a little bit like a magician It's like the great Gansini is in town Come and watch his magic show This man can make entire armies of Marines disappear in less than five seconds by walking into balings that are parked at his fifth base, is what he said We're here on Babylon Letter Edition, played on the new patch as well This is the first I-O-this on the new patch Woo-hoo! And yeah, in order to celebrate that, we will be having a new imbalance complaint form as well So be sure to sending your new replays on the new patch, on the new maps, using the new imbalance complaint form in the description down below. Now, with that out of the way, what in the world do we have over here? A drone All right A drone scout This is a very uncommon opener for a simple reason that it delays your hatchery by a lot as a So this was a 17 hatch that started at 58 Take a regular 58 seconds I think a regular 17 hatch might start at like what, 55, 54, maybe even 53 seconds I don't actually know because no one actually plays 17 hatch Usually you see 16 hatch going down instead So it already is a little bit weird I think maybe 51 or 52 seconds is actually the correct timing So it's like 6 to 7 second delay there on that hatchery. So this is already a pretty nice advantage that Ganzini, the green great marine disappearance act man, you know, he has in his pocket right now They can't take away this lead anymore What's that? An Urubu over here, look at it See him picking away at the grass Beautiful stuff One thing that I actually, that I've noticed lately in the imbalance complaint form as a trend, is that people, they are very upfront with their failures in the game, as if that were to absolve them from those failures And this guy went as well I was like, yes, I know my macro wasn't perfect or like maybe my build order wasn't brilliant It's like, well, these are important things, not just because you say them. They don't matter anymore Like if you're in court and you tell the judge, yes, judge, I know I'm not perfect I killed the guy and then, you know, I ate his legs And yes, I know that is what a cannibal does But, you know, it is when I've admitted to being a bad person, surely, you know, you can just tell me to get home It's like, no, you're still going to go to Jill, buddy And it's the same here Just if you're telling me, if you're being honest, you know, that is a nice thing But it doesn't absolve you from your crimes of having terrible build orders or just not macroing for five minutes straight And you shouldn't forget this. This is very, very important to me Because people seem to really, they kind of buy into it, you know It gets them some sympathy It's like, oh, look how honest they are But I don't really care how honest they are I also want, well, I care about that as well Don't want to be lied to But I also want people to Look at this one Look at this one Okay, that's one, okay? Hits himself in one link Now look at the second I hadn't even seen that this first one was also incorrect The second one is the one that really gets me You can see that he's panicking as well as he throws it down Look at a queen Wait, not yet. Come back up the ramp Queen's still there Let me just throw it in the first location possible randomly up there This is fantastic God, I love this stuff Sometimes I wish that there was a bigger audience for just low-level play I would love to just host like a tournament, play it on like the big stage Like an Intel Extreme Master's Katowice Make it a big price pool as well I want there to be a lot of money on the line And then just have it be bronze players slaughtering each other I think it would be the most hilarious thing in the world The only requirement for people to join is that they have never touched the game of StarCraft 2 before. Like I feel like this would turn StarCraft 2 less into a competition and more into a comedy show. But I would be so down for that. Holy crap. This is actually great. I'm actually going to set it up. If any of you have like family that have never played, I want to get show matches between first timers here. And I absolutely need this in my life. I didn't know until I saw this freaking Reaper throw down a grenade twice into absolute nothingness and hitting himself. This is diamond level and this is already very high quality entertainment. God, I love this type of stuff. All right. Let's actually have a look at the build orders here. So triple Cc, this looks honestly like a build order Like this looks good Like there's a tech lab We have a Viking on the way Helions are being produced The Helion harass, you know, it's pretty normal to wait for the first four helions or go out with the first two and keep three and four at home We have almost constant SUV production over here as well An overlord sack to get a scout Like this game feels relatively okay Except for the helion harassed, I guess Let's take a little bit of what my man is doing here with the helions Goes in No, not yet Okay, there we go Harassas fights a queen Tanks the damage with the Hellion is an advanced move. Now, a lot of high-level players will tank with the Reaper, because the Reaper has a regenerative property What I mean with that is that if the Reaper doesn't get attacked for a little while, it will get back its health The Hellions don't have that So what this player does, Gansini, the magician, is he just made the help of this helion disappear, and it will never come back It's the opposite of a magic trick, really It's the guys that take off your watch, that smash it with the hammer, and then they're like, all right, fun trick, now give me my watch back There's no watch anymore You just smashed it with the hammer This is not a magician This is a destructionist. You also have these guys These helions move a lot like a critter, by the way And not so much like how I see Maru usually use them This is This is Look, look, look This is an accident This queen taking damage is an accident Let's take a look here at the first person of the Tarrant The Taryn's not paying attention right now I saw that because he didn't have them selected The Hellions are fighting the queen, which is actually a good move, but that was an accident This was an accidental good move, and thus we don't count it This is like people who win the lottery Buying a lottery ticket is always incorrect. People that win the lottery, you know, they got very lucky It's insane luck It is not fair It's the same with these cars They just killed this queen, but it doesn't count These cars were moving like an absolute critter, like an AI from like Hitman 1 or Hitman 2, which is produced in 2006 or something You know, one of these guys just stand still for a little bit and then starts moving around, walks into a wall for six seconds, and then reset What is these guys doing? I'm very upset with that all of these Hellions stay alive He just moved so deeply on creeped while there were lynx in position It actually pained me. I know he was paying attention to his Liberator, but he lost He killed some workers, though, five workers for a lip Maybe he also killed some with these aliens, I'm not sure It's about an even game Sure, there is an issue that every single barracks was built at exactly the same time, and yes, we're floating 1,200 minerals But let's not forget, Gansini already mentioned that in the imbalance complaint form, and thus we will not be talking about it all Good job, Gansini I'm glad you were honest Your lack of macro, despite being a diamond play is something that will have to, as in Dutch we say, we have to see it through the fingers, also known as turning a blind eye. If you see it through the fingers and also pretend like it didn't happen Classic Dutch proverbs Love to hear it Car is still out on the map There's also some great decision making Look at this This is like one shot away Like all of these helions are so extremely low A queen could sneeze in its direction and then it would just blow up A-choo! Makes absolutely no sense, but managed to do it Only lost, I think lost one helion there just now Ling run by being sent out Despite the Well, actually not much happened in the early game Like one queen died and five drones So yeah, the game is completely even Upgrades are slightly faster here for guns. Going for an 8-Rex? I can't quite recall seeing that in the imbalance complaint for him The fact that he went for an 8-Rex? I don't recall this at all 8-Rex is one of these builds that is extremely all-in Or well, usually is extremely all-in Gansini has been floating like 800 minerals for the past, for the past like 2 5 minutes So an 8-Rex doesn't even really make sense Like he could have gone for an 8-Rex and already have 5 bases up as well because he's just constantly floating money I also believe he forgot his second factory, which is actually the standard if you go for 8-Rex You don't forget it You just don't pick it. But it's just a really weird setup that he's going for I don't quite understand it Where's the tank? What was this? What was this entire fight? Okay, so he spots the run by Now usually this is a good thing If you find someone's run by, you get the pick of these units Gansini magically manages to make his entire Marine Army vanish despite Seeing everything on the screen the entire campaign, this is not split I don't even know, this is You just ran past the bainlings This is the opposite of the Marine Split Challenge, is the Marine Clump Challenge Where you see, like, for people who've never played the Marine Split Challenge. In Marine Split Challenge, you start with a group of, let's say, 16 Marines, and 12 bainlings will come rolling at you on creep And you need to split to minimize the bainling damage, okay? and then if you go to the next level, one more bainling gets added Every level that you gain, another bainling will be added So it gets harder and harder With the Marine Clump Challenge, you start with 50 bainlings, which kill all the marines, and eventually you only have five bainlings left, which need to kill all 16 Marines Now, I've heard that Gansini is actually the perfect, the perfect marine clump player He has managed to lose 35 Marines against only four bainlings, a feat that even Maru couldn't account. when he tried the Marine Clump Challenge So important to keep in mind when judging these fights is that Gansini here is often Like he's Good Lord, these fights are really, really bad It's often trying to clump his units I was mentioning that we need to keep in mind that his control is very poor, but this is really pushing it He just He actually just doesn't micro, but then he does control But then he does control his unit It's a weird combination of factors here at play Do like the movement, though, overall We have a fort base on the way, still no second factory Went for triple tech lab, despite this being an A-Rex. Usually with A-Rex, you just continuously produce Marines, because it's a three-base-all-in, but because he was floating so much money, I guess he kind of just plays like this in general Got extra production to spend his money Don't even mind it too much I would have loved to see a second factory, though, to add a couple of tanks maybe if you're playing against Ling Bain, it's nice to get a second factory with a reactor So one factory can be producing tanks and get drilling claws and the other one can just be producing mines Mines are one of these units that if you play them at a lower level, which diamond is, they're going to be fantastic Let's have a look at that Holy crap. What are you looking at? Okay, so this is what he's looking at right now Okay, this I'm on his screen He sees links and bainlings He, where does he go? He clicks on the fifth base and then he surprised when the links and bainlings kill his entire army A true magician, my friend A true magician He's also, this is a very, you know, magicians are good when they make you feel emotions And he's making me feel emotions that I haven't felt in years Like, levels of rage that I haven't been able to achieve in such a long time Then I'm kind of glad, you know, it makes you believe that you're still alive In the future, I'll just come back to this replay. Keep it saved on like my desktop if I want to get angry They say sometimes that anger is great fuel for your ambitions I lack anger in my life, but, I can just rewatch this replay again and again and I know it's going to keep making me angry more and more Why do we have no factory units out on the map 10 minutes into the game? We've lost three tanks Is it really possible that he only produced three factory units this entire game? I think it is This is also another Oh, there we go Good pickup Actually a good pickup I was happy with that. I was gonna say this is some garbage micro, and it was some garbage micro, but he decided to pick up his units Okay, he denies a base, which I lie I like, but he also loses a lot of units, which I don't like because there was no matter-effect with this push This was a sacrifice So this is probably resources lost-wise It's fairly similar, honestly, what happened here And there's also a fist base, so you don't even really need to completely have it saturated with like 35 drones, although there's quite a few drones mining here It's like 12 drones And we have another push here going towards the bottom side This base could also potentially fall. Please do note that at this point, Storm is extremely far ahead a massive bank He has good tech as well He has the Hydra's, you know, his Hydra Ling Bain, basically Well, Gansini is basically stuck on an army that you can have with just a three wrecks build, marauder, marine, no factory units whatsoever, no tech whatsoever, does have an upgrade lead and is going to continue having an upgrade lead for a little longer Does not, however, have anything to deal with lurkers No Ghost Academy, still no decent tank count, no fifth base, no sensor towers either So I think at this point the game is extremely favorable here for Storm Like just extremely favorable here for Storm. I also like that we're seeing, you know, someone that actually stands for his own values Gansini that is So he said, let's actually just read this again in case some of you have forgotten He said, Mac may still be playable defensively, but I despise Mac players Now other people might I despise Mac players, but in order to play proper bio, you still need tanks and mines and maybe other things But so far, Gansini has introduced a style of play where it's literally just pure bio And he also uses the tanks as if they were bio, never sieges them Oh, and as I say that he sieges one Doesn't really use them in the fights This is a nice little drop by the way. I love that he's pulling back the Marines That has potential for a decent fight I like that I actually like the way this fight, well, don't really like how he's going to end losing a lot, but this was cool And now he pushes this base in as well This is, this is legitimately okay multitasking It's not brilliant I mean, it's not the greatest thing I've seen in my life, but I guess it does the job here There's bailings morphing in this location right now Should be capable of saving the base It's not capable of saving the base Now, okay, this is the scenario where I said I deny two of my opponent's bases My opponent is now on three base. Surely I should be victorious right now Now, let's actually analyze this situation So before I said that Storm was in a fantastic spot and it's difficult for me to imagine seeing him lose this game What is the spot like right now? We have three tanks out So three factory units, 25 Marines, 12 marauders Terran is going to have better upgrades But there's already a hive So the tech is superior here for Storm Storm also doesn't necessarily mind losing these bases because he has a massive bank and didn't lose a lot of the drones. There's going to be a temporary loss of income, but it still is at 2,400 minerals a minute, and it's going to stay at about 1K gas, maybe a little bit lower per minute as well, which is still a very decent amount, if you compare it to what the opponent has Gansini isn't maxed out yet and has worse tech I actually feel like this game is still completely fine for Storm Maybe if you give this to Like, there's no extra command centers, there's no fifth base, we're working off of three orbitals, no sensor tower, on the bottom side And then I guess this is the fight where he didn't pay attention for a little bit and lost everything. I mean, the thing is though here, this is interesting, okay? Right now Gansini is pretending like his usual fight are better than this But so far in this game, almost every single fight has looked pretty much like this, two unseached tanks, the army not in position, not being split, having the most clums at possible Here the army starts getting controlled and actually no supply has been lost yet. He could just pick this up, could just pick this up, run this back to over here and then if you were to have any amount of tanks in any position, the Zirk wouldn't even be capable of attacking, but for whatever reason, he decides to still stim in afterwards, then loses the MED ofX because it doesn't boost? And then he loses the 30 supply So, actually, the point where he wasn't paying attention wasn't even the bad thing The moment he started touching the units again, that's when it truly went sour Like, it has been going with this entire game Now the game is Well, okay, another thing Like, I'm just adding on. Like, this is like freaking compounding here with things that I'm upset about But let's first watch this fight Who's the SUVs to fight the bailings? He holds positions to deal with the baby I've never seen this in my life Holy crap Look at this This makes no sense This is like using your neck to block a knife It's like a guy's coming at you with a knife and you were like this It makes no sense Is it the one part you want to protect? This is insane This is a terrible fight as well, of course. I had a sentence in my mind that I wanted to go for before I saw this fight, but Gansini is just not only making Marines disappear here, but he's also trying his best to get rid of all of his SEVs Only 58 left I could probably, like, he just needs two factories What I was going to say is that Another thing that I find annoying is that he, so he said he despises Mac players, right? And he doesn't want to play Mac Now, this isn't completely fair because at his level, the one thing he complained about, right, is the fact that bio, in the bio versus Lingpain, it's so difficult for bio. And I would say, just play Mac if it's easier, right? This is a good suggestion that you could, that you could give a Terran player is like, hey, if you're struggling against Zirk, play Mac, because that's pretty much the opposite It's really difficult for lower-level Zergs to deal with Mac But if you were to tell this to a Terran player, I've done this in the past, so I know exactly what they would say They say, well, but Mac is not viable at the highest level Serra and Rainer, they don't lose to Mac. It's like, well, mate, if you're hard stuck in diamond because you're losing to Zirk veinlings with your bio, you never in your entire life will have to worry about performing at the high level Like, it is just a different world for you It doesn't matter It's completely irrelevant Okay, just take the good advice and makes absolutely no sense Hey, Mac is a fine composition You can despise these players Probably just jealous because they actually beat Zerks Like, jealousy, that's what it is These are these bioterrorans, you know, that hate the Mac players They're like, oh, it's so slow It's like, yeah, but they're winning games There you go with your 23% win rate against Zirkmate. My man doesn't even have a hotkey for seizing his tanks What is this? Seage it up every single time These tanks are just standing there unseged It's starting to piss me off Here we go Now, the game has now officially ended, but in good Terran fashion he stays in for no real reason Well, actually, that's also not true Terran stay in for no good reason a lot of the time, but Terran also stays in because it's actually the one race that has great combat mechanics, especially against Zirk If Taryn gets to stabilize on four or five bases, on eight gases, and they have like seven, eight tanks, they can go into Ghost From that point on out, the game is pretty much reset. You can almost always turn it into a split map scenario My man saying that it's almost impossible for Taryn to make a comeback is completely incorrect, especially in the Taryn versus Zirk matchup It is extremely common to see Taryn's getting blasted in the midgame, sitting and doing nothing behind planetary, behind very high tank counts, Liberators, Ghost, all the works and then eventually coming back into the game So everything said in the imbalance complaint form, almost everything was incorrect, except when Gansini, you know, said that he was bad at a macro in the early stages of the game That was the part that wasn't a lie That was not a lie That was very nice And I appreciate that as well I appreciate honesty. Now, this fight is going to go Okay-ish terribly? Okay, I saw a couple of things happen here, which confused me. Look at these Marines, just focus on them a little bit, okay? Just shot the Factory, okay? No big problem, you may say. But then look at what this Siege Tank does, okay? Being attacked by Lings, what is this attack doing? What is this attack doing? This Siege Tank Boom! Does it stop? Boom! Imagine me in one of these SCVs. You hear all the explosions? All of a sudden, tank shells start hitting you? How did my man have the attention during all the clumping of Marines and Marauders to also aim of his own Refinery? Fairly impressive. This Factory is also damaged by his own units. Also fairly impressive Actually, an okay hole, by the way Managed to survive despite some minor fears still you're in control there No fifth base yet, which is annoying But maybe if you get your ghost production up, it could potentially be possible to, nah, it's actually really almost impossible The Zerk also is controlling the Baines quite well It's just going to move commanding them in the way you're supposed to I like it There's good upgrades right now as well at this point for the Zerk, right? You have 3-3 at least for range and carapace and there's no Malay upgrades, but it doesn't matter that much most of the damage there is going to come from the beginnings anyway, not so much from the links. Here comes Mr Zirk once more Papp-da-pap-p-da-par-par-pah-pah-pah-pah-pah Actually, okay, fight once again here for terror, no? If he would have split this, maybe? Maybe You're going to be the one that saves me Is this army just kind of AFK over here for the past five minutes? might have And the Eco is so, so good for Zirk, though Yeah This is kind of useless I really think having a faster second factory would have solved so many issues The ability to just produce mines or to produce two tanks at a time would have been fantastic But it's not the case We're just going to kind of speed through it over here Have any of these upgrades been done yet? Okay, yeah. So we do have the range on the planetaries of all the building armor, which is kind of important Could we actually stabilize here? I'm looking at this I'm thinking to myself Nah Nah Nah Not like this, right? No way There's way too many veins And there's just still only a single tank How is this possible? Is he even producing tanks? Yeah, he's producing tanks Okay, now it gets another factory despite never having produced anything from here Also an interesting move This See how well we can clump this time around Oh, all of them are in five pixels Can we do better here, guys? Nah No No Okay, well, put him in a line Mediocre clumping job here. We'll give it a four out of five Four stars out of five Absolutely unheard of He once again attacked one of his own buildings I saw it happen He just turned around Did he shoot a CC or his matter of fact? I don't even know No Gigi as well Absolutely love to see that Yeah All right First of all, I think the one thing we have to note is that the macro was fairly mediocre The splits were god-awful But most importantly, the sense of what was happening in the game was completely off After he sniped the two outside bases, he thought he won the game But he was so far behind at that point already. And he didn't actually kill any drones, just the bases So you deny some mining, but just temporarily, like it might have cost your opponent, what, like six, 700 minerals per base It was like 1,400 minerals He lost a bunch of units up top as well Like, the trades were good for him, but it wasn't some insane trait where you say snipe four bases clean, you're on nine bases behind it, you're pumping out ghost and matter of facts No, you were on crabtag You were on crabtag the entire game Never had any support from your tanks or from mines Never went into ghost in your entire life. If your opponent had built any amount of lurkers, which the lurker then was ready, you would have never beaten that because you had nothing that could shell lurkers away And I think the main problem here is just honestly your micro You say you despise Mac players, but I see no future for you for you in anything higher than the Diamond League unless you switch out of bio because you do need a certain level of control Your opponent has shown that you simply do not possess So no, my friends, it is not Zerk that is imbalanced in the Taryn versus Zerk matchup, but it is instead you who sucks And that's life Sometimes you just suck And you definitely did in this game. All right, that's going to be it for me today Thanks all so much for watching I hope you to enjoy this episode of is it in bar duers hug like i mentioned before new imbalance complaint form be sure to fill it in all the way it's right now in the youtube description box so be sure to go in there and that's it i'll see all of you next time for more videos thanks so much for watching and bye bye."

        "text": "Turtle Terran is Inba This guy opened up with his CC first, so I tried to harass him with my adept, only to realize he was going Planetary Fortress on second base Seeing that, I played greedily, taking my third and fourth base quite early I kept expanding, I even started sending out some zealot run bys, but he has too much splash damage I got some tempest to break his defense, but the widow mines with Fassborough were too fast to react to And it didn't work I kept expanding and expanding even trying to deny him from expanding But Terran is Inba He has so much mules to keep his economy going and whenever I tried to break his defense directly, I fail. Tanks shoot down my stalkers, widow mines kill my zealots, and the planetary at his second base prevents me from even doing good damage to him In the late game, he somehow got so many Vikings to drop on my base and destroy a lot of stuff I was focused on spamming zealots to run by, so I was caught of guard I've just had enough My workers are mostly dead My sanity is almost dead And he got so deep in my head that I unleashed my inner Terran and didn't say, Gigi. How could Terran Turtle like this and somehow still be a hat? So Captain, is it Imba? Or do I suck? That question gets asked by Homura, who plays on the Korean server, is in the Platinum League at 3200 MMR and plays Protos with a very simple question Is it Inba or does he suck? And we're here to figure that out All right, my friends, here we go in the game between Homura, our Protos player, our platinum hero And in the top right, we have whatever this means, Korean characters here out of our Red Terran player and a Mac game Or at least, that's what it seemed like here from the imbalance complaint form I get loads of these. I get loads of imbalance complaint forms about Mac tanks, mines, planetary fortresses, force, Vikings I hadn't heard before I don't, I think this is the first time that I think in like, well, like a 160, 170 episode that we have someone complain about the Viking But I guess it's also part of the Mac army in a way The thing with Mac often is, is that it has to do with money, okay? As a Protos player, you don't need to take one good fight against Mac You can take six fights that are decent And just because you have more money, because the Mac player can't kill you, because they can't move out across the map majority of the time, they need their defensive setup. You're going to be fine as ProDals You have quick tech switches as well, all of that good jazz Now, this is interesting because Homura did mention that there was a CC first, and that's indeed what's going down So that's a reasonable read here at the start But what is our Okay, I'm not quite sure what this Terran is doing because there's no barrack yet So we see a CC or we'll see a worker down here, which yeah, indeed is going to throw down a CC Now, I'm going to do something that might be a little bit mean or that might sound a little bit mean, but Homura is an idiot for not realizing that something is off And don't get me wrong. I'm not saying that Homura should know the exact timing of the barracks Oh, if it's CC first, the barracks should come down at, you know, 130 or 120 or whatever time I don't know what timing the barracks should start either But, but ladies and gentlemen, this CC is 69, nice, seconds into building You know that it doesn't take more than a minute to mine 150 minerals on one base Where in the world is the barracks? That is the question that Homura should be asking Where is the barracks? He's either being proxied or there is a problem proxy base or that's it These are the only two options right now. And yes, it is possible that he doesn't know how much someone mines a minute It's okay to not know that you mine like between 850 and maybe a thousand minerals a minute if you're properly saturated in a main base That's okay But you should still know that something is wrong right now This is done There's no barracks yet That's completely off You know there are people Everyone knows these people They have them in there, you know, around you It's like maybe it's your mom or your dad or your little brother or if you have friends It's one of your friends These are people that are, they have no clue about the passing of time You know, they're not very good with it. So they'll tell you, I'll see you in 10 minutes and they'll be gone for 20 minutes, you know, double the time It's like, oh, I lost track of time It's like, oh, twice as March It's not that bad Now, this isn't like that Okay, this is freaking 150 minerals that are missing This is more like if your dad says he's going to the corner store to get some cigarettes and he doesn't show up for another five years and all you get is like a Christmas card from him That is more like this This is a significant portion of the resources that you know your opponent has are missing and Homura isn't responding to that. And I think that is very painful in this situation And we're at a league in Platinum on the Korean server where I think it is very fair to expect people to understand this concept, to understand the concept of money in, money out I think this is one of the most basic concepts in StarCraft 2, and Homura is seemingly not understanding it, and that disappoints me a little bit I do like his build, well, I like his build order, I don't like the amount of money he's floating, he's floating like 6, 700, getting a Robo Bay, double gases. This is not a good build order at the high, But this is a perfectly fine build order to get you to Masters League or to even get you to low grand masters Like it's a simple build It gives you a lot of vision because you can easily get observers out You're relatively safe on your two bases initially It's easy to deal with drops because you can build a lot of units out of your three gateways It feels good to play this build order, is what I'm trying to say It feels darn good to play this build order. If you want to learn a standard builder in Brut versus Starrant, this is completely fine to But execution isn't brilliant and the scouting also hasn't been brilliant so far because right now we're completely unaware of what is going on here on the other side of the map We're four minutes and 45 seconds in and right now there's two marines out for the Terran player Now I could make fun of the Terran's terrible build order because this build order is really quite bad But we could also make fun of Humura of not being capable of capitalizing on this. Just for a point of reference here, if Homura were to play a proper three-gate blink build, like the one that I would play, he would be hitting five seconds ago with 12 blink stalkers, a prism and an observer And there would be three marines to defend that And before anyone even thinks about starting to argue that these stalkers might not be able to break the planetary when it gets repaired, we ran a quick simulation on what would happen You just come up, blink up the ramp, the ramp, sit on top of the production, deny any factory units and have a damn good time against three marines that might still try to tickle you But the planetary is no help at all here. That would be a very difficult defense, like an extremely difficult defense Some might even want to use the word impossible Now I've seen mission impossible and sometimes what seems impossible at the start of the movie isn't so impossible at the end for all four episodes of Mission Impossible or however how many Mission Impossible is there actually? I think there's at least three now It's like one of these series where I feel like every few years there's a new one and I don't really pay It's a bit like Fast and the Furious Like Fast and Furious 12 has recently been released as well I don't know anyone either who watches Fast and the Furious or Mission Impossible It's just one of these franchises. that keeps going I feel like it's the same with Guardians of the Galaxy, where we're like Guardians of the Galaxy 12 coming out soon Like the first one wasn't even that good I'm not sure why we're making like the seventh sequel It just doesn't make a whole lot of sense It's like a lack of creativity, says the man who's made 170 episodes of, is it inba or do I suck? But that's a story for another time It's fine to criticize other people as long as you love yourself Harsh them, 23 Nice Let's not forget that Homera so far hasn't scouted the proxy base yet I looked at the planetary, the barracks in the wall. I was like, you know what? Probably no third base anywhere else A bunch of turrets as well This is an insane setup, by the way Actually, you got two worker kills And goes back home I love the casualness at which this happened He flew in, dropped it, killed to workers, and pissed back off home These are like the guys that go fishing They throw out their fishing rod They catch one fish And they're like, all right, that was it for today They go back home, have a beer And that's life You know, happy with what they have They don't need more You know, there's the people that always need more and more and more in their life. You know, they get a nice car Their neighbor gets a bigger car They also want a bigger car This Disruptor is completely content with life He got two kills He's going to chill on the prism He's retired now We're never going to see him again I hope he goes to the top left of the map, unbinds this hotkey, and tapes off the bottom left side of the mini map So that way is never going to get used again I think this is a good call Another thing that would be quite a decent call here is if we'd get some scouting of the side bases Right now we're really hitting the territory where no third base at the 8 minute mark is dangerous. The moment you're taking a fourth base against someone that's on two bases, you might want to check if there's a proxy base I love that this orbital starts eight minutes in This DC has been done for like five minutes It could have had thrown down five mules already, which is like a thousand minerals But instead he just built it now This is the beauty of lower level optimization It's just because it isn't there Oh, we actually have some scouting There's actually okay except in front of the opponent's base Look at this I just want to take a look at this vision Look at this So you have vision of your own fifth base, vision on your opponent's third and your opponent's fourth. You know there is nothing on your opponent's third and fourth And rather than scouting when the moveout is going to come or with what the move out is going to come Because I'm assuming right now that Homura thinks that this is a two base all in Because that is the only thing that makes sense Nothing, legitimately nothing has happened in this game two SEPs have gone down and I guess maybe four SEPs have gone down I don't even know what else have gone down Yeah, four SUVs have gone down That's it Nothing else has happened Humura must think this is a two base all in because literally nothing is happening But he's not scouting. Look, the one area that's important is down the ramp or in front of his opponent's natural. There's no observer, nothing. Now, there's two observers, but both of them are camping this general area above the Cybernetics Core. Okay, this base at least got spotted. But at this point I already kind of think it's too late. This was world's greediest build order. Like this was legitimately double-CC into Barracks, and it didn't get punished. So, what did he ask again in the form? Let me have a quick look. How could Terran Turtle like this and somehow still be ahead? Well, how could Terran Turtle like this and somehow still be ahead? It's very simple. They got away with sneaking out a base, build a creptone of SUVs there Well, you were getting four gases before you got your third base You took your third base relatively late You took your fourth base, honestly, relatively late as well I know probably for Platinum League this is quite fast, but your opponent just probably mined more than you and thus has a bigger army Like I don't quite know what to tell you here This is I'm so confused by your complaint here that I can't even form a sentence anymore Okay Imagine you have two guys that work at a supermarket They're the same age and make the exact same wage Okay, we'll call them John and Paul. John worked 10 hours last week Paul worked 150 hours last week Then John gets upset because Paul gets paid more, despite knowing that he worked 15 times as long Your opponent had more mining and does more money Both of you are floating approximately the same amount of money Like, I don't know what you want here Did your opponent gain supply during this fight? What was this? You know, you've heard these stories of the of like lemmings that run off a cliff You know, it's like a suicide pact between these animals Um, I felt like these stalkers did something similar here Like they were done with living Like what in the world is this fight? Holy God Your opponent had what? Like 1. 190 supply? Your opponent lost like 10, 12 supply and you lost 70 Now your mining is actually quite, okayish, but it's not brilliant I mean, you're still practically getting out mind Also, the story about the Lemmings, by the way, I think is fake I believe it was a myth or something, and then some film crew went to go film the Lemmings mass committing suicide, running off a cliff, but then it didn't happen, so I think they forced them off a cliff, and then they recorded that They killed like thousands and thousands of, I think they're called Lemmings It's absolutely messed up It seems like in the 60s or something Pretty sure it was in black and white as well. So the boomers who did it Or the generation before the boomers maybe I bet it was the boomers though Don't like that Eh, it's proper mean It's like it was mean to these stalkers as well I didn't even see a film crew behind it Um, aren't you filming it, like, right the second? But maybe, yeah, maybe I just missed that Maybe there was a film crew, but I didn't see it Pushing the stalkers into the mines Yeah, we'll have to watch that in the in a slow review, the replay The highlight reel of that fight That was a terrible fight Yeah, the resource loss doesn't look so great I can lose pretty garbage. Okay, and here come the salad run by, since an interesting one as well Knowing your opponent is like, oh, is it a 30 It's a ridiculous army as well 32 mines I love the complete lack of observers with you Okay, now we're going There we go Yeah, yeah Oh, hey Does you have drilling claws already? Yeah, yeah None of these mines are dying, are they? He's lost three mines Just killing crap This is so sick I've seen this type of game before as well where people just keep running into the same No way Just keep running into the same mines again and again This zealot was gonna kill these three tanks That would have been legendary. I love how he sends them in on on the recharge of the mines as well You know, rather than sending so many that you can overpower the mines, he sends them in waves of 10 So that the mines are always ready for this Okay, here we go Nice Okay, good control Almost correct Come on, move back No need to stay in mine range Yes! Why? What is this move? They're literally, you see this, you're looking at it No? This is his vision, I think This is like building a house in a hurricane Oh no, not a hurricane Quick, let me start a new house Halfway done, boom Hurricane hits Fantastic play Call him the King of Home Development This is actually insane. I've never seen somebody make this many bad calls when it comes to fighting The impressive part is that I feel like he's expanding quite fast but doesn't have a lot of workers It's like he's just building bases like it's going to give him like passive income He's a legit the type of guy That watches like a TikTok or a YouTube short about real estate investment And he learns about passive income What he does, he builds like three houses in his backyard and just sits there, waits for them to start making money Not realizing he's going to need tenants at some point Mr Money over here Six workers Nine over here Loving life. 12 out of 16 looking good buddy you complete idiot I don't think you can tease building zealous as well this is so good up eight more gateways and he's like man what has been performing well so far this game for me it's just like scratching his head doing like the calculations on one of these old school calculators now with just one line of numbers pressing it's like a zealous look good to me like let me send in 12 months more Die again This is so sick It's actually mental The fact that these resources lost are so close honestly makes me want to reverse stamp it, you know? Protos is the broken one How is this guy the same level? This is actual. He even has disruptors People ask me It's like, hi, Kev, I'm platinum, and I don't understand how to beat mines I'm like, hey, disruptors are a great tool, you know, because you can just click on the ground and the mines stack Like, oh, thanks, Kevin And then they send me an email two later to bag It's like, ah, I'm still losing to mines I'm like, ah, I'm sorry, keep practicing And now I'm seeing one of these games, like, happening right in front of me This guy built disruptors, which isn't using them Allow the mines to recharge once more It's like, all right, time to go Has an observer, has disruptors Okay, here we go Setting it up, setting it up There, yeah. Okay, see? There's not a lot of speed here, but this is obviously the correct thing to do Literally everything in this army outranges the mines There's legitimately not a single unit in this army that has to walk into the mines to do anything It's insane No? This is the perfect army Oh no, the flank If he's going to snipe this observer, I'm going to be so upset Come on, please, please, please, please No, no, just run, buddy, or shoot the disruptors That's actually a huge shot Oh How is this possible? Does he just not see it running towards him? Maybe he's playing blindfolded Like recording a YouTube challenge as well Holy crap dude This really is something else. Now we get the Viking transition Because the mines are losing their value Well, they're not losing their value, but I guess our Terran players have had enough of the mines Still on 70 workers, by the way No extra houses have been built in the backyard It's like, ah, it doesn't work at all I'm not getting any passive income What's going on over here? These gases don't provide any extra money How weird! It just has four gases that aren't mining 18 gateways, two Robos, two Stargates This is the game of a lifetime This is I'm getting freaking I'm getting chills, but I'm not sure because it's So good or so bad Well, it's definitely not so good, but it is something. I'm not quite sure what I'm watching And some people have that when they listen to a really good song for the first time, you know? Like they just get like, they get like the shivers It's like, oh Or like a touching moment in a movie, you know, they tear forms in their eye Good Lord It's like he clumps them up as well to get hit by as much possible Okay, here comes the Vikings Holy crap 31 Vikings out The Protos is practically dead at this point Has lost, I'm not even quite sure how, but about 9K, well I know how in widow mines 9K more Here come the Vikings Do we have the smart servers? No, there's no smart servals yet. There's no smart servals yet So there's an upgrade that allows the Vikings to land and go flying quicker That's called smart servals But he hasn't researched it This Darren player That is the one surely if you're building 32 Vikings That is an upgrade that you do want to get I love that he went for ship weapons, one vehicle weapons and ship weapons This was the end game, always I can't believe that I'm watching a game be won with landed vi- I don't think I've been playing this game for legitimately 13 years, right? Game came out in beta in like 20-23, almost for 13 years, 12-and-a-half, 12-12-and-three quarters, something like that. I don't think in my entire life, I saw a game ending with landed Vikings as the main composition Sometimes, you know, the Vikings, they win a battle against the Colossite and they land and deal some damage But as the main comp, I legitimately don't think I've ever seen this You know how people sometimes say, in order to, you know, something that's very unlikely, I'll say, in a unit, there is a universe in which, and then something unlikely So there is a universe in which I married Tom Cruise, or there is a universe in which Belgium is a country that people want to live in voluntarily That type of stuff. I always thought of that with there is a universe in which mass-landed Viking is a composition that wins games I always thought it would not be my actual universe But here we are Ten Vikings being produced at a time This is legit five Starports with reactors This is a thing of beauty This is how StarCraft is supposed to be played This has to be so demoralizing to lose to I can't imagine this If someone was killing me with pure Viking, I'm not quite sure if I would continue playing This has to be hard on the mental state, no? I'm almost starting to pity Homer He's just walking around with his stalk I don't know what to do I have so many bases. My passive income isn't showing up My gas, my gas count is low Life is awful for him This is garbage He sends in the replay for some friendly advice It's completely blasted by this cocky content creator He's just Oh, he's taking Having a terrible, terrible week, this guy I feel like I'm kicking him while he's down Still no smart surfals, by the way I've never seen this in my life Like, legit, there's never seen this in my life Someone play like this This is insane Hey, is he going to land again? Yeah, she's going to land again 3-3 upgrade? How is it? Wait, wait He has two 1? Mr Money, the king of the expanding He's on 2-1 upgrades. Alright, all right, all right, as I would like to say This makes absolutely no sense This is so insane to me I love the harass though 10 Hellions at a time, 10 Vikings at a time He's bawling This game is fairly over though Terran did all of this on five base Well, five and a half He practically mind out half of this base before it got discovered by the Protos forces I understand why you'd be upset after playing this game Because you look at this and none of the things that happened in this game ever happen on the high level And it felt strong I'm sure of it I'm sure that Homura thought of this game, looked at his Gamefelt to himself. These mines, they're easier to micro for the Terran because they're just in the ground Right? There's a I think there's a fair thing to say The Terran has to do very little with those And then the tanks, they just sit there, don't do anything The planetary is just there as well But this isn't quite how StarCraft works Because Just because something is good at a lower level doesn't mean it's actually in balance This is a little bit Imagine you're a very bad streetfighter And so is your opponent Also a very bad street fighter And your opponent, I think his streetfighter is allowed to do whatever And your opponent sits like this and he has knives coming out of his arms. And he just sits like this protecting his hat That's all he does He doesn't move He doesn't fight back He doesn't strike You just sits there with his knives around his hat And your strategy is to hit with your wrists on his knives and headbutt the knives with your head as well And in complaining that your opponent doesn't have to do anything because the knives are so powerful by themselves and you can't do anything No, no, it's not to do with the knives being too strong You're an idiot You could have just gotten knives yourself and sat like this or you could have just not hit him in the arms on the knives and maybe, you know, kick him in the coronas or. You know, do something, I don't know how street fights I've never been in a street I've never been in a fight in general I hope I never get into a fight I would have no clue what to do I'd be completely clueless I'd have to send it into a street fight content creator Was this street fighter imbalance or do I suck? And the guy would say, well, obviously you're a terrible street fighter He just kept hitting the knives again and again and again And honestly, if I were the guy sending in the video street fighting, then I would accept that Just like Homura, I think you have to accept it as well All of your fights, all of them, were garbage. You kept walking into mines like an idiot You had somewhat correct counters, honestly You just didn't use them You also kept expanding without putting probes on the basis If you're playing against Mac, you can easily go up to 85, 90 workers, no problem, get cannons on the outside basis to protect them against Hellion run bys, and you should be fine If you really struggle with this type of comp, you can even go into mass carrier plus disruptors, easiest composition to control and I mean disruptors kill the mines, carriers kill everything else. Like, there's so many solutions to your problem and it felt like you were close to the solutions but then whenever you had a fight you just bungled it in a in like a in a big way as well It wasn't just like oh, that was an okay fight but I barely lost it It's like you got into a fight down 20 supply and you walked out of a fight down 90 supplies like, wow, that's impressive You know, it's like, I don't even quite know how to do it I've never seen someone lose to landed Vikings either I'm just not sure what to do with you Like, I feel bad that this happened, but at the same time, you definitely sucked. And that's just the way the world You, you sucked I'm kind of sorry I feel, I pity you I think that's even worse Landed Vikings, I wouldn't wish this up on my worst enemy Well, that's going to be it for today's episode I hope you learned something and I hope you enjoyed it And if you did, please send in your own replay in the new updated description and the updated form as well As we require some replays on the new patch, on the new maps And hopefully I'll see all of you there next week for a new Iodas and tomorrow, of course, for a new video Thanks so much for watching and bye-bye."

        "text": "Dear Master Hars them, I really need to complain about lurkers I played my kind of freestyle in this game, which worked quite good for the start, going for a pretty successful midgame aggression, forcing the Zerk into a lot of units, trading well My macro wasn't spot on in this time span, but I dealt the damage to equalize the lack of macro Then he got his Lurker them ready Seeing the Lurkers, I decided not tech into something that counters Lurkers My strategy to counter them was just not fighting them, resolving in going ham into his base and using the distraction to cripple his economy. They say Starcraft is just a numbers game, so I kept building the units that led me into this beautiful position, hoping I could just overrun my opponent But I made this calculation without the massive nuke-like area damage of the lurker He goes all in knowing he has to deal damage and, well, see yourself what happens Seems like I wished my opponent too much luck in the beginning Bram-bram! Your name is Kegan D on the European server in the Diamond League with 3,900 and 80 MMR And the question here is, is the lurker imbalanced? Or does Kegan suck? And we're going to find out All right, my friends, there we go. Kegan D versus Johnny on Babylon, of course, one of the new maps, beautiful map A small main base, kind of easy third, defendable four technically, maybe a defendable fifth, but it often provides quite interesting games I don't really mind this map all that much I actually kind of like, oh, look at that Oh, that is indeed a lot of luck that Kegan wished here in the early game What's an interesting clan name, by the way? D N I wonder what that stands for If you know what D N stands for, be sure to let me know in the comments I'm curious and get creative with it as well I want to hear your wild takes What was it? Extractor trick. Wait, what? Extractor trick 15 hatch Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Okay, this is one of these build orders that people do That isn't actually good But they do it because they think it has some, like special value What in the world am I watching here? Is this a link flood? Another extractor trick 15 hatch 14 pool Okay Economically this is not very good I know we're not supposed to criticize people that don't send in the replay, but this is a wild builder This is one of these builds people do They figured it out by themselves and they think it's so brilliant You know, they don't do any of the benchmarking, but they just feel like it's better. than what they see at the high level I get emails about this stuff legitimately all the time I'll get an email of like a guy who's in gold or platinum or diamond And it sends me a replay against the AI It's like, hey, I found out a new build And I haven't seen it in ProPlay yet But if you play it, I would like credit because I think this is really going to revolutionize the matchup And then this guy takes three Nexus before the first Gateway and starts pumping out Void Rays And then I'll send a message back. like ah what what if your opponent 12 pools and he'll i'll get i'll get another email back and it will be something along the lines of ah i haven't figured out the counter to 12 pool exactly or even against a regular pool timing or a link flood but if you get away with it you're in a pretty darn good spot i'm like all right thanks uh i'm not sure if i'm going to be using this in the near future but i'll keep it in the back of my mind yeah is a lot of emails like this some of them are are worse than the three nexus before gateway idea as well So it's a wild world out there. And I think Johnny has been caught as well by that He somehow got it in his mind that 14 hatches a legitimately good build And yeah, it's not It's absolutely not a good builder Please don't play this Was there a Reaper here? Did I miss a Reaper? Okay, this was Marine first Oh, into very fast aliens Cool Nice little build order could micro the Marine here to probably keep it alive not the greatest control, actually, really not the greatest control, but? An actual build order Would love to see a tech lab down here, but obviously he's busy trying to micro away So I don't even mind it completely I believe this is going to be Benchie, just based on the two gas. It's the only Viking Viking, Marine, Viking I don't know Matter of fact Mines Okay, not a huge fan of this You do see it every now and again as Johnny goes for Okay, Johnny went gasless Oh, this is a game already, isn't it? It's really difficult sometimes to give advice if both players are just kind of playing wonky builds and to kind of analyze the positions because this is one of these things I just have no real experience with Kegan opening without a Reaper into mine drop, tech lab on the barracks, a double mine drop after building two heads Helions, then a third C C And he's playing against someone that opened with Gasless, into double gas, roaches. Which is also not really a build order So we're watching two things clash that don't really exist This is a It's like the fantasy battles you have when you're a kid You know, it's like We have Digimon fighting Pokemon It's like both of them are fictional It's not real You can't fight with them We had a kid in our neighborhood, who was really keen on all the lore He's like basically the lore master of our neighborhood He knew everything about Pokemon and Tijimon But even he, he wouldn't go into Tegimon versus Pokemon because they didn't live in the same universe He was very keen on that So we'd play games like, you know, you'd pretend to be a Pokemon or something like that. Actually, so we'd often pretend to be Pokemon It's like I had an insane childhood But I think this is normal for kids So, and whenever you're a Pokemon, everyone always wanted to be a Pokemon because there was way more fun than being the trainer But there also had to be a trainer, you know, like there had to be someone that was playing Ash as well in our fantasy world There is some good damage by the way But no one wanted to be the trainer So the lore master always ended up being the trainer because he was the only person that was truly attached to the idea that Pokemon would be completely wild in the head if there wasn't a trainer. Everyone else like, well, we could just be Pokemon by themselves don't need a trainer I just realized they had nothing to do with Starcraft This is a good mind drop, though, and it killed a lot of workers But yeah, so if you have a lore master in your neighborhood, he's going to be the trainer, and you can pretend to be squirtle Don't let your dreams be dreams, my friends The future is yours Just like the future is right now on the hands of Keegan D, who's playing a build order that has not been showcased before, this looks like a hellbat all-in, but then without the all-in part, and so far also without the hellbats. Now, if you remove both the hellbets and the all-in from the hell-bat all-in, you're left with nothing That's kind of how I feel about this early game as well Yes, he dealt damage, but the rest of his was Really nothing happened here This is also not an army This is five marauders, and three, four mines, six cars It's one of these armies you look at and you think to yourself, this has been theory crafted This is a guy at home whose internet connection is down because he's part of some crappy ISP It's the only one in his neighborhood as well And in his little notebook, he wrote, Marauders kill Roach, Helions kill Ling, mines kill Bainling, Medevax, Yuma units. and then in his mind, he's like, ta-da, fixed Terran versus Zerk, completely destroyed it, and then starts playing this type of graph because, holy cow, this is not a build order You're supposed to have an opener like this and then hit around 30 seconds, well, actually, didn't even build any air units except for a matter of fact, so he's probably supposed to hit like a minute ago with 16 Marines with Stim and 1-1 on the way, but instead we have no upgrades yet But we do have an armory Hellbats, transitioning mid-fight, but only two of them And another three do it while being biled This was the worst way this fight could have gone. And despite all of that, the terrible composition, the terrible control, Kegan is still completely fine And I think it's because his macro hasn't been so bad for Diamond It's just everything else that has been bad The tier rising And look at this, look at his helmet go He's also floating 900 I don't actually know what he's doing correct Sometimes I look at these games And I wonder what people's strengths are Do you ever have that? Sometimes you also have it with actual people in real life, where you look at them and you think to yourself, I know you must have some types of strength, but I can't find it right now. There's a guy that lives very close to me that walks his dog, and he doesn't pick him up the poop of his dog I've seen it multiple times now already and it annoys me because my dog is a moron and eats the poop of other dogs And then I have to pay attention to make sure there's no poop on the floor, which makes my relaxing walk a little bit more like a Sherlock's home series I have to look on the floor for clues if this man with his glasses has dropped the deuce on the floor It's very frustrating I look at that guy and I think to myself, I see no redeeming qualities. There's no strong characteristics, you know, there's nothing good about you I feel the same about Kegan D's play so far The composition makes very little sense The micro is not great Has no upgrades We're building a Ford base and another factory So there is something in the head of his that makes it, you know, makes him wake up in the morning and build stuff but I'm not entirely seeing yet what it is Like, why are we even right now? I don't understand It feels like every decision in this game so far has been incorrect But I guess the macro is quite good, and maybe that's just enough at this level He's macroing well, and he's fighting, I guess He's A-moving at times. He sometimes has halberts ready before a fight Like, I'm not more upset with Kegan than I am with John I think so far the game is I it's just a diamond game But maybe slightly worse than I thought diamonds would be The funny thing is that if I were to do this in rank roulette, I feel like I would get it correct But if I wouldn't know that this was diamond right now, there's absolutely no way I would have guessed this at diamond Because this has just been a disappointing all around Lurker Dan on the way, a Thor? The Thor is not a counter to roaches and hydras The Thor is a counter that specifically targets Muralisks or Brutelords. These are the two scenarios in which I am willing to see a Thor These are the only two scenarios in this entire matchup Never against Roach Hydra Ravager or against Roach Hydra Ravager or against Roe or against lurkers, are Thor's any good? They're always worse than a tank They have less than a tank You don't have any tanks either, do you? There's no thanks here No Thor's It is a banned unit It's not okay, okay? Well, not okay Six marauders popping out 1-1 11 minutes into the game Standard 1-1-1 timing we look on the other side, it's also just plus one. Like, how can I get mad at Kegan D for playing garbage if he's also playing versus garbage? He's just copying what he sees This is childlike behavior perhaps No, you copy what you see But I can't blame him for it if this is, like this is working on this level apparently I think he's ahead In his four bases, he's down to any workers, sure, but And yes, the composition is completely He's building Hellbats against Roach Hydra High I just don't quite understand where, in your mind, the Hellbat Thor combination from the factory is the ultimate unit that you want here. Like, the factory units kind of are like the superheroes of your army, you know? these are the guys that back up the working class guy, the Marine and the Marauder, you have the tank, you know, there's a Superman in the back Now, the Thor in this case is a little bit like Catwoman, I guess You know, you get Batman and then Catwoman No one really knows if Catwoman is even a superhero I've never seen her I've never seen a Catwoman movie either And that's what the Thor is as well in this situation It's like, you know, you're in trouble, your city is being attacked by some evil villain and Catwoman shows up. You're like, well, couldn't you have sendover Batman or Superman or one of the guys that goes invisible and you just, you know, can run very fast, you know, just anything else I don't think someone with kitty ears, I don't even know what the powers are Maybe we can jump higher, or is nine lives? If you have nine lives, it would be tough as well If he'd be a sucky superhero, he'd die like six times already You have to come back three more times to die in the same way again This game is actually over, by the way Like, legitimately nothing good here is going on for Johnny Johnny is Uber dead He has 66 drones He has no upgrades. He's losing to someone building Hellbad Marine Marauder Thor This has to be the worst day in Johnny's life Johnny came home from work after a long day of filling numbers in in a spreadsheet in Excel or Google spreadsheets Marketing genius, Johnny But undervalued at his company, came home, wanted to play a couple of games Yeah, he's not the greatest, but he loves building roaches and hydras They're getting beaten by some guy without Metafax? This guy has no Metafax Three Metafax, they're all in the main No Metafax? Just messing Hellbets because he thinks the helmet looks cool Kegan D doesn't actually think about unit counters He just builds the units that look the sickest So the Thor is big The helmet has fire. Let's build those And right now Keegan D is in a position where it's legitimately, impossible, but actually impossible to lose the game Let me pick open this balance complaint What did he say? They say StarCraft is just a numbers game, so I kept building the units that led me into this beautiful position, hoping I could just overrun my opponent This is absolutely, this is the type of thinking that would get you very, very rich on the stock market as well So imagine you have a stock that performed very well for you and then the company basically goes bankrupt The one thing you probably shouldn't do is buy more of that stock You probably should, you know, diversify your assets. And that's what you should be doing here as well Okay, I think that even if you would have diversify your assets here, If you would have ghost, for examples or tanks, if you would have moved commended into six lurkers like this, I don't think it actually matters This is the stock equivalent of forgetting the password to your account and not having a backup email attached to it And having it attached to a fake name as well because you thought it would be funny This was legitimately the worst fight in the entire world There was 90 supply that just went down There was actually 90 supply that just ran in there and died 90 That's a 9 and a 0. You're still honestly, maybe in a playable position? No, you're not You could have just legitimately counterattacked, just left these lurkers for what it is, build two liberators, one tank, and keep your own How is the response to get more hellbats? At this point, I don't understand I actually don't understand that at all Because you said what led you to this beautiful position is what you're going to continue building Now you're in a crap position, and you're still building those units Unless your plan is to completely run by every run by everything basically I don't really see how you're planning on engaging with the lurker Your position is significantly worse than before and you're getting the same army. If you couldn't win with 190 supply against 84, how are you going to win down 15 supply? That doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me It just doesn't I love to scan here It's like, just analyze the situation And look at this I have one, two, five lurkers, six lurkers, lots of hydras Don't think I can fight that Don't think it's possible And then just stands over here still doing nothing rather than base trading This is like watching a volcano erupt, looking at the lava and thinking, if that lava hits me, I'm probably pretty dead And then not running away It's like, well, yes, you are probably. pretty dead if the lava hits you and maybe you know he should get moving but my man kegan d has different plans he sets up a flank here well some sort of a flank actually it's not a bad engagement takes out two hydrants touche scans again sees the army he's like okay that looks really bad for me let me just move through it for a couple of seconds see how much damage these spikes can do doesn't scan now? It's like, hmm, maybe I can go if I don't scan Because he might have moved Maybe Or maybe not Planetary here is actually proving to be pretty useful Another marauder out Still no tanks on the way No liberators Just more hellbats. Eight more lurkers coming out And Johnny definitely has got the taste for the lurker right now Yeah, there's absolutely no way Is it Half of the lurkers aren't even burrowed Yeah, this is a game over Scans again It's like, huh, still way too many units I'm not sure why we keep scanning to confirm the fact that we're still very dead It's like taking a couple of pictures of the lava It's going over me now Watch this Instagram Live! Like, well, not quite sure if that's how you want to be known till the end of time GG? GG Like the insane thing in this game is that I really do feel like that Keegan is ahead the entire time entire time. And yes, he's not playing perfect and he has a weird composition And he's a bit of an idiot I'll admit to that immediately But did Johnny play so well? What did he do? He built roaches He built hydras Then he builds lurkers He's down 90 supply He has no mining whatsoever The only mistake Kegan made here was one thing And that's that he didn't build ghosts Sure, didn't build tanks But the lurker is too easy to use at this level You know what? actually, I think it's going to happen Guys, what I actually wanted to say is, you suck, Egan See you next week Thank you."

        "text": "Dear Harsdom, I'm about to show you the best Protos vs Theran early game I've ever played I got matched up against the Grand Master Terran, 500 plus MMR above me, and I played spectacularly against him in the early game I killed 10 workers with three units Three units! You have to admit the control was decent enough to find what should be game-ending damage Unfortunately for me and my Proos brethren, we have to deal with the likes of these mouth-breeding Terran players and their Stim bio I'll admit, I dropped an extra two gates to put maximum pressure on the Terran and the attack failed, so my tech transition would be hampered a bit. However, it's the fact that I did so much damage early and still couldn't close out the game, even when committing extra gates to my attack Nevertheless, in the midgame, I tacked two Colossus and took a decent fight with him at my third, while hitting his natural with a zealot run by By the time I go to him and attack him for the final time, I engage his army in a perfect line, allowing for maximum Colossus carnage but instead I get run over Please explain to me how I can use the tools Proto's has given early to get an advantage, and it still makes no difference in the game Goose Now, he isn't a fan of the goose or anything like that. His name is actually just Purple Goose, a North American player that is in the Master League with 4,300 MMR And the question is, is there an imbalanced, or does Goose suck? and we're going to find out we're going to find out here in this game where we already saw a little bit of chatting Gretzon GM Thank you says ZZZZ Well Purple Goose Probably isn't Grandmaster It looked like a sad congratulations You know It's the jealousy congratulations There's a type of congratulations you give to your 7 year old brother when it's his birthday And you want it to be your birthday because you want the gift, you want to blow out the candle, so you get to do a wish Oh my God. Did you just clear a worker here? With his own worker? That's actually pretty good That's actually impressive, even, I would say It's a good start Actually a good start If you get a kill with a worker, that's always going to be good Let's take a look at the openers here This seems like a I don't know what this is out of the Terran This looks like a gas first But then with a late gas and with a fast second Depot This barracks had the timing of a gas first, but he has the gas of a barracks first So he managed to get the worst of both worlds Fantastic. That is like inventing a plastic straw that deflates like one of these paper straws and bad for the environment, and you can't leave it in your drink for more than two minutes until it's unusable Good job here, this is nice innovation But we're not here to criticize the Terran player We're going to leave that to the people in the comments Instead, we're here to criticize the Protos, and we already have some good material for that Nexus B4 core, a build I usually don't mind, but it is a build I mind if your core is even seven seconds later than it's supposed to be with a Nexus B4 core. On top of that, second pylon in the main base while playing a Twilight Council, this is one of these moves that looks cool, but it's a lot less cool when your opponent attacks you with two, four, six or eight helions or just any amount of helions, because you can't create a wall, and thus helions are going to absolutely kill you This is okay-ish to build a second pylon in the main base if you're opening with a Stargate Because if you're opening Stargate, your opponent plays helions, you can use your phoenixes or your Oracle to deal with the helion But if you're playing Twilight Council, you have to rely on gateway unit. And if you can't wall the helions out of your natural base or out of your main base, you're usually pretty darned that Now, here comes the first adept moving across the map It's going to kill one SUV at least, I guess Yeah, one SUV And maybe even got a second SUV or no, it gets put into that command center There's a big SUV pool It's a good start Twilight Council Late second gate And now would be the timing for the robotics facility if you would want one But instead, I guess we're kind of busy micro-ing over here, our single adapt One kill so far I think he said something that got 10 kills with three units. So, you know, we're going to fact-check that claim, of course So far, four worker kills Marine gets taken out as well This is actually pretty decent control and also a decent start Look at this Terran just now finishing this natural down 10 workers already, not starting SUV production the moment it's possible because the Terran is a little bit confused as to what is going on The Build Order of Protles is absolute chaos as well here We'll have to admit that This robot got thrown down while there was like 280 gas in the bank These gateways are way too late. It feels like a little bit of a disjointed build in a way where I don't quite see the point of all of this, but maybe I'm the idiot here Everything is way too late Oh my God, this adept, I can be serious How's this bad boy still surviving? Is this an armory? Did he just cancel his armory to pull off an SUV, to try and surround the adept? Did not get the adept and then forgot to start the armory up again Yes, that is indeed what happened Two stalkers now also coming in Ten worker kills Nine workers killed by the three units And one worker killed by the probe Oh, might get one more? No There's going to be it. This is going to be it So 10 workers total Yeah Pretty accurate description in the IOTIS form The follow-up here is going to be a six-gate And this was mentioned as well in the first form Now, I would like to talk about the six gate I'm going to pass for it, okay? Because the six gate is not a build Now, people at home might be wondering, Kevin, why is the six gate not a build? Do you not want to all in every now and again? It's like, no, I do want to all in sometimes But building six gates does not actually give you any benefit as opposed to playing with four gates. Because the limiting factor when you're playing 4Gate blink is gas and the more gateways you get early on the less likely it is you can afford your third gas Not too sure if that's the case in this particular game And even if you have these extra gateways you're not mining enough gas to afford and an observer and continuous stalker production and if you cancel an observer your push is a lot worse So going for 6Gate doesn't make this build more aggressive or more all-in, it actually makes the build less all in because you have less money and thus can build less stalkers This is a little bit like buying a taser if your computer doesn't work because you think it requires more power. Even if your computer has a power issue, a taser isn't going to fix it You probably need to do like the supply You can do something different with it I don't know how to make computers Sometimes I get stuck in one of my own analogies due to my own incompetence when it comes to everything that doesn't have to do with Starcraft 2 It's difficult to be relatable and all you do is sit in a room and play StarCraft 2 It's not an easy task, okay? It's a nice drop Armory almost done for it, five minutes and 42 seconds into the game Love to see it. Now I've mentioned this before as well in other videos, but when you're hitting with a four gate blink stalker, usually you hit it like five minutes and eight seconds with 10, 11 stalkers My man purple goose here with this increased power build the 6 Gateway one, is going to be hitting a full minute later without the prism here with no observer and pretty much the same amount of stalker It could also be because just lost the stalker, two stalkers into mines, but let's not mention that for now We're floating 600 minerals the entire way through, which is once again a kind of an impressive feat here Warp in maybe Okay, look look! Exactly what I said was going to happen. Despite the fact that this is extremely late, it still holds through Here you are with your six gateways, but you have to build an observer, and now you can't warp in stalkers out of six gateways because you only have 200 gas Fantastic This is absolutely great Did you just warp three stalkers at home? Oh, to deal with the mine But why three? Surely one stalker would have been good enough I thought this set, 4,300 MMR on the forum Let's take a look at this move again Now the beauty of the blink stalker build, the four gate or the three gate blink stalker, is that you can blink in and then you have a second blink with the prism. So if there's a tank here on the high ground, you can blink in, clear a couple of marines or, I don't know, kill a depot or whatever, and then pick up stalkers that are being attacked with your prism Same thing, if there's mines on the high ground, you can blink in, see that this bad boy gets targeted and pick it up so that your stalker doesn't die The second blink What you can also do is blink into the mines, not take an observer with you, lose two stalkers, deal no damage whatsoever, and then blink out again, which is what I think is going to happen here Yeah I killed a couple of workers, though It's not the end of the world. Observer could definitely help out I would like to see that But what you could also do is wait until these mines come back off of cool down and then just blink into them again That would be an even better move I would not be a fan of that I repeat, I would not be a fan of that This is good though This is actually this is a nice move I'm not quite sure why he blinked a single stalker into that mine but let's pretend that never happened I love this kind of like stun lock down here So like, man, I wish there was a way for me to deal with these invisible mines. If only I had a unit that could detect and at the same time a unit that could outrange the mine, I wish both of these were on this side of the map already, so I wouldn't have to send them there Or I could blink in and then pick it up with the prism There's literally the two ways that I know that you can deal with this problem are both available for purple goose, but purple goose decides, yeah, you know, sounds a little bit difficult Maybe I can blink into a mine into the natural Yeah, I definitely could Very nice Solid stuff here It gets to the bunker at least That's nice Loses two stalkers, kills a bunker and a mine. That's usually what we call not a very good trade Meanwhile, floating 1,400 minerals So we could have thought, perhaps, in a different universe, that Purple Goose's poor micro is because he was busy macroing at home or doing other intelligent things But I think this Nexus went down while there were like 1,700 minerals in the bank There's still 1K in the bank as well He could be triple expanding at this point, and there would be no difference in this game whatsoever, except that he would have a better late game, I guess, and pretty much go into that late game a little bit faster as well I like this charge. I wouldn't mind seeing two forges or three forges going down, or two forges, a robo bay and a fourth base and a fifth base, pylons all around the map I mean, we have plenty of cash anyway This is one of the things I'm not a huge fan of, is blindly warping in eight stalkers because you're too lazy to send your observer for it, which would show the fact that there's absolutely nothing on the map currently for Z and all the units are being left at home Building stalkers at this point is a huge mistake If you're playing Forgate Blink, you don't want to continuously build stalkers You want to continue building stalkers as long as you have potential for damage. The moment you can't deal damage anymore, you don't want to build stalkers anymore, because they cost a lot of gas They delay your future tech because, well, gas reasons And they usually also delay the increase of your infrastructure I guess none of these things are really worried for Purple Goose as he was floating a solid 1K minerals and about 700 gas So I guess warping them in wasn't the end of the world I'm a fan of these triple sentries That's the one thing I actually do kind of like Despite all of these failures that Purple Goose has committed, these crimes against Protos optimized build orders that Purple Goose has committed, he's still really far ahead because of his early game. His early game was actually fantastic And no matter how hard he's trying to throw this game, it just isn't quite working But here's another attempt Up eight workers, double forging right now, tacking into something Probably the worst timing to attack, Purple Goose decides to move out on the map for another mission You absolutely love to see it Now, Combat Shield isn't done for the Terran yet, but this is a pure stalker army, which doesn't work so well against the units Guardian Shield doesn't get used Instead, we get force fields that, well, my seven-year-old dog could do better than this, and my dog has never touched a mouth yet The worst part of all of this is that this was in full vision. It isn't like Purple Goose thought that he was going to have a way bigger army than his opponent No, he completely spotted his opponent's army, the exact state of the game, and decided, you know what? 1-1, not that important The colossus that I'm building, probably not in such a hurry to get there either Let me just throw away a couple of sentries, lose 20 supply for no reason, and then see if I'm still ahead in this game And this actually is the first time in the game where I'm a little bit worried for Purple Goose. Yes, he's still extremely far ahead, but his opponent got infernal pre-igniter so these helions are going to deal more damage okay Al-Qa don't really know what this is the North American ladder has really fallen really taken a bit of a nose dive I've never seen this in my life is this guy meaming Combat Shield has finished up I would not advise attacking here if you're the 10-player Four more sentries Some nice SimCity as well Making sure to block all your own zealots Good probe pull away Making sure to keep all of these probes alive Look at that. Man, it would be awful to keep all those probes mining the moment a massive force invades into the base, wouldn't it? Was this the run-by? Let me read that again In the midgame, I teched to Colossus and took a decent fight with him at my third while hitting his natural with a zealot run-by Well, technically he is hitting his opponent's natural with a zealot run-by, but I'm not quite sure how much damage did this dealt This was what, three SCVs that went down here, losing six zealots I understand that Purple Goose is not a mathematics major, but even he should be capable of understanding that this isn't a fantastic trade. I like that he put that in there as a brag It's a weird one at the same time saying that he took a good fight I mean, he lost like eight, nine workers here Supplies remain pretty close I guess it was a fine fight It wasn't that bad I shouldn't, I shouldn't be negative all the time The fight was fine The salad run by was garbage But just because you did one thing correct doesn't mean you can brag about the others It's like saying that you've aced your test and you hit a wall And then when people see you, they see you with a broken arm It's like, well, that isn't actually something to brag about. You could have just talked about the ace test, because that's what you did You had a decent fight, okay? Now, that doesn't mean you can walk across the map and win the game, because you're not actually as far ahead anymore as you used to be Your opponent's going to get plus two You have two colossi with thermal lands, but there's no ability to quickly reinforce this, as there's no prism On top of that, this is also a pretty bad angle to engage on Despite all of that, I still think you should actually just straight up win here And you actually have a prism Never mind I take everything back No, this actually should be a win Let's take a look at these armies. 22 Marines, 11 marauders, 3 Colossi, 15 stalkers, 19 zealots, 5 centuries Guardian shield and A move Guardian shield and A move That's the future here Maybe a couple of force fields also would be good Could use the stalkers to clear the Vikings rather than to move command for a very long time Okay, there we go One, two I feel like a lot of these moves in this fight We'll go over it once more We're slightly mediocre So it starts okay with a guardian shield I said guardian shield and a move So here we go Guardian shield, A move Now there is two units here in this entire army that can deal with the Colossi They are already floating above the stalkers. A quick right click of about 10 stalkers would clear both of these would clear both of these Vikings in no time and your Colossi are happily shooting forever Guardian Shield gets activated Here we get the first move command Here we get our second move command Making sure that we lose the maximum amount of damage output that we can lose We create a larger concave for our opponent by moving into an area that is more easily surrounded Vikings take out one Colossi, then the Vikings get taken out But at that point the superior upgrades for the Terran actually do well enough that they win the overall fight You were down an upgrade during this You didn't micro at all. Well, you did micro, but everything about it was negative You didn't focus down the Vikings And then on top of that, you also move Command at a couple of time, losing you damage output I actually believe if you would have just pressed Guardian Shield, A moved and then done nothing, it would have been better than what happened just now Probably would have killed every single SV Maybe still would have lost a fight in the end, but I don't actually think so once again just moving down a ramp making sure your opponent has the maximum concave This Terran actually is microing quite well Moving back and forth with the Marauders, having the Vikings in, well, in a position, I guess. Okay, the micro actually also isn't fantastic and it doesn't really matter And now you're dead Back to two bases You wish you had a 1200 mineral bank right now, but those days are over Matterfax completely empty for the tavern this game is fairly over I don't know how to win I thought I was ahead that whole game both of these statements are correct he doesn't seem to know how to win and he also probably was ahead the whole game despite his obvious attempts to sabotage himself I I just don't entirely know what to say to this either This is someone that got very lucky early in life This man won the lottery when he was three. And by the time he was 19, he lost all of his money and started complaining about financial troubles again That's pretty much what happened in this game He's playing against someone that is better than him, but was really far behind And then eventually lost by taking worse fight, having inferior macro, having a worse understanding of what to upgrade, what unit compositions, where to fight, basically all decision-making, harassment was better out of the terrain as well, despite him constantly being down in supply Like literally everything in this game was worse than your opponent I understand why you lost It's because your opponent is 500 MMR above you and you killed 10 SVs, so you felt like you deserve to win. but that's not really how it works It's like me starting against Bolt on a racetrack, 25 meters ahead Then when he runs past me, he's like, oh, how did I lose? Well, because Bolt spent his teens and his, well, his 20s practicing running, while I spent it pressing hotkeys on my keyboard at a very high pace It's like, yeah, I'm not that surprised that he managed to beat me, and you shouldn't be so surprised either Everything about your game was just off This had nothing to do with Terran being in balance, or Taryn being difficult to kill. I agree that often it's frustrating if you get a lead against Taryn, it's hard to kill them, but you didn't do any of the correct moves You didn't try to send in a prism You didn't try to extend your lead or get a better composition by maybe adding disruptors in or even adding Rokons in Note there were no ghost in your opponent's army You've created what? You created 12 centuries this game with three still alive You've invested 1,500 gas in centuries In my average PVT game, I invest about, 100 or 200 gas in sentries I try to keep them alive and I'll rebuild one maybe in some situations just for a guardian shield. But most of my guess is otherwise going into either tech upgrades or better units, disruptors for like air or arcons Like the sentry is not a good late game unit You spent your entire game building mediocre units, taking bad fights with bad upgrades And then you get your butt handed to you and you complain That's not cool my friend, you suck Terran's not imbalanced I'm sorry That's the way it is All right That's going to be it for me today Thanks also much for watching We did enjoy this episode of is it Inba or Do I Suck? If you did, don't forget to the like button, subscribe to the channel and I'll see all of you next time for a new video. Be sure to leave down in the comments what you thought of this game, but you believe the Taryn player or sorry, the Protos player could have done better and I'll be curious to read it Thanks so much for watching and bye-bye."

        "text": "Most esteemed Baron, Captain Kevin Harstam the Konig Welcome to the Great King Lurker's coronation ceremony I am a humble protos follower of the Great King Lurker Have 38 MMR in the Korean server and 4200 in the late Chinese server Rest in peace In this game, I had a not bad early game and a perfect midgame I scouted my opponent's Hydra Bainling all in and dealt with it flawlessly I eliminated my opponent's Hydra's and Bainling without casualties, so I had a huge advantage in the middle game My oracles were well preserved I had good map control, a powerful high-tech army including Colossus and Disruptor A healthy economy Fast upgrades. My opponent's economy got this hit pretty bad by my zealot run by, 5 to 4 bases and 80 to 60 workers I'm sure what that means, but I'm sure we'll get to it And I had 3 robo to produce Colossus and Disruptor, 2 Stargate to produce Carrier to produce carrier But all of this was destined to burn daylight because the king lurker backed The king, he is just like invisible tank, running speed higher than Phoenix, reproducing faster than virus The king landed my base, then my strong army immediately disappeared, just like tears in rain It was then that I realized that Protos could not challenge the authority of the king lurker G G. Alas, my esteemed Baron harsed him, do you think as I do that the Great King Lurker will reign over this Coprulu sector or just at least in this game? It was, I suck Please make the most judge judgment Amorphism sent me this balance complaint from a true poet The strong army disappeared like tears in rain, so if StarCraft isn't his thing, then perhaps poetry is the future asking me if the Great King Lurker or the Lurker is imbalanced or if he sucks Let's find out Alright, there we go Amorphism versus Frozen And this is not going to be anything like the Disney movie, at least Can't imagine it being anything like the Disney movie Can't remember Lurkers being in the Disney movie. How sick would that be though? Imagine you have your Disney movie, your Lion King, your Aladdin is Disney as well Frozen is Disney And then all of a sudden, you know, just when everything comes together, a lurker shows up, kills the protagonist God Imagine explaining that one to your kid What happened to Elsa? What is that beast from underground? Adios, my friend Splash damage as well Takes out the Prince Charming or whoever else is There's no Prince Charming, I think, in Frozen I think the Prince actually was a bad person I remember watching it When I went to WCS in 2015, because this player called Hydra, who was winning a lot. And he was like, hey, we're going to watch a movie with some of the players here Do you want to join us? I was like, yeah, sure, sounds good But I've been watched Frozen because I'd never seen it before Surprisingly decent movie It's a 6-7 pro gamers watching Frozen Time of my life Anyway, that's not what we're here for sharing old anecdotes What we're here for is a game of StarCraft 2. and that is starting out not so great Stargate timing 41 gas in the bank probe queued up and because that probe was queued up not enough money to start the Stargate and does the Stargate for no reason whatsoever is about 7 to 8 seconds too late which is kind of a lot if you're in the early game 3,800 MMR on Korea I feel like I expect expected a little bit more at least So yeah, fairly disappointing for a start Now, we have a couple of links coming over right now They're going to chase away this probe So the scout is okay They didn't actually see the third base either The adeptase the other side. Ooh, might get a kill on one of these links These links are completely out of position or even better Might go in and kill a couple of drones here I have to wait and see how that's going to end up panning out This is a wall and it's a correct wall Love to see that I'm a big fan of people that are below 5K MMR producing, you know, correct walls That's the content that I subscribe to I could watch Diamond players make beautiful walls all day if I wanted to Just makes me happy when a wall comes together in the end Built a final building and boom, just like that it's done. Oracle on the way, so fairly standard openers here for both players Third player, but decided to not throw down any creep tumors If creep is overrated, perhaps handicapping himself a little bit Oh, links around I wonder if the Orubu could be like a body blocker, you know? Put the Orubu in front of your adept You always just hug it so that links can get a proper surround I don't think that would work Ooh, that's a fast road for it What about that's going to be for? It's a late third base I wonder why that is I think I know the answer though Probably because you forgot to send out the probe That's the adept That's another dead adapt. We do get the Nexus up Nah, not that great of a trade Oracle also idling completely Second Oracle's on the way This stalker should survive No, it shouldn't It dies Wow This actually is kind of a big deal There's a lot of units lost here for amorphism It's going to stand in this Oracle, but double queens are in position So she's going to take some hull damage, scout, and see, hey, you know, I can actually deal damage there Takes out one drone, takes even more damage Tried flying into two more queens Not a great start Kill two workers, lost one, but lost a bunch of units as well. The only thing that I find a bit bad for the Zirke is that he built 14 more Lings If that wasn't the case, Zirk would be a heading workers right now, a fairly good position as the tech is super late for no real reason whatsoever It's a fairly confusing game at the moment Another surround This is turning into a stalker-adept graveyard over here I still don't like these 14 links being produced They're paying off, but they shouldn't have So I think it, like, theoretically this was a bad call StarCraft isn't really a pure theory game, but theoretically this was a bad call, so I didn't like it I do like these eight extra drones being produced Extractor on the way. We have no layer yet I don't know, we do have a layer No fort base Now we get a hydrodron and a bailing nest at the same time, and that fast rotor doesn't get used at all It's a confusing early game here, in general I'm not even quite sure who's ahead It should be the Zerk, but it doesn't quite seem to be the case Triple Oracles also haven't really achieved all that much They killed as many workers as the 20 lynx that have been built have So not quite ideal Massive oversaturation as well What did he mention again? He played some Denied the HydroLink Bainawin is what he said That's the scout on the HydroLink Bain all in It's fairly obvious as well. There's like no gases here, no fort base You're like, oh, what is going on? Surely units are being built So you add some gateways You add two cannons Three cannons? I think three cannons is pushing it a little bit You're not outmining your opponent by that much So what are these positions? It's like you're not really ready for anything They come from the right side I guess you have kind of two cannons Come from here You have like half a cannon This is a weird chimpsity in general This cannon isn't protected This cannon isn't protected This is also an open area This is like the opposite of walling This is just building structures almost adjacent to each Look at this. None of this is connected This is insane No, there's a fight going on here The base is going to get cancelled An idiot can see that coming Look at this This is a hole? There's a hole in between this There's a hole here and there's a hole here There's more entrances to this base right now than there was before he started walling it off This is an impressive feat as well No cancel Triple upgrades for the Zerk This is an odd Hydroling Baynall in the Zerk well Still no gases being taken Another cannon got added and more pylons. Okay, so a little bit of theory here is that usually as a Protoss player you want to defend the buildings that either deal damage or that have low HP behind Gateways So Gateways in front, Pylons behind it Gateways in front, Cannons behind it Gateways in front, Shield Batteries behind it Right now we're seeing Cannons and Pylons in front at the freaking exact same pixel as well over here Why is this the only thing that is completely walling? And then between the Pylon and the Gateway and these two Gateways, there's space for Banelings to run by I don't quite understand that Seems like a mistake It also seems like a mistake to not take gases here and to invest freaking infinite minerals into these Cannons. Like you're making more money than your opponent, but if you're allocating it this poorly into this many cannons It doesn't actually matter if you make that much This is as if you make 5K a month, your neighbor makes 3K a month, but you spend $3,600 on candles It's like, yeah, your neighbor's probably going to be driving a better car after that or a nicer car, and there's really not that much as you can say about it It's waste a crap ton of cash, and it's the same in this game Nice map vision as well a second Wait a second I had good map control. Now, when you say map control, that often means that you're in control of the map and that you can see things coming If you're in control of the map, you can, for example, have a zealot here, a zealot here, and a zealot over here, without them being contested So you get vision from it Map control Map control is just having control of the map and being able to maintain that vision and being allowed to move out on the map Having map control isn't being in your opponent's face If you're al-inning your opponent, you do not necessarily have map control That's not the same thing. Right now what you're doing is you're practically al-inning your opponent, despite you being al-in by an army that is running by you at the moment This is, this is not map control This is having an army on the opponent's side of the map And that is very different from map control And I think you got your definitions mixed up, or you truly believe that you were in control But then how did this happen? You got really lucky with the stasis And you also got lucky that your opponent's army was terrible If your opponent had played a real build, you would have died Fact Actual fact Triple Oracle is still alive, so that was true You're also just honestly ahead at this point. I find it difficult to imagine a world in which you lose or die Well, dying is impossible because you have right now six cannons We just keep adding more and more cannons This cannon has five kills None of these other cannons have any kills though So it's a nice efficiency on there Good return of investment Now you're building a Colossus one at a time as well as a Templar archive So that's some foresight I want to see those force shields again Okay Right clicking the hatchery Losing some stalkers Nice counterattack Not force fielding this ramp Then pretending like it is force fielded and just right-tracking the base anyway That is a very cool move That is actually a very, very cool move. I sometimes do that as well with my girlfriend when I'm the one in charge of doing the dishes of doing the dishes, or with my wife, when I'm the one in charge of doing the dishes, and then I didn't do it, and then I pretend like I did do it Usually it doesn't end as well for me as it ended up here for amorphism, when he faked the force fields and then just right-click the hatchery anyway Hide here A couple of blinkstalkers, and this is still completely over this game It's actually impossible to lose You have the ultimate counter right now, the Colossus against the Hydra Ling The only thing, it's an interesting blink for it, but doesn't matter. There's so many units, it literally doesn't matter It is, I actually believe this game to be impossible to lose Ford base is late and once again we have, how can someone build such a beautiful wall in the natural? And then whenever it comes with, what is this? The Swiss are jealous because you manage to put so many holes in it What is this? It's like there's literally holes everywhere Do it, Lord All right, you're still on the map though, and you're winning Now I do have to warn you is that Colossi are a trick Okay, the Colossus is a tech unit that gets outdated pretty quickly It is a little bit like how the DVD was the DVD was. You know, you had VCR, then there was like three years of DVD and then Blu-ray came out If during that time you started like a pure DVD shop and you stayed with DVD forever, you'd probably be bankrupt at this point That's kind of what the Colossus is The Colossus is a transitional device like the DVD was, you know? Most people got a PlayStation 3, DVDs were over It's time to get Blu-rays, my friends And it's the same with Colossus You get, you get them for a little bit, I feel like you've had them slightly long already at this point You need to move on in life Get into this Ruppters, get into Templar Archives I like that a lot Wouldn't mind seeing Storm. Wouldn't mind seeing a fifth base either here at this point, as well as a prism I'm a huge fan of this zealot, like a little setup over here So you attack into this area and you send your zealots in This would work better if your opponent didn't have lurkers borrowed It also would work better if you looked at where you send them in but I can blame me for this I do this a lot as well Just send in six out I hope they do something If they don't, that's life Ooh, this is a good move, too Got lucky there that there was no target fire on the observer Never mind Observer gets taken out anyway Some units randomly die on the left. This is still all completely fine I still truly believe that this game is un-loseable There's no creep There is seven lurkers without seismic spines, and there's two vipers out The only way I can imagine you're losing right now is, getting every single major unit abducted And there's a simple fix for this The Templar archives Warped in a couple of Templar Make sure that your units don't get abducted And you probably win the game the moment you manage to attack into Stargate Now, the thing with a four-base zirchis here is that he's on eight gases Lurker, Vipers and Hydras all cost a crap ton of gas. So out of eight gases, yes, you can build Lurker Hydra Viper, but you're not going to be capable of maxing out easily Look at that Gas count low, mineral count high The thing that you can't get is corruptors It is really difficult, practically impossible, to get Lurker Hydra Viper corruptor out of eight gases So if you ever manage to attack into Stargates, corruptors will not be out, which means if you play Carrier Templar and you clear the Vipers ahead of time, you win This is the reason why Lurker's are relatively bad It's because they are like a DVD but have even a shorter time in which they're relevant They're actually kind of like a colossus in that way. They just don't remain relevant for that long This is a good fight again by you, by the way Salads being sent in This is way better as long as you don't aim of them into a spore Yeah, two of them do that The rest, just idols over here Okay, if you're going to idle over here, I probably would have preferred aim moving into the spore I take back what I said about the spore No, never mind You're controlling them Okay I love this I absolutely love this Fifth base on the way once again. SimCity that well I what is this walling off I would the cannons are still completely attack like just build the two cannons in here another gateway in front boom you have a wall or just one gate here one gate here cannon cannon something like this what is this it's like you learned how to wall by looking at box art I was wrong with you Holy crap Salad Rumbai is good though Okay, yeah, it was 80 workers to 60, 5 base versus 4 I think I understood the imbalance complaint from correctly. Going into Storm now finally, would love to see some Templars being warped in as well because Storm by itself doesn't do a whole lot if you don't have a Templar that can cast it And the most important thing isn't really storm because you have disruptors for splash against the Hydras I think the most important thing really here is just the feedback on the Vipers That way your carriers can see stay alive If your carrier stay alive, you win the game There's nothing that can contest the carrier There's simply cannot have enough high rush for that It's impossible Probably do want to get rid of the stalkers. If you're really getting stuck into a crap army at this point, and you want to make sure your opponent never manages to walk across the map 13 gateways, which means that base trading is fairly easy at this point You have extremely good production The setup is perfect, except for your SimCity But the setup is perfect You also have, Do you really have map control? I'm not sure if I'd consider this map control, but you have some vision on the map with Stasis Ward Vipers moving in Stasers are good Articles are being blasted at a high pace Look at that Oh my God Cannon's got a kill Nice Viper gets taken out Hydra lurker moving forward. Stas and Swartz have really paid the dividends in this game so far I see the resource lost 14k to 10k Look this Bam, bam, bam, bum Poof Oh, both of them died, unfortunate Poof Kill two lurkers Okay No feedback Still no feedback It's an interesting dance here in the lurker spikes This is the first fight I wasn't so happy with Both of the disruptor shots missing as well there But I guess in some way it freed up a little bit of supply here to create more carriers There is triple stargates So I'm sad to only see two working Zadadrambi gets used at the same time is actually keeping your opponent back as well I guess this is the point where you're most vulnerable. This is the only point at which you can lose Okay, you're in the middle of a transition to air You just lost a large amount of your army and your opponent has a lot of lurkers, which you're not entirely ready for yet The thing that you want to be doing right now is keeping your opponent back while you're throwing away cheap, dispensable units The zealot If you warp in 10 zealots over here, your opponent will be forced to send a significant force back home in order to deal with that, which means, in turn, that you're not going to get attacked Or if you get attacked by a weak force, there's only five hydras in here in general, and you still have four carriers. Never mind, you're completely safe It's actually impossible for you to lose this game There is 10 hydras extra on the way, and they're going to have three, two upgrades, which is somewhat significant But there's only five hydras right now you could just clear them with your carriers and from that point on out you just clear the lurkers after there's an interesting start of the fight you managed to lose one carrier against five hydras four hydras there was one in the back there's every single disruptor that just went down and then half of your no two-thirds of your carriers are attacking roaches over the hydra in the back This is a fantastic fight This was wonderful. So a thing I often say, the thing I often do is when you're not sure about why you lost a fight, you can watch it back in slow motion and you can find your mistakes because sometimes it's difficult to understand what you did wrong For you, it's going to be the opposite here, amorphism It is very difficult for me to understand what you did correct Mistakes are going to be plentiful, but my goal in rewatching this fight is not pointing out your mistakes They're going to be obvious We will just play it through I might click at things and I might look funny into the camera when weird things happen But I'm truly looking for things you did correct Revelation. I like that you cast revelation Revelation provides vision of the lurkers, which means that right now at this moment, you know how many lurkers are in position and you can make the correct decisions on that information you just gained You didn't use Super Battery Now, that sounds like criticism, but this pylon actually was very exposed So using Super Battery on this battery could have potentially been energy wasting and cool down wasting So although this is not necessarily a good move, this we could consider it as perhaps in an alternate universe a good move So that's two good moves already in this fight. You damage your opponent so that if you get splash damage on it later on, they'll all die at the same time, which gives a very satisfying sound Three things you've done correct Yeah, I think that's it I'm trying my best here, but it's not easy Yeah Yeah I just feel like there was no micro at all here Now we're getting some zealots This is going to be a good disruptor shot And get some units, that's good That's all you really need is one disruptor shot on hydras during the entire fight or just all carriers attacking the same group of hydras That also would have been good enough, I think You can go back to regular speed. Even at this point, despite all your shortcomings, despite all of your shortcomings, I think you're still in a playable, if not winning position Let's think about it here for a second So what do you have? You have a lot of gateways, superior income, you have carriers out with two more on the way, zealot runbyes are available and Zirk is still only on, what is it, seven gas right now Trying to take 10 or trying to take 9, but you have plenty of bases and superior income All you need to do is keep your opponent back, get disruptors, carriers and Templar out That's it Zellets for the runbyes to keep your opponent back and then the rest of your units Look at this. This base completely empty This base completely empty Five zealots would either force his army back or would clear an entire base And trading a base for a base at this point is probably pretty good because you have more bases than your opponent You have six, your opponent has five On top of that you're trying to rebuild So anything that waste time is also good This is honestly It looked like the star of perhaps a good fight It could have been a good fight Oh, maybe a Vias! A feedback We hit a feedback That was very nice So one Viper doesn't get to use all its energy I guess. As a Zirk player, if you're playing against someone that consistently throws Archon for free in your army, perhaps abducting units isn't even the most important thing in the world anymore This, despite those mistakes out of the toss, I still think this is a doable fight Oh, the DT is actually a good call I like that call of the DTs I want to split Yes There we go Beautiful Still have some observers as well Can clear every single lurker Actually a hat Actually a hat Don't forget to pick up your free three lurkers over here, my friend Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Three three lurkers Hey We have observers ready and everything We were seeing it Warping in a DT and a zealot. That's not going to do it because one Lurker is out of vision, every single probe is dying Going from an eco advantage here into an eco disadvantage Still ahead Still winning Foccing down that extractor real good while Lurker was killing your Arcon Cool move Yeah, keep right-clicking the hatchery with the Colossus He used to stay alive, Ling run by to the left Very nice People often ask me, Kevin, what do you think is impossible? And I say, nothing is impossible But I thought that I finally had a game where I could say, I thought it was impossible to lose this one But even that is not the case any even that is not the case anymore Amorphism, prove me wrong. Everything from start to finish Once the fighting started, it just ended The moment the fighting started, in which it was important that you didn't just aim or move command in, or it wasn't good enough anymore that right-click in an extractor, you know? I just feel like everything went wrong The fight over here, I've never seen something like this in my life Legitimately never Just move command that Seven, eight disruptors lost a carrier against like four hydras before the fight even started, then attacked roaches with carriers, stormed their own interceptors after the roach over here had practically died There were so many things that went wrong The entire fight was complete chaos. You can have material advantages all you want, but if this is how you control it, it doesn't really matter you literally lost everything into a way inferior army That was in a good position That's the only thing that the Zerk did That was scary this game is move into a good position with 16 lurkers and 5-6 hydras with like 10 hydras as reinforcements But that was it After that there was not going to be anything You could have given up this base You could have counter-attacked You could have just used your carriers to clean up the hydras initially and use your disruptors from a distance. There are so many things you could have done, but instead you move commanded your entire ground army into the lurkers without dealing any damage whatsoever. I think two disruptors might have even hit absolutely nothing, and another disruptor hit two lurkers that weren't damaged yet. I honestly think the rest of the game wasn't even that bad. I think your transitions were somewhat timely. Yes, I didn't like the Colossi here in the late game. Yes, I think your Templar were a little bit late in the fight, but it was good enough for your level, definitely. It's just the one fight completely destroyed you. I don't think that had much to do with the lurkers either. Like, the lurker is one of the only units there that probably could have won, but you already had the counter in the carrier So this, I feel like something that would help you more than, rather than a lurker nerve, is just maybe adding a second control group, or adding a control group altogether, because it feels like you're just F2ing at this point There's really had nothing whatsoever to do with the, the lurker being in balance, and more so with you just move commanding in And that my dear friend means that you suck And that's going to be it I'm sorry, but that's life All right. That is also going to be it for me in today's episode of, is it imba or do I suck? Where sadly we had another sucker I don't enjoy saying any of this You know that, right? My friends, I really don't I'd rather have things be in balance as well Makes me feel good about myself as a pro-os player Why do I lose all the time? Oh, I suck No It's because the lurker is in balance I would have wanted it, but it wasn't meant to be All right Thanks everyone so much for watching I hope you did enjoy it. If you did, don't forget the like, but subscribe to the channel, and hopefully I'll see all of you next time for a new video Bye-bye."

        "text": "Dear Harstam Sainse, Thor is Inba Or would I say mutas are really, really weak against it Muta's winning chance against Thor with a couple of Marines were about less than 10% On this game, my opponent managed to do damage first on my third base It literally destroys it But I managed to do the attacks after that with my Nidus Swarmost on his main base But it doesn't do much damage There I follow up my attacks with Mutas Then Muras and Swarmhost combination I tried to pressure him as much as I could I do manage to destroy his third CC and second CC at his natural Also kill most of his SCVs and mules on both natural and main base. I also managed to destroy his armory But before that happened, he already produced a single Thor and then it started to get ugly I miscontrolled my mutas to his single thor and nothing is left to my muras After that, he counterattack with his remaining Marines, single Thor and a single tank I tried to switch with Hydras and fight with my remaining swarmost, but since there's a Thor in his army, my locus got wiped out easily and I lose the game Tell me Harstam Sensei, is Muras that weak and Thor is just imba? Or do I just suck? This was sent in by Raiju, a 2663 MMR gold player from the European server The question is simple. Are Thor imbalanced? Or does he suck? We're going to find out The first thing I want to recommend is perhaps a creative writing course I've seen the word after about 30 times in that one complaint form It makes it very difficult to read So that's my first suggestion before we even get into the game here This is Raiju versus Pimki, Terran versus Zerk on ancient cistern So you have a nice little wall starting for Pimki immediately I'm always a little bit afraid, you know, when you get in gold territory, and anything below platinum, really That's the It scares me I'm just going to be real Oftentimes, the early game just isn't as sound as I would like it to be. It becomes difficult for me to kind of keep a straight This is It's already starting An 18 hatchery that goes down at 19 supply Floating 400 minerals Like this is This is the type of stuff It just It creates a pit in my stomach You know, I feel it and it doesn't feel right I just I don't want that Okay, spawning pool Evo chamber Classic hatch first into Evo chamber cancel Into spawning pool again Very nice So, hatchery too late Spawning pool too late Extractor actually got built before the hatchery is what I saw as well So this is already a build order and a half. It's one of these things that the first three buildings, if they don't get put down at the correct timings, I don't think that is right I just don't think that is right You don't necessarily need to follow a build order up to five minutes, but have the first two minutes down All right, it started easy For a circuit's really just three buildings Like there's no thought process here You need to know when to build your first overlord, 13 supply, and then you need to know when you build your hatchery, your extractor and your pool That's really it And it is fairly easy You don't have to do a lot of thinking. You don't have to, you know, do any tricks with like worker micro No walling is required as Zerk either So there's no thought process in there But please get the first two minutes Correct It's all I ask of you, Raju It's all I ask Right now we have one Overlord too many already, as we're on 44 supply That means that our third base is never going to be built either in time Now, it's a third base is already too late at this point So Reactor opener coming out of the Tarran into a three-recks Okay, this is not entirely how the build is supposed to be played, but you can see that the start was okay. The command center timing is four seconds late, but that I can live with It's better than having it, well, was it like 20, seconds late It's going to be a three wrecks pressure over here Stim combat shield most likely, so I kind of like that I'm already digging the way that Staron is playing a lot more for now It's going into four queens before third hatchery This is definitely a build order The funny thing, though, is that despite the complete lack of a build order, the overlord positioning is kind of good Like every overlord is being sent out into some type of location Like these are being sent around They're spotting for proxies Links are actually checking if there's a third base. Like, is this the one thing he focused on? It's like how sometimes you see these guys with the massive biceps, you know, just the biceps Rest of the body completely normal And also only the right arm bicep is absolutely huge That's the only thing Man, that has some very specific training that they have been doing It feels like that Riju here is doing the same thing Because his build order is suboptimal And his macro is not great either, but the vision on the map Look at this Every overlord has a position And these are new maps as well Like, you can maybe expect this from like a diamond two-pleasure. player after playing on the same maps for two seasons straight because Blizzard forgot to upload the maps again But I don't know This is actually pretty sick He sees moveouts He sees where there's a third and he can sacrifice his overlord, which is indeed, what is this? It's like a sacrificial ground or something Like if they ever capture a Zircling, they're going to lock it into this depot, this depot jail and have a marine shoot at it until it has one H and then the Marine walks away Constantly on the edge of thinking you're going to die This is the Terran Torture Chamber, my friends Welcome aboard Or maybe he wants to put a critter in here That's also possible. Actually, on this map, you have the Where are you? The Tasty Lobe and the Artosi Lobe Obviously, that's to do with Tasteless and Artosis And you can force them into a direction If you get close with a unit, they run away very fast So maybe you could force them into the jail keep them there and start like a Terran zoo or something like that I have planned Okay, I'm gonna make a Turkey zoo, okay? You can't kill them You can't kill the turkey that's locked in here, okay? That's my zoo I'm gonna see if I can get more in by sometimes lowering the depot It would be possible This is another thing. Investation pit and a spire at the same time, an ungodly combination Also, what the heck are those creep tumors? This is like having pineapple on toothpaste Not good Trust me, I tried But why? You know, when you had all these pineapple debates whether it would be good on pizza I was like, well, it's okay on pizza, it's not awful And I started trying things they were truly awful Pineapple with toothpaste Pineapple, just putting it in your drink drink Pineapple in tea is actually surprisingly not bad Makes it a little bit sweeter Something I do recommend Does he have the Stim combat? Yeah Okay Stim combat. This build is hitting about a minute late, but it's not an issue because currently there's only a single ling out for Raiju, who despite all of his scouting hasn't figured out that he needs to build some units to defend against his opponent It's floating six larvae right now And is starting a NIDIS network in the phase of danger Oh, actually, this is not even a proper three days with Matax as well This is almost a real build I'm not sure why we're what we're waiting for, but I guess there's bigger things going on right now Just setting his army in Oh, there we go I mean, this is just a cleaner What? I never understand this. How is it possible that these builds and these plays are so bad, but then we're seeing transfuse and stutter-step micro Like, this literally doesn't make any sense This entire game has been disaster, especially from the Zerk so far, who's floating 2 8K resources, 7 minutes into the game, and decided to open with Ling Queen Swarmhost Nidus Spire, and has the sickest overlord spread in the world Does stop the drop but loses the third base Not really an issue I think actually losing a base here might be good because it makes you look at your minerals and say, hey, I have too many minerals, maybe I need to throw down four extra hatcheries. You know, so you can actually spend your money a little bit Although larva are around, it's just that money isn't being spent You know what this game so far kind of reminds me of? I have a four and a half year old cousin who's been playing football as of later, like a local club And I sometimes go and watch It'll be a supportive uncle Hold up Wait a minute I have a four and a half year old cousin And I sometimes go and watch to be a supportive uncle Supportive uncle Majority of the time is just spent counting blades of grass or perhaps philosophizing philosophizing. Thinking about the philosophy or whether counting, you know, blades of grass is a word while use of your time And not a whole lot of time is actually spent thinking about how to get the ball or to keep it in possession or to get the ball to the opposite end of the goal And it feels like that Riju is doing the same thing He's more of an explorer here, you know, seeing different parts of the map, exploring different tech trees at similar times He's doing everything at once, but also doing nothing at once He's a little bit of a monk in a way, you know? He's not any of the existing religions yet. He still is figuring out exactly what his religion is supposed to be, just like he's still trying to figure out what this game is exactly supposed to be So we just had a Swarmhouse Nydis enter the main base I love that the thought of a Swarmhouse Nydis having to go in the main base as well, by the way The one advantage that the Swarmos has with the Flying Locus is that the, The nidus can be here, and then the locusts fly in And then the locust timer is like 35 seconds, so they're going to stay alive forever anyway It doesn't really matter if they have three less seconds. Instead of that, you expose the nidus into the main, and you also kind of make it dangerous for the swarmos to pop out And the transition is into mess muras, and there's 12 marines against 12 muras And I guess that is basically game over Or stim? No? I love that he wanted to finish this tech lab It's like, yeah, sure there's Marines with 1-1 attacking my Muras, but maybe if I sniped this tech lab here on this factory, nothing bad will happen to them It's an interesting engagement as well I'm not entirely sure about the fight you want to be taking with Muras, but I do believe that killing two SEVs to lose seven Muras is usually not worth it. And then sniping two more turrets Actually, if the game is just over How many meters have gone down? Eight, nine This is literally one of the worst games I've seen in my life, I think Sloding 5K resources as well The weird thing is, is that I don't Like, the Terran doesn't feel as bad in a way You know, he spending his money better It just He had an actual build order, killed the third base I don't quite understand why the Terran is losing and why he's down 80 supply Maybe I do now that these Marines decided not to go for the Nidas Mura's coming back in again as well The actual control of the units at this point isn't even that bad. But why is none of the money being spent? And why are we building Why did we go up to 55 workers if we can't even spend money while our eco consists of 30 workers? That is one of the questions I have If you can't spend the money, why even BOT are getting more work? I like this knightess This is a good knightess Swarmost are still alive There's zero upgrades though, and 1-1 has already finished for the Terran But there's also only 23 Marines against 20 Muras and 7 Swarmost I find it difficult to believe Maybe Raiju actually isn't aware of the fact that Evo Chambers exist. That's why he was so shocked in the early game when he accidentally opened with an Evo first I was like, oh no, what is this? That can produce any units Useless building If Raju was in control of the army, they would not be upgrading their weapons They would just be increasing the amount of weapons that they have So he'd be fighting like the first World War with clubs With a lot of clubs He has thousands of them More of this No, he doesn't know how to attack I think it's a fight you can take now 18 mutas against 14 Marines Maybe flying into two turrets is better I like the call Actually, it was a good call, as well End up killing SUVs. Flying around with the mutas So 2-2 has started 19 Marines This is a very unlikely game to lose The thing right now is, is that if you look at this, is that there's enough money to literally afford anything that you want in the world Like, at this point, Ryju could be tacking into a hive to get an ultralist cavern He could be getting a hydra then to get lurkers out He could be throwing down a bailing nest for balings A roach warrant for roaches Like, none of these are necessarily good transitions, but they're probably better than getting more mudas against the pure marine Thor army There's not even a single Meneat at this point. This is legitimately pure marine and a single marine, single Thor and a tank that is on the way These units are about to have to, too Okay, natural CC is going to be taken out I remember it's saying that in the imbalance complaint form Look at this Overlux spread is insane Creep spread not as great We have about, what is this? 9K 9K resources in the bank right now extra gases, six more drones He's like, ah, this is the level of prioritization that I need in my life I have actually no clue what's going on Okay, I want to see this again Okay, so right now we're just making sure that this Ovalour is still spotting the exact same area. Then we add two extractors while we're losing all of our mutas, of course, on the other side of the map And it's like, okay, let me think My opponent is on seven workers I'm on three bases and have a bank of 9 5K resources What would be the best use of my larva? And somehow some way my men Ryju managed to get to the drone When you're ahead, get more ahead As the best call Six drones on the way here Start injecting again Maybe he wants to add five extra hatcheries for more production Just send these over towards your third base That's fine Ford base, boom Get it on the way He actually has two different modes. He has like a macro mode and a unit control mode And I think for the first 13 minutes and 45 seconds, we've just been in the unit control mode And now our entire focus is actually just on macro Okay, here come eight more Swarmos Does he still have Swarmost? Yeah, he still has 10 So he's going to go up to 18 Swarmose That hurts Wait, what? What hurt? I mean, there is no way, right, that Pimki You think he said it about this? I'm gonna, okay, we'll speed through this This is first person view, by the way This was the slowest response I've seen to an event happening Like, what is this? This is the type of response. He's going to start crying tomorrow because George Harrison died It's like, what? John Lennon got shot He's a legit minute late Interesting Okay, here comes the transition that we've heard about The Hydra transition It's like, okay, what is good against Mass Marine? Surely Hydros, I find 18 more Swarmost on the way Okay, 28 swarms Actually, think if you just sent 28 locust into this army, don't you just win the game? Am I incorrect, thinking that you just straight up win the game? If you're, ah, he's going to counterattack with it Ah, I gotcha I'm not sure if that's the greatest player there is. Probably want to defend your massive drone league that you have, your massive eco lead that you have, your massive eco lead your massive bank as well This seems like a wild game There go four Swarm Hosts for free That's how it starts Now we get nine hydras out No lurker den yet I feel like if you're Raiju in this situation and you realize your struggle with getting larvae Actually, he's not even struggling getting larva He's just not using all of his larvae for whatever reason I don't understand it Okay, here come two Swarm Hosts Yes, use them two at a time I love that Okay, comes the next Swarm Host wave Clears what? Three, four, five, six Marines or so Still completely destroying this game. He's so far ahead that he could be building pure hatcheries and roguards around the map and eventually just win Also, of course, you still have 22 swarm hose If you use all of these at the same time at any point, I also think you win the game The thing is that there's, what, eight swarm hosts in this Nidus network, and I'm afraid that Riju actually has forgotten about them You have a ninja base? This is not the time for small talk, my friend You're in a knife fight Your life is on the line You start asking where this guy bought his blade He's like, oh, that looks real nice and shiny. Use any special oils to, you know, keep it in such good condition? He also just responds Like, this is in life for that situation You're fighting with each other Gigi, no! This is not Gigi This is the most surreal game I've seen in my life Why are both of them so casual about everything? So mules are really imba? Yes The real problem in this game for Raiju was the lack of money that he had And the fact that Terran was too rich Resources lost 18K This is a fairly normal resources lost But you still have Well, this is like 9K resources in the bank in the bank Like a bit? Pimki is also agreeing I'm not sure if Pimki is just being nice. This chat is actually triggering me These are the guys that agree with each other on Reddit when I have a good balance take and they disagree with me Pimki comes to the rescue of Raju when Ryju says Harsim doesn't know anything about the game I was totally all in on that I thought I lost I will submit to Harsdam Yes That was a good plan Thor help against Mutha I'm not sure if the Thor actually did that much It was 2-2 Marines against 11 Muras The Marines are kind of the counter to the Mutha The Mutas is not really supposed to fight You have the bailings for that G-G G-G- well played Now I was looking for the. Probably Googling how to leave a game I miscontrolled my mutas Yeah, we saw that as well This is a surreal conversation when macroing my bases Actually, majority of the mutas were lost where you were looking at the Ovalord over here overseeing the green space on the right side of the map for your future as a gardener It's like, I know it's good to have a plan for the future because definitely StarCraft isn't working out, but while you're in a muta fight, you probably don't want to do that This, I actually have nothing to say I don't even know, I don't even think Riju himself believes that this was in balance He started by saying that it was mules that were imba. And then when his opponent said the Tor helped against the mutas, you could see like the cockwheels spinning and it said, I'm like, ah, Thor against Muta That was the issue, huh? And then he even himself, he offers a little bit of wisdom where he says, yes, I lost my Mura's while I was macroing my bases They just miscontrolled them He knows it himself The Mura is not a unit that is supposed to start straight-up fight with armies This game, it was capable of doing that a couple of times, purely because there was 20 mutas against like 18 Marines. But then, yeah, if there's one Thor to tank and 25 Marines to shoot at your muras and these Marines have 2-2 and your mudas have zero-zero, life is going to be hard But this was not at all the issue, like whatsoever I don't actually know what the issue was because you had way more units than your opponent the entire time Yes, your army com made no sense, but you obviously kind of out-macroed him, despite floating 10K resources Like you did nothing right but still were so far ahead And then you just lost your army by walking it into your opponent Then you left the game while you were still winning. You Gigi'd while you were double your opponent's supply, an entire mining base, plenty of time I can't believe your opponent asked you if No wait, you asked if he had a ninja base And he also replied truthfully, this is the Some insane gaming I actually don't understand this at all Like, I knew that some weird things were happening at the gold level, but the Terran looked kind of good I actually almost want to say that Zerk is completely in balance If people like you get to play on the same level as people like Pimki over here, like he had a real build order, he did a move out that was only a minute late. Your hatchery, your first hatchery was 22, 23 seconds too late everything You didn't have any units until the seven-minute mark If your opponent had harass you with a Benchie, a helion, done a hell-bat push, a standard timing, a proxy, actually, not a proxy racks You would have spotted the proxy racks But then again, you still would have probably built no units Like, oh, proxy racks That's interesting I actually think that Zirk at a lower level is overpowered If people like you can get to the same MMR as Pimki here, that is an issue, I think, that we need to address The night is in the main way This entire game was garbage Holy crap My friend, Thor's aren't in balance. A single Thor got built That's it, no? Yeah, a single Thor This guy has 24 kills Oh, yeah, that's actually kind of a big deal Some of these Marines also have six, seven kills, nine kills There's like the same Marines from earlier on because they never actually died Holy crap Yeah, the Thor isn't in balance You just suck, my friend This is an awful game Like, really awful Terrible, terrible stuff Alright, that's going to be it for me in today's episode of Is It Inbao or Do I Suck? If you did enjoy this, don't forget to hit the like button subscribe to the channel and hopefully I'll see all of you next time for a new video Bye-bye."
